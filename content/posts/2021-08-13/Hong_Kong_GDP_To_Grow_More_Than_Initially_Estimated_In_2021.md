The Hong Kong [economy][1] is forecast to grow more than previously
projected this year, according to the latest Half-yearly Economic Report
2021, released Friday.

Considering the robust real growth outturn in the first half of the year
and the support from the Consumption Voucher Scheme, the economy is
forecast to grow in the range of 5.5- 6.5 percent this year, up from the
previous outlook of 3.5-5.5 percent.  
  
Even if economic growth attains the upper bound of the latest range
forecast, real GDP for 2021 as a whole would still be about 2 percent
below the level in 2018, government said.

In the second quarter, real GDP grew notably by revised 7.6 percent
against a low base of comparison a year earlier, following an 8 percent
expansion in the first quarter, the Census and Statistics Department
said. The growth rate for the second quarter was revised up from 7.5
percent.

On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, real GDP fell
moderately by 0.9 percent in the second quarter, mainly reflecting the
high base created by the exceptionally strong performance of exports of
goods in the first quarter.

The second quarter GDP was revised up from -1.0 percent. GDP had
expanded 5.5 percent in the first quarter.

For the first half of 2021 as a whole, real GDP grew by 7.8 percent
year-on-year.  
The forecast rates of underlying and headline consumer price inflation
for 2021 were maintained at 1 percent and 1.6 percent respectively in
the current round of review.
