UK consumer sentiment remained unchanged in June, survey results from
market research group GfK showed on Friday.

The consumer confidence index held steady at -9.0 in June, while it was
forecast to rise to -7.0.

"A repetition of last month's score doesn't mean confidence is about to
nose-dive," Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said.

The upwards trajectory for the Index since the dark days at the start of
the pandemic is currently still on track, Staton said. However,
forecasts for rising retail price inflation could weaken consumer
confidence quickly.

Four measures of the index were up in comparison to the previous month,
while one measure was down.

The index measuring past changes in personal finances gained four points
to zero. The forecast for personal finances over the next year rose only
one point to +11.

The measure for the general economic situation over the last year edged
up one point to -47, while the expectations for the general economic
situation over the coming twelve months dropped by six points to -2.

The Major Purchase Index improved by two points to -5 and the Savings
Index was down one point to +21 in June.
