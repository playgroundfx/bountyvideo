UK retailers reported the fastest growth in sales in more than four
years in June, data released by the Confederation of British Industry
showed Friday.

The retail sales balance rose to +23 percent in June from -3 percent in
May. This was the highest level since November 2016.

This increase was the latest sign that the success of the vaccination
programme is feeding through to stronger consumer confidence which,
along with the re-opening of hospitality, is encouraging shoppers back
onto the streets, Ben Jones, principal economist at the CBI, said.

But the sector remains a long way from a full recovery, said Jones. The
return of demand is patchy, with inner-city footfall still well down.

Data showed that growth in internet sales slowed sharply in the year to
June, to the weakest pace since April 2020.

Wholesalers reported the most positive sales performance in relation to
seasonal norms since November 2018, with the balance rising to +34
percent from +18 percent.
