After reporting a sharp pullback in U.S. personal income in the previous
month, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing
personal income saw further downside in the month of May.

The Commerce Department said personal income slumped by 2.0 percent in
May after plunging by 13.1 percent in April. Economists had expected
personal income to tumble by 2.5 percent.

The continued decrease in personal income in May primarily reflected a
drop in government social benefits, as stimulus payments continued but
at a lower level.

Meanwhile, the report showed personal spending was virtually unchanged
in May after climbing by 0.9 percent in April. Personal spending was
expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

A reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal Reserve
showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth accelerated to 3.4
percent in May from 3.1 percent in April.
