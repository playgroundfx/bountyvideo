Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said the economic outlook
remains unusually uncertain despite fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures
taken to combat the downturn caused by the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, pandemic.

The measures taken by the central bank in March are working as expected.
The bank is prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary to
achieve the yield curve target, Lowe said a webinar on Thursday.

At the March meeting, the bank had reduced the cash rate to 0.25 percent
and unveiled a bond purchase programme and a three-year funding
facility.

However, there is a limit to what can be achieved with monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
Lowe said today.

The governor observed that one obvious source of uncertainty is the pace
at which the various restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19 are
eased. Another is the level of confidence that people have about their
future, both in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of their [health][2] and their own finances.

Responding to a question during an online panel discussion, Lowe said
the recovery will be slow without a Covid-19 vaccine. He noted that the
confidence is fragile and restoring it is important.

Regarding negative interest rate, Lowe said it is "extraordinarily
unlikely" as the costs of that exceed the benefits.
