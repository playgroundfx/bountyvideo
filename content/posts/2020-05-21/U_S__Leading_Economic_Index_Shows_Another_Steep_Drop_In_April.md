Suggesting the U.S. [economy][1] is now in recession territory, the
Conference Board released a report on Thursday showing a continued
nosedive by its reading on leading economic indicators.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index tumbled by 4.4
percent in April after plunging by a revised 7.4 percent in March.

Economists had expected the index to plummet by 5.9 percent compared to
the 6.7 percent slump originally reported for the previous month.

"In April, the US LEI continued on a downward trajectory, after posting
the largest decline in its 60-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in March," said Ataman
Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The Conference
Board.

He added, "The erosion has been very widespread, except for stock prices
and the interest rate spread which partially reflect the rapid and large
response of the Federal Reserve to offset the pandemic's impact and
support financial conditions.

The report said the coincident economic index cratered by 8.9 percent in
April after falling by 1.5 percent in the previous month.

On the other hand, the Conference Board said the lagging economic index
jumped by 4.1 percent in April after climbing by 1.7 percent in March.

"Business conditions may recover for some sectors and industries over
the next few months," said Bart van Ark, Chief Economist at the
Conference Board.

He added, "But, the breadth and depth of the decline in the LEI suggests
that an imminent re-opening of some sectors does not imply a fast
rebound for the economy at large."
