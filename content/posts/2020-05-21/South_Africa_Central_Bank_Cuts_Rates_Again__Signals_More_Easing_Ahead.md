South Africa's central bank reduced interest rates for a fourth
consecutive session and signaled more easing ahead as it expects a sharp
economic contraction this year, due to the disruption caused by the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic.

The Monetary Policy Committee decided to cut the repo rate by 50 basis
points to 3.75 percent, the South African Reserve Bank said in a
statement. The decision was in line with economists' expectations.  
  
The decision was taken in a split vote with three members preferring a
50 basis point cut, while two [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers sought a quarter-point
reduction.  
  
In April, the bank had cut the rate by 100 basis points. The SARB has
reduced the rate in each [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session thus far this year, starting
January.  
  
"The implied path of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates over the forecast period generated by
the Quarterly Projection Model indicates two repo rate cuts of 25 basis
points in the next two quarters of 2020," SARB Governor Lesetja Kganyago
said.  
  
The next [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement is scheduled for July 23.  
  
The SARB lowered its GDP forecast for this year and now expects a 7
percent contraction versus 6.1 percent predicted in April.  
  
Investment, exports and imports are expected to decline sharply in
coming months and job losses are expected to increase even after the
lockdown in withdrawn, the bank said.

Easing of the lockdown will support growth in the near term and some
high frequency activity indicators show a pickup in spending from
extremely low levels, the bank said, adding that getting back to pre-
pandemic activity levels will take time.  
  
The central bank expects GDP to grow by 3.8 percent in 2021 and by 2.9
percent in 2022.

Headline consumer price inflation is forecast to average 3.4 percent
this year and 4.4 percent in 2021 and 2022. Core inflation is seen lower
at 3.5 percent this year and 3.8 percent in 2021, and 4.1 percent in
2022.
