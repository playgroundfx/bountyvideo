Hong Kong's consumer price inflation eased in April to its lowest level
in three months, data from the Census and Statistics Department showed
on Thursday.

The consumer price index rose 1.9 percent year-on-year in April, after a
2.3 percent increase in March. The inflation rate was the lowest since
January, when it was 1.4 percent.

The smaller year-on-year rate of change in the Composite CPI in April
was partly attributable to the higher base of comparison caused by the
lowering of rates concession ceiling to HK$1,500, starting from April
2019, from $2,500 per quarter, the agency said.

Excluding the effects of all government's one-off relief measures, core
inflation was 2.3 percent in April, after a 2.6 percent rise in the
previous month. The slowing was mainly due to the smaller increases in
private housing rentals and the decreases in the fuel cost variation
charge for towngas.

"The underlying consumer price inflation rate went down to 2.3 percent
in April, as price pressures on most major CPI components receded,
offsetting the slight increase in food inflation," the government
spokesman said.

"Looking ahead, inflationary pressure is likely to ease further in the
near term." The government expect domestic cost pressures to continue to
abate amid the severe economic recession and external price pressures to
subside further in view of the plunging global demand and the recent
strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar along with the US dollar.

"The Government will continue to monitor the inflation situation
closely, particularly the impact on the lower-income people," the
spokesman added.
