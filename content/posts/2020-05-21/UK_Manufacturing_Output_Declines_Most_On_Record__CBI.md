UK manufacturing output declined at the fastest pace on record in May as
factories are grappling with the impact of the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic, survey results from the Confederation of British Industry
showed Thursday.

The output volume balance fell to -54 percent in May from -21 percent in
April, the Industrial Trends Survey revealed. This was the fastest fall
since records began in 1975.

The decline was largely driven by motor vehicles and transport and food,
drink and tobacco sub-sectors.

A net balance of -49 percent expects output to fall in the next three
months.

The total order book balance declined to -62 percent in May from -56
percent in April. This was the weakest since October 1981. The score was
forecast to fall to -59.

The export order book balance came in at -55 percent, the lowest since
1998.

"Production levels have fallen even more sharply as firms experience
collapsing demand and supply chain disruption, leading some to
temporarily shut down their factories," Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief
Economist, said.

"The sector is bracing for what will be a challenging period," the
economist said.
