The total volume of retail sales in New Zealand was down a seasonally
adjusted 0.7 percent on quarter, Statistics New Zealand said on Friday -
following the downwardly revised flat reading in the three months prior
(originally a 0.7 percent increase).

The value of retail sales (with price effects included) fell 0.4 percent
(NZ$89 million) as 10 of the 16 regions showed lower sales values.

On a yearly basis, retail sales advanced 2.3 percent - slowing from the
3.3 percent increase in the previous three months.
