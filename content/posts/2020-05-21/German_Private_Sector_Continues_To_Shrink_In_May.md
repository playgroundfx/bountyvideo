Germany's private sector continued to shrink in May, albeit the rate of
decline eased from the record fall seen in April, flash survey results
from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The headline flash composite output index rose to 31.4 in May from
April's record low of 17.4. But the score was below economists' forecast
of 34.1.

Despite an improvement, the score was the second-lowest figure since
comparable data first compiled in 1998. A reading below 50 indicates
contraction.

Data showed steep falls in manufacturing production and services
[business][1] activity, though in both cases the rates of contraction
were discernibly slower than in April amid the reopening of parts of the
economy after the coronavirus outbreak.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 31.4 from 16.2 in the
previous month. The expected level was 26.6.

At the same time, the manufacturing PMI came in at 36.8 versus 34.5 in
the previous month and below forecast of 39.2.
