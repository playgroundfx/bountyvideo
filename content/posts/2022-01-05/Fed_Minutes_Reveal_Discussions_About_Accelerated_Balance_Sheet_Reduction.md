Members of the Federal Reserve are preparing to begin reducing the size
of the central bank's balance sheet soon after raising interest rates,
the minutes of the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting
revealed.

The minutes of the December 14-15 meeting, released on Wednesday, showed
participants had initial discussions about the appropriate conditions
and timing for reducing the Fed's approximately $8.8 trillion portfolio
of Treasury and mortgage securities.

While the previous balance sheet runoff commenced almost two years after
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate liftoff, participants judge that the appropriate timing this
time around would likely be closer to that of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate liftoff.

"They noted that current conditions included a stronger economic
outlook, higher inflation, and a larger balance sheet and thus could
warrant a potentially faster pace of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate normalization," the
minutes said.

The minutes noted many participants also judged that the appropriate
pace of balance sheet runoff would likely be faster than it was during
the previous normalization episode.

The discussions about reducing the size of the central bank's balance
sheet came as the Fed also agreed to accelerate the pace of reductions
to its asset purchases, with the program currently slated to come to an
end in mid-March.

Many economists expect the Fed to begin raising interest rates as soon
as the asset program ends, with CME's FedWatch Tool currently indicating
a 71.0 percent chance of a rate hike at the March 15-16 meeting.

The minutes noted that participants generally agreed it may be warranted
to raise rates sooner or at a faster pace previously anticipated given
the outlook for the [economy][1], the labor market, and inflation.

"Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a
strong commitment to address elevated inflation pressures," the minutes
said.

The Fed added, "These participants noted, however, that a measured
approach to tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would help enable the Committee to assess
incoming data and be in position to react to the full range of plausible
economic outcomes."

Commenting on the minutes, Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at
Capital Economics, said it makes sense that quantitative tightening
should be more rapid this time around, as the balance sheet is much
larger than the previous peak and economic conditions much stronger.
