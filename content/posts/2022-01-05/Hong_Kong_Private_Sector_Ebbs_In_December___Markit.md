The private sector in Hong Kong continued to expand in December, albeit
at a slower rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 50.8.

That's down from 52.6 in November, although it remains above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The rates of expansion of both new orders and output eased, which led to
slower buying activity growth while job shedding accelerated in
December. Supply constraints persisted with worsening vendor performance
and rising price pressures contributing to an increase in backlogged
work. Overall [business][1] sentiment nevertheless improved in December
with hopes of continued economic recovery.

Amid the sustained increase in demand and output, Hong Kong SAR private
sector firms lifted their level of purchasing activity, which led to
higher stocks of purchases.
