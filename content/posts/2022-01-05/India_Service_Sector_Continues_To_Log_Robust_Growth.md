India's service sector continued to log robust growth in December
despite a slight slowdown from November, survey results from IHS Markit
showed on Wednesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a three-month low of
55.5 from 58.1 in the previous month. Nonetheless, a score above 50.0
indicates expansion in the sector.  
  
The upturn was often associated with improving market conditions and
accommodative demand. Despite robust gains in new work in recent months,
companies were able to stay on top of workloads and as a consequence
reduced headcounts at the end of 2021.

Business confidence rose to a four-month high but remained subdued as
several firms were concerned about price pressures and the possibility
of new waves of COVID-19.

The survey showed that rates of input cost and output charge inflation
eased in December.

Further, the survey showed that the composite output index slipped to
56.4 from 59.2 in November, but remained above its long-run average of
53.9. Both manufacturing production and services activity rose at
slower, albeit [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly strong, rates.
