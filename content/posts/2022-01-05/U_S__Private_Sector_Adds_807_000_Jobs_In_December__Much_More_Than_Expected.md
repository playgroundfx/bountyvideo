Private sector employment in the U.S. surged by much more than expected
in the month of December, according to a report released by payroll
processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment spiked by 807,000 jobs in December
after jumping by a revised 505,000 jobs in November.

Economists had expected private sector employment to increase by 400,000
jobs compared to the addition of 534,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"December's job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta
variant faded and Omicron's impact had yet to be seen," said ADP chief
economist Nela Richardson.

The much stronger than expected private sector job growth reflected
broad-based gains, with employment in the service-providing sector
soaring by 669,000 jobs amid a jump in leisure/hospitality jobs.

Employment in the goods-producing sector also shot up by 138,000 jobs in
December, reflecting the strongest job growth of the year.

The report also showed employment at large businesses surged by 389,000
jobs, while medium and small businesses added 214,000 jobs and 204,000
jobs, respectively.

"December's job growth brought the fourth quarter average to 625,000,
surpassing the 514,000 average for the year," Richardson noted.

She added, "While job gains eclipsed 6 million in 2021, private sector
payrolls are still nearly 4 million jobs short of pre-COVID-19 levels."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 400,000 jobs in
December after rising by 210,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate
is expected to edge down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent.
