Private sector employment in the U.S. surged by much more than expected
in the month of December, according to a report released by payroll
processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment spiked by 807,000 jobs in December
after jumping by a revised 505,000 jobs in November.

Economists had expected private sector employment to increase by 400,000
jobs compared to the addition of 534,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"December's job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta
variant faded and Omicron's impact had yet to be seen," said ADP chief
economist Nela Richardson.
