South Africa's private sector contracted in December, survey data from
IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.4 in December from
51.7 in November. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the
sector.

"Despite the government's decision to keep COVID-19 measures at Level 1,
[business][1] activity in South Africa fell sharply in response to the
Omicron wave during December," David Owen, an economist at IHS Markit,
said.

Output declined at the fastest pace in five months in December and new
orders fell sharply.

The outlook for the next 12 months remained strong and above the series
trend.

The staffing number remained stable in December. Backlogs of work
declined for the first time in ten months and at the quickest rate since
September 2020.

Delivery time lengthened in December.

Input prices increased further in December and selling costs rose
sharply.
