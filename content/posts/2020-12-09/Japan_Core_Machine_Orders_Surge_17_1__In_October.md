The value of core machine orders in Japan jumped a seasonally adjusted
17.1 percent on month in October, the Cabinet Office said on Wednesday -
coming in at 842.5 billion yen.

That blew away expectations for a gain of 2.8 percent following the 4.4
percent drop in September.

On a yearly basis, core machine orders gained 2.8 percent - again
handily beating expectations for a decline of 11.3 percent following the
11.5 percent drop in the previous month.

For the fourth quarter of 2020, core machine orders are predicted to
sink 1.9 percent on quarter and 13.2 percent on year.

The total value of machinery orders received by 280 manufacturers
operating in Japan increased 9.7 percent on month and eased 0.6 percent
on year in October at 2,300.3 billion yen.
