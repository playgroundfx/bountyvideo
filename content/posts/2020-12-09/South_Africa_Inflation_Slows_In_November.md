South Africa's consumer price inflation eased in November, figures from
Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 3.2 percent year-on-year in November,
after a 3.3 percent increase in October. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

The main contributions to the annual inflation came from food and non-
alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and
services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 5.8 percent
annually in November and housing and utilities cost rose by 2.9 percent.

Prices of miscellaneous goods and services rose 6.8 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer price remained unchanged in
November. Economists had expected a 0.1 percent rise.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.3 percent in November. Economists had expected a
3.4 percent increase.

On a monthly basis, the core CPI remained unchanged in November.
Economists had forecast a rise of 0.1 percent.
