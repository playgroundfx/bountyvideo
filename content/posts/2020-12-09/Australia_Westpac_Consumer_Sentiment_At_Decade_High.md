Australia's consumer confidence reached its highest level in a decade in
November after the relaxation of Covid-19 control measures, survey data
from Westpac showed Wednesday.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment climbed 4.1
percent to 112 in December from 107.7 in November. This was the highest
reading since October 2010.

The '[economy][1], next 12 months' sub-index rose 9.9 percent to 111.9,
the highest in ten years. Similarly, the 'economy, next five years' sub-
index advanced 5.9 percent to 121.1, the strongest reading since
December 2009.

Views around family finances showed mixed moves in the month. The
'finances vs a year ago' sub-index gained 6.9 percent to 96.1, but
remained below 100. However, the 'finances, next 12 months' sub-index
fell 1.8 percent to 108.9.

The 'time to buy a major household item' sub-index advanced 0.7 percent
to be up 5.9 percent on this time last year.

The survey showed that the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Unemployment
Expectations Index dropped 16.2 percent to 106.3 implying a major easing
in job loss concerns.

The 'time to buy a dwelling' index moved off last month's seven year
high, declining 5.9 percent to 124.2 in November.

The Reserve Bank Board next meets on February 2. While the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
almost certain to remain unchanged at the meeting, the bank is set to
lower its unemployment forecasts and raise growth forecasts, Bill Evans,
chief economist at Westpac said.
