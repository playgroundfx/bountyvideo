China's consumer prices declined for the first time in more than a
decade in November due to the fall in pork prices, data released by the
National Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday.

Consumer prices fell unexpectedly by 0.5 percent year-on-year in
November after rising 0.5 percent a month ago.

This was the first decline since October 2009. Economists had forecast
an increase of 0.8 percent.

Food prices decreased 2 percent annually due to a notable 12.5 percent
fall in pork prices. Pork prices had logged a sharp increase in the last
year due to the shortage caused by the African swine flu.

Core inflation that excludes food and energy prices climbed 0.5 percent
from last year in November.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices were down 0.6 percent versus the
expected fall of 0.2 percent.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said producer prices
decreased 1.5 percent on year in November but slower than October's 2.1
percent decline. Prices were expected to fall 1.8 percent.

The decline in consumer prices is not evidence of faltering demand,
Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital Economics,
said. To the contrary, broader price pressures are starting to pick up
on the back of the improvement in economic activity.

The People's Bank of China will look through this and focus on
underlying inflation which is likely to pick up in the coming months as
economic activity remains strong, the economists said.

Low headline inflation is unlikely to prevent the People's Bank from
tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) next year, they added.
