Consumer prices in China were down 0.5 percent on year in November, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.

That missed expectations for a flat reading following the 0.5 percent
increase in October.

On a monthly basis, inflation sank 0.6 percent, again missing estimates
for a fall of 0.2 percent following the 0.3 percent slide in the
previous month.

The bureau also said that producer prices dropped 1.5 percent on year -
but that beat forecasts for a decline of 1.8 percent following the 2.1
percent drop a month earlier.
