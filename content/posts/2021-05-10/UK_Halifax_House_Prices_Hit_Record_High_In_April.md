UK house prices reached a record high in April as stamp duty holiday
continued to provide impetus to the property market, data from Lloyds
Bank subsidiary Halifax and IHS Markit showed on Monday.

House prices grew 1.4 percent month-on-month in April, following a 1.1
percent rise in March. The average property was valued at GBP 258,204.

On a yearly basis, house prices growth accelerated to 8.2 percent from
6.5 percent a month ago. This was the highest annual rate in five years.

In three months to April, house prices were 0.9 percent higher than in
the preceding three months.

The stamp duty holiday magnified the shortage of available property for
sale as buyers aim to take advantage of the government scheme, Russell
Galley, Managing Director at Halifax, said. Nonetheless, the influence
of the stamp duty holiday will fade gradually over months ahead as it is
tapered out.

"There is growing optimism in the long-term outlook of the UK
[economy][1] as the vaccination programme continues at pace, yet we
remain cautious about the medium-term prospects of the housing market,"
Galley said.

"As we said in March, the current levels of uncertainty and potential
for higher unemployment as furlough support ends leads us to believe
that house price growth will slow to the end of the year," Galley added.
