The German economic recovery is likely to continue in the current
quarter, albeit at a much slower pace, Bundesbank said in its monthly
report on Monday.  
  
The central bank said economic output is likely to have risen sharply in
the third quarter.

Gross domestic product could have made up for a little more than half of
the drastic slump in the first half of the year, Bundesbank observed.
Nevertheless, around 5 percent are still missing compared to the pre-
crisis level from the last quarter of 2019.

According to ifo survey, sectors such as the hospitality industry in
particular are likely to be affected by the recent sharp rise in the
number of infections and the containment measures that have therefore
been expanded in some regions.

The experts assumed that economic output will only increase
comparatively little in the current quarter, Bundesbank said.
