New home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly showed a sharp decrease in the
month of September, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Monday.

The report said new home sales tumbled by 3.5 percent to an annual rate
of 959,000 in September after jumping by 3 percent to a revised rate of
994,000 in August. The pullback surprised economists, who had expected
new home sales to surge up by 2.8 percent.

"We expect the pace of sales to moderate further in the fourth quarter,"
said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "While strong demand and low mortgage rates are supportive of
home sales, the resurgence in Covid-19 cases, a recovery that may be
shifting into reverse and a weak labor market pose downside risks."

The unexpected pullback in new home sales was partly due to a steep drop
in sales in the Northeast, which plunged by 28.9 percent to a rate of
32,000.

New home sales in the Midwest and South also slumped by 4.1 percent and
4.7 percent, respectively, while new home sales in the West spiked by
3.8 percent.

The Commerce Department also said the median sales price of new houses
sold in September was $326,800, up 1.4 percent from $322,400 in August
and up 3.5 percent from $315,700 in the same month a year ago.

The estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 284,000,
representing a supply of 3.6 months at the current sales rate.

Last Thursday, the National Association of Realtors released a report
showing a much bigger than expected spike in U.S. existing home sales in
the month of September.

NAR said existing home sales soared by 9.4 percent to an annual rate of
6.54 million in September after jumping by 2 percent to a revised rate
of 5.98 million in August.

Economists had expected existing home sales to surge up by 5.0 percent
to a rate of 6.30 million from the 6.00 million originally reported for
the previous month.
