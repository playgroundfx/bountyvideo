China's exports grew more than expected in March and imports logged an
unexpected fall largely due to the lockdown and supply chain
disruptions, official data revealed on Wednesday.

Exports grew 14.7 percent on a yearly basis in March, the General
Administration of Customs said. This was faster than the expected growth
of 13.0 percent but slower than the 16.3 percent expansion posted in
January to February period.

Meanwhile, imports dropped 0.1 percent from the last year, confounding
expectations for an increase of 8.0 percent. Imports had increased 15.5
percent in the first two months of the year.

As a result, the trade surplus came in at $47.38 billion in March, which
was well above the expected level of $22.4 billion.

While disruptions from the latest COVID-19 outbreak are partly to blame
for the fall in goods trade, shifts on the demand-side played a bigger
role, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital
Economics, said.

Economists said [export volumes are set to fall][1] further over the
coming quarters. Import volumes are also likely to remain soft.

High commodity prices will continue to prop up import values in the
near-term, they said. But prices are expected to drop back during the
second half of the year as uncertainty surrounding the war in Ukraine
eases.
