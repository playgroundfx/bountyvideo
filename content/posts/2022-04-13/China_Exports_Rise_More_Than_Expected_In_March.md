China's exports grew more than expected and imports logged an unexpected
fall in March, reports said citing data from the General Administration
of Customs on Wednesday.

Exports grew 14.7 percent on a yearly basis in March, faster than the
expected growth of 13.0 percent, reports said.

Meanwhile, imports dropped 0.1 percent from the last year, confounding
expectations for an increase of 8.0 percent.

As a result, the trade surplus came in at $47.38 billion in March, well
above the expected level of $22.4 billion.
