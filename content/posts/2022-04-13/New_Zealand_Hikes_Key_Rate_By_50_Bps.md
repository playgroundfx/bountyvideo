New Zealand's central bank lifted its key interest rate by half a
percentage point, the biggest increase in over two decades, to head off
rising inflation expectations and minimize any unnecessary volatility in
the future.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised
the Official Cash Rate by 50 basis points to 1.50 percent at its meeting
on Wednesday. The bank hiked the rate for a fourth [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session in a
row.

The latest hike was the biggest since May 2000, when the OCR was raised
by a similar volume.

The previous change was [a quarter-point hike in February][1].

The MPC agreed it is appropriate to continue to tighten monetary
conditions at the current pace to best maintain price stability and
support maximum sustainable employment.

"The Committee agreed that their [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) 'path of least regret' is to
increase the OCR by more now, rather than later, to head off rising
inflation expectations and minimize any unnecessary volatility in
output, interest rates, and the exchange rate in the future," the bank
said.

"The Committee agreed to a 50 basis point rise in the OCR, consistent
with this least regrets analysis," the bank added.

Members observed that moving the interest rate to a more neutral stance
sooner will reduce the risks of rising inflation expectations. A larger
move now also provides more [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) flexibility ahead in light of the
highly uncertain global economic environment.

Further, the committee noted that heightened global economic uncertainty
and inflation are [dampening consumer confidence][2]. The rise in
mortgage interest rates, amongst other factors, have acted to reduce
mortgage demand and house prices.

However, economic capacity pressures remain, with a broad range of
indicators highlighting domestic capacity constraints and ongoing
inflation pressures, the committee said.

The committee viewed that house prices are moving towards a more
sustainable level.

Today's RBNZ decision to accelerate its hiking cycle shows it is willing
to move decisively to get a hand on surging inflation, Ben Udy, an
economist at Capital Economics, said. The economist expects the rate to
rise to 3.0 percent by the end of this year.
