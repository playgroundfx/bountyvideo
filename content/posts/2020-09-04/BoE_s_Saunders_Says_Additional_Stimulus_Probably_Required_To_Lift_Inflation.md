Additional monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing would be required to bring inflation
to the target, Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee Member Michael
Saunders said Friday.

"I consider it quite likely that additional monetary easing will be
appropriate in order to achieve a sustained return of inflation to the
2% target," he said in an online webinar.

"There is no automatic time limit on our willingness to maintain a loose
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance," he said.

At the August MPC meeting, the BoE had forecast inflation to turn
briefly negative in the near term, falling to -0.3 percent in August
driven by VAT cut and 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme.

Saunders said the BoE does not intend to tighten [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until there is
clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating
spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation target sustainably.

Further, he said the faster-than-expected rebound in the [economy][1]
over the last few months has reflected a benign window in which large
fiscal support has coincided with the relaxation of lockdown measures
and low infection rates. "This window may now be closing," he said.

A downside scenario to the economy would be very costly, the banker
added.
