The UK construction sector growth moderated in August from a near five-
year high largely due to the lack of new work to replace completed
contracts, survey results from IHS Markit showed Friday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction
Purchasing Managers' Index fell unexpectedly to 54.6 in August from 58.1
in July.  
  
The score was forecast to climb to 58.5. Nonetheless, a score above 50
indicates expansion.

"The latest PMI data signalled a setback for the UK construction sector
as the speed of recovery lost momentum for the first time since the
reopening phase began in May," Tim Moore, economics director at IHS
Markit, said.

House building registered the strongest rebound since the stoppages of
work on site in late-March due to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.
Commercial work expanded, while civil engineering activity contracted in
August.

Total new [business][2] volumes increased for the third month but the
pace of expansion moderated from July. Construction companies noted that
economic uncertainty and a wait-and-see approach among clients had
limited their opportunities to secure new work.  
  
Subdued order books held back output growth in August. Further, supply
chain disruption persisted across the construction sector.

Despite reporting subdued new business intakes, construction companies
reported an improvement in their business expectations for the year
ahead.

However, an expected rise in business activity could not prevent a
further drop in staffing numbers. The rate of job shedding eased only
slightly since July.
