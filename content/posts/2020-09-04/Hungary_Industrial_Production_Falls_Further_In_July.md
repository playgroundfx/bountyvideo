Hungary's industrial production declined for the fifth straight month in
July, albeit at a slower pace, data from the Hungarian Central
Statistical Office showed on Friday.

Industrial production declined a working-day adjusted 7.7 percent year-
on-year in July, following a 12.2 percent decrease in June.

The effects of the economic processes caused by the [coronavirus][1]
epidemic were still perceptible in this period, the agency said.

On a non-adjusted basis, industrial production decreased 8.1 percent
annually in July, following a 7.8 percent fall in the preceding month.

A significant fall was observed in the manufacture of transport
equipment, while the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical
products grew. The manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco
products declined slightly, the agency said.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production rose 7.2 percent
monthly in July, after a 17.2 percent growth in the prior month.
