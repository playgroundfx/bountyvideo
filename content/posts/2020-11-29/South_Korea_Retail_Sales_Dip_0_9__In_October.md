The total value of retail sales in South Korea was down a seasonally
adjusted 0.9 percent on month in October, Statistics Korea said on
Monday.

That missed expectations for a decline of 0.5 percent following the 1.7
percent increase in September.

On a yearly basis, retail sales eased 0.2 percent - again shy of
forecasts for a gain of 1 percent following the 4.4 percent increase in
the previous month.
