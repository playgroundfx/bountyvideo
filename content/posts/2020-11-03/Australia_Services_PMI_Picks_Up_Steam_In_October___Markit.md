The services sector in Australia continued to expand in October, and at
a faster pace, the latest survey from IHS Market revealed on Wednesday
with a seasonally adjusted services PMI score of 53.7.

That's up from 50.8 in September and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new [business][1] rose again, albeit marginally, while
employment shrunk at a slower rate. Business sentiment was at its
strongest in more than two years.

With sales growth still subdued, firms were able to work through
previously-placed orders, resulting in a third straight monthly decline
in backlogs of work, though the latest depletion was the weakest in this
sequence.

The survey also showed that the composite index came in at 53.5, up from
51.1 in the previous month.
