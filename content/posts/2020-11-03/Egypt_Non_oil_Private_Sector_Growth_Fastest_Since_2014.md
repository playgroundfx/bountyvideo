Egypt's non-oil private sector expanded in October at the strongest pace
since the end of 2014, data from the IHS Markit revealed on Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, climbed to 51.4 in October from
50.4 in September. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the
sector.

Firms increased their capacity due to the loosening of Covid-19
restrictions and the rate of activity growth was the fastest since
August 2014.

New orders rose at a quicker rate in October and to the greatest extend
in over six years and new export [business][1] increased.

Backlogs of work rose for the sixth month in a row in October and
delivery time shortened for the fourth straight month.

Employment declined for the twelfth month in a row in October. Business
confidence worsened as sentiment regarding the coming 12 months of
activity decreased to the weakest since May.

Input prices rose at the fastest pace for thirteen months in October and
selling cost rose at the fastest pace since August last year.

"The relatively strong upturn will encourage businesses, but also
highlights the extent of the gap between current and pre-COVID activity
levels that firms still need to abridge," David Owen, Economist at IHS
Markit, said.

"Growth could accelerate further if restrictions remain loose, although
there are still enduring risks that may slow the recovery," Owen added.
