Malaysia's central bank maintained its key rate as widely expected on
Tuesday as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said the current stance to be appropriate and
accommodative.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to retain
the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 1.75 percent.

The cumulative reduction of 125 basis points in the key rate so far this
year will continue to provide stimulus to the [economy][1]. The bank
said it remains committed to utilize its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers as appropriate to
create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery.

The introduction of targeted measures to contain Covid-19 in several
states could affect the momentum of the recovery in the fourth quarter.
Nonetheless, growth for the year 2020 is expected to be within the
earlier forecasted range.

Supported by the recovery in global demand, turnaround in public and
private expenditure, economic activity is projected to improve further
in 2021.

The bank cautioned that downside risks to the outlook remain, stemming
mainly from ongoing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic globally and
domestically.

Headline inflation is forecast to average negative this year due to weak
global oil prices. But in 2021 inflation is projected to average higher.
Driven by continued spare capacity in the economy, underlying inflation
is expected to remain subdued next year.
