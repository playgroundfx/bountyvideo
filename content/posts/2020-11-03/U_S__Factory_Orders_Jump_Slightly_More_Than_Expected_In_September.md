New orders for U.S. manufactured goods showed a significant increase in
the month of September, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Tuesday.

The Commerce Department said factory orders jumped by 1.1 percent in
September after rising by a revised 0.6 percent in August.

Economists had expected factory orders to surge up by 1.0 percent
compared to the 0.7 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

The report said orders for durable goods spiked by 1.9 percent, while
orders for non-durable goods rose by 0.3 percent.

Shipments of manufactured goods increased for the fifth consecutive
month, rising by 0.3 percent in September following a matching uptick in
August.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said inventories were virtually
unchanged in September after coming in nearly unchanged in the previous
month.

The inventories-to-shipments ratio subsequently edged down to 1.42 in
September from 1.43 in August.
