Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector expanded for the second month in a
row in October, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to an eight-month high of 51.0 in
October from 50.7 in September. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in
the sector.

Output rose at the quickest pace since February and firms saw higher
activity often attributed to increase in sales, new contracts and
resumption of some projects.

The overall rate of demand growth softened in October and part of the
slowdown was due to a renewed fall in exports as firms struggled to
revive orders with foreign clients.

Business confidence declined for the first time since June, while firms
hope that activity continue to rise despite the ongoing pandemic.

The number of employed fell for the eighth straight month in October and
backlogs of work were reduced.

Input prices rose at the beginning of the fourth quarter and overall
selling prices fell fractionally for the first time since July.

"While the latest PMI data indicated a further expansion in the Saudi
Arabia non-oil private sector in October, there were reasons for fresh
concern about the pace of recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak," David
Owen, an economist at IHS Markit, said.

"Firms indicated that financial issues at some clients and a slow
resumption of projects have curbed the economic rebound since
restrictions eased," Owen said.
