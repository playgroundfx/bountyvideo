After reporting a slight decrease in regional manufacturing activity in
the previous month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a
report on Tuesday showing a modest increase in activity in the month of
February.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index rose to
a positive 3.1 in February from a negative 0.7 in January.

While a positive reading indicates growth in regional manufacturing
activity, economists had expected the index to show a more significant
rebound to a positive 12.2.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms were generally optimistic
about the six-month outlook, although optimism waned from the previous
month.
