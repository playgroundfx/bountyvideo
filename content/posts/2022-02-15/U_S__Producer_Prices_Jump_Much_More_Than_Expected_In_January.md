Producer prices in the U.S. jumped by much more than expected in the
month of January, according to a report released by the Labor Department
on Tuesday.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
surged up by 1.0 percent in January after rising by an upwardly revised
0.4 percent in December.

Economists had expected producer prices to increase by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.2 percent uptick originally reported for the previous
month.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices advanced by 0.9 percent in January after climbing by 0.4 percent
in December.

Meanwhile, the report showed the annual rate of producer price growth
slowed to 9.7 percent in January from 9.8 percent in December.

The annual rate of growth in core producer prices also decelerated to
6.9 percent in January from 7.0 percent in December.
