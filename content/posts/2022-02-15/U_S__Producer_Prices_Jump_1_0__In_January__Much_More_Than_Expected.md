Producer prices in the U.S. jumped by much more than expected in the
month of January, according to a report released by the Labor Department
on Tuesday.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
surged up by 1.0 percent in January after rising by an upwardly revised
0.4 percent in December.

Economists had expected producer prices to increase by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.2 percent uptick originally reported for the previous
month.

The sharp increase in producer prices was partly due to a substantial
rebound in energy prices, which spiked by 2.5 percent in January after
tumbling by 1.7 percent in December.

Food prices also showed a significant rebound, jumping by 1.6 percent in
January after dipping by 0.3 percent in the previous month.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices advanced by 0.9 percent in January after climbing by 0.4 percent
in December.

The report showed prices for services increased by 0.7 percent,
reflecting a 0.6 percent advance in prices for trade services and a 0.9
percent jump in prices for other services.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the annual rate of producer price
growth slowed to 9.7 percent in January from 9.8 percent in December.
Economists had expected the yearly growth to slow to 9.1 percent.

The annual rate of growth in core producer prices also decelerated to
6.9 percent in January from 7.0 percent in December.

"The combination of stubborn supply disruptions and elevated energy
prices will prevent producer prices from reverting to more normal
patterns until later this year," said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

He added, "The latest PPI figures reinforce the case for the FOMC to
commence rate liftoff at next month's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting with a rate hike of
at least 25bps."

Last Thursday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
the annual rate of U.S. consumer price growth accelerated more than
expected in January.

The report showed consumer prices in January were up by 7.5 percent
compared to the same month a year ago, reflecting the fastest annual
growth since February of 1982.

Economists had expected the annual rate of consumer price growth to
accelerate to 7.3 percent from 7.0 percent in December.

The faster year-over-year growth came as the Labor Department said its
consumer price index climbed by 0.6 percent in January, matching the
upwardly revised advance seen in December.

Economists had expected consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent, matching
the increase originally reported for the previous month.

The bigger than expected monthly increase in consumer prices reflected
higher prices for food, electricity, and shelter.

The report showed core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy
prices, also advanced by 0.6 percent in January, matching the increase
seen in December. Economists had also expected core prices to rise by
0.5 percent.

Along with higher prices for shelter, the increase in core pries
reflected higher prices for household furnishings and operations, used
cars and trucks, medical care and apparel.

The annual rate of growth in core prices accelerated to 6.0 percent in
January from 5.5 percent in December, showing the biggest jump since
August of 1982.
