The Dutch [economy][1] expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter
due to the lockdown announced in mid-December, data from Statistics
Netherlands showed on Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent sequentially, slower than the
2.1 percent expansion registered in the third quarter and 3.8 percent
rise in the second quarter.  
  
The expenditure-side breakdown showed that the quarterly growth was
driven by investment and net trade. Investment advanced 2.6 percent.
Exports were down 0.1 percent, while imports fell more sharply by 0.8
percent.

Household spending decreased 0.1 percent. By contrast, government
spending gained 0.7 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP advanced 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
following a 5.2 percent rise in the preceding quarter.

In 2021 as a whole, the economy expanded 4.8 percent, reversing the 3.8
percent contraction in 2020.

Even though the Netherlands ended its lockdown on January 26, it is
expected that the Dutch government will reduce Covid containment
measures even more on February 28,  
Marcel Klok, an ING economist, said. This may boost household
consumption further, up to the point that it may surpass its pre-
pandemic peak soon.

Another report from the statistical office showed that household
spending grew 4.5 percent in December as consumers spent more on
services and durable goods. However, the pace of growth in household
consumption eased from the 8.8 percent increase in November.  
  
In a separate communiqu√©, Statistics Netherlands said exports rose 8.1
percent annually in December driven by higher shipment of chemicals,
machines and equipments. At the same time, imports grew 6.6 percent from
the last year.
