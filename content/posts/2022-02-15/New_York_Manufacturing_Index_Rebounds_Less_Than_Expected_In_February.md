After reporting a slight decrease in regional manufacturing activity in
the previous month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a
report on Tuesday showing a modest increase in activity in the month of
February.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index rose to
a positive 3.1 in February from a negative 0.7 in January.

While a positive reading indicates growth in regional manufacturing
activity, however, economists had expected the index to show a more
significant rebound to a positive 12.2.

The modest rebound by the headline index partly reflected a turnaround
by new orders, with the new orders index climbing to a positive 1.4 in
February from a negative 5.0 in January.

The shipments index also rose to 2.9 in February from 1.0 percent in
January, while the number of employees index jumped to 23.1 from 16.1.

On the inflation front, the prices paid index edged down to 76.6 in
January from 76.7 in December, but the prices received index surged up
to 54.1 from 37.1.

The report also showed the unfilled orders index rose to 14.4 in
February from 12.1 in January, while the delivery time index held at
21.6.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms were generally optimistic
about the six-month outlook, although optimism waned from the previous
month.

The index for future business conditions slumped to 28.2 in February
from 35.1 in January, hitting the lowest level since the early stages of
the [coronavirus][2] pandemic.

The New York Fed said longer delivery times, higher prices, and
increases in employment are all expected in the months ahead.

"While Omicron's threat has faded and the [economy][3] is learning to
live with Covid, it will take time for manufacturers to clear the
backlogs and for operating conditions to normalize," said Oren Klachkin,
Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

On Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is scheduled to release
its report on regional manufacturing activity in January. The Philly Fed
Index is expected to dip to 20.0 in January from 23.2 in February.
