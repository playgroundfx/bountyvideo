German economic confidence strengthened in February despite rising
economic and political uncertainties, survey results from the ZEW -
Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research showed on Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment climbed 2.6 points to a seven-
month high of 54.3 points in February from 51.7 in January. However,
this was below the economists' forecast of 55.0.

The assessment of the economic situation also improved in the current
survey period. The corresponding indicator rose 2.1 points to -8.1
points.

"Financial market experts expect an easing of pandemic-related
restrictions and an economic recovery in the first half of 2022," ZEW
President Achim Wambach, said.

They still expect inflation to decline, albeit at a slower pace and from
a higher level than in previous months. Consequently, more than 50
percent of the experts predict that short-term interest rates in the
euro area will rise in the next six months, said Wambach.

The survey showed that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence in the euro area weakened in
February. The corresponding index dropped 0.8 points to 48.6 points.

The situation indicator climbed to a new level of 0.6 points,
corresponding to an increase of 6.8 points compared with the January
result.

Further, the survey showed that inflation expectations for the eurozone
gained 3.6 points in the current survey. The indicator came in at minus
35.1 points. About 53.2 percent of the experts expect the inflation rate
to decline in the next six months.
