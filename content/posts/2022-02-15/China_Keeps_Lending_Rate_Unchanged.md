China's central bank left its medium-term lending facility rate
unchanged on Tuesday as it gauges the impact of the previous reduction.

The People's Bank of China retained its one-year medium term lending
facility rate at 2.85 percent. The bank had reduced the rates on lending
facilities by 10 basis points in January.

In January, the one-year loan prime rate was reduced by 5 basis points
to 3.70 percent, which was the second consecutive reduction and the
five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage rates, was lowered for the
first time since April 2020, to 4.60 percent.

"We cannot conclude right now that the PBoC will stop easing in
February," Iris Pang, an ING economist, said. "We need to wait until Feb
20th, which we believe could result in a 5 basis points cut from 3.7
percent and 4.6 percent for the 1-year and 5-year LPR, respectively."

As the PBoC had vowed to further increase financial support to the real
[economy][1] in its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report released Friday, more easing
still looks to be on the horizon, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist
at Capital Economics, said.

The economist anticipates another 20 basis point of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate cuts and
100 basis point reduction in reserve requirements for large and medium-
sized banks by the middle of this year, along with a further modest
acceleration in credit growth.
