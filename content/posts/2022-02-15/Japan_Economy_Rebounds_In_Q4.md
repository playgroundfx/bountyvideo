Japan's [economy][1] rebounded in the fourth quarter of 2021 as the
easing of restrictions related to the pandemic boosted consumer
spending, data released by the Cabinet Office revealed on Tuesday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent sequentially, reversing a 0.7
percent fall in the third quarter. Economists had forecast a quarterly
growth of 1.4 percent.

On an annualized basis, the economic growth came in at 5.4 percent in
the fourth quarter, but weaker than the forecast of 5.8 percent.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that the growth was largely driven
by household spending and exports.

Private consumption gained 2.7 percent from the prior quarter, which was
faster than the expected growth of 2.2 percent and reversed the 0.9
percent drop in the third quarter.  
  
On the other hand, government spending decreased 0.3 percent after
rising 1.1 percent a quarter ago.

Private residential investment was down 0.9 percent, while private non-
residential investment grew 0.4 percent.

Exports of goods and services advanced 1 percent. Meanwhile, imports of
goods and services were down 0.3 percent.

While Omicron will cause Japan's economy to do little more than tread
water this quarter following a rebound in the fourth quarter, output
should soon resume its recovery and get back on its pre-virus trend by
the end of the year, Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.  
  
In the whole year of 2021, GDP expanded 1.7 percent after contracting
4.5 percent in 2020 and 0.2 percent fall in 2019.
