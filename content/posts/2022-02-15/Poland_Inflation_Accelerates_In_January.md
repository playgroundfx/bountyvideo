Poland's consumer price inflation accelerated further in January,
preliminary data from Statistics Poland showed on Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 9.2 percent year-on-year in January,
following an 8.6 percent increase in December.

Prices for dwellings grew 12.0 percent yearly in January. Prices for
food and non-alcoholic beverages, and alcoholic beverages and tobacco
rose by 9.4 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in January,
following a 0.9 percent increase in the previous month. This was in line
with economists' expectations.
