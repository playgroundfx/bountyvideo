Reflecting a spike in gasoline prices, the Labor Department released a
report on Wednesday showing U.S. consumer prices increased in line with
economist estimates in the month of December.

The report said the consumer price index rose by 0.4 percent in December
after edging up by 0.2 percent in November. The price growth matched
expectations.

The Labor Department said the advance by the consumer price index was
driven by an 8.4 percent jump in gasoline prices, which accounted for
more than 60 percent of the overall increase.

Excluding food and energy prices, the core consumer price index inched
up by 0.1 percent in December after rising by 0.2 percent in November.
The uptick in core prices also matched economist estimates.
