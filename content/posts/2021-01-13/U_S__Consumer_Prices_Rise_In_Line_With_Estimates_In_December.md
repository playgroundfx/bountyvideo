Reflecting a spike in gasoline prices, the Labor Department released a
report on Wednesday showing U.S. consumer prices increased in line with
economist estimates in the month of December.

The report said the consumer price index rose by 0.4 percent in December
after edging up by 0.2 percent in November. The price growth matched
expectations.

The Labor Department said the advance by the consumer price index was
driven by an 8.4 percent jump in gasoline prices, which accounted for
more than 60 percent of the overall increase.

The other components of the energy index were mixed, resulting in an
increase of 4.0 percent for the month.

Food prices also rose by 0.4 percent in December, as both the food at
home and the food away from home indexes increased by 0.4 percent.

Excluding food and energy prices, the core consumer price index inched
up by 0.1 percent in December after rising by 0.2 percent in November.
The uptick in core prices also matched economist estimates.

The modest increase in core prices reflected higher prices for apparel,
motor vehicle insurance, new vehicles, personal care, and household
furnishings and operations.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said prices for used cars and trucks,
recreation, and medical care were among those to decline over the month.

The report said consumer prices in December were up by 1.4 percent
compared to the same month a year ago, reflecting an acceleration from
the 1.2 percent growth seen in November.

The annual rate of growth by core consumer prices in December was
unchanged from the previous month at 1.6 percent.

"The benign core inflation readings support our call that the Fed does
not lift the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate from the effective lower bound until 2024 and
begin QE tapering until 2023," said Kathy Bostjancic, Chief U.S.
Financial Economist at Oxford Economics.

Bostjancic added, "Although additional fiscal stimulus could bring the
tightening forward by a year."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on producer price inflation in the month of December.

Producer prices are expected to increase by 0.3 percent in December
after inching up by 0.1 percent in November, while core producer prices
are expected to rise by 0.2 percent after edging up by 0.1 percent.
