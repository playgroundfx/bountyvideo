producer prices also increased by more than expected in the month of
April.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose

Economists had expected producer prices to increase by 0.3 percent.

Excluding prices for food, energy, and trade services, core producer
prices, advanced by 0.7 percent in April after climbing by 0.6 percent
in March. Core prices were expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

prices showing the biggest annual increase since 12-month data were
first calculated in November of 2010.
