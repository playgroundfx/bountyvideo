First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits fell by more than
expected in the week ended May 8th, according to a report released by
the Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 473,000, a decrease of
34,000 from the previous week's revised level of 507,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 490,000 from the
498,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims once again fell
to their lowest level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended March 14,
2020.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also slid to a more than one-year low of 534,000, a decrease of 28,250
from the previous week's revised average of 562,250.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also dropped by 45,000 to 3.655 million in the
week ended May 1st.

The four-week moving average fell to 3,665,000, a decrease of 13,250
from the previous week's revised average of 3,678,250.

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
employment in the U.S. increased by far less than expected in the month
of April.

The report said non-farm payroll employment rose by 266,000 jobs in
April after surging by a downwardly revised 770,000 jobs in March.

Economists had expected employment to spike by 978,000 jobs compared to
the jump of 916,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The Labor Department said notable job gains in leisure and hospitality,
other services, and local government education were partly offset by
employment declines in temporary help services and couriers and
messengers.

The report also showed the unemployment rate inched up to 6.1 percent in
April from 6.0 percent in March. Economists had expected the
unemployment rate to drop to 5.8 percent.
