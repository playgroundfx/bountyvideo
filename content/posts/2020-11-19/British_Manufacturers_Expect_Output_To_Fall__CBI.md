UK manufacturers expect output to decline at a slightly faster pace in
coming three months, the Industrial Trends Survey from the Confederation
of British Industry showed Thursday.

A net 10 percent of respondents forecast production to decline over the
next three months, marking a worsening in expectations compared to last
month's survey.

A balance of -6 percent said output volumes declined in the three months
to November, which was the slowest pace since September 2019.

"Output volumes have declined at their slowest pace in over a year in
our November survey," Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said.

"But order books have softened again as global demand has been hit by
intensified lockdowns, and manufacturers have trimmed their
expectations," the economist added.

The order books balance fell to -40 percent from -34 percent in October.
This was also below the long-term average of -14 percent.

The export order books balance came in at -51 percent versus -46 percent
in October.  
Manufacturers also expect output prices to fall in next three months.
