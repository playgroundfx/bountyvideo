In a bid to bolster the Turkish lira, the central bank lifted its key
rates drastically, as expected, on Thursday under the new governorship.

At the first [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting of Naci Agbal as governor of the Central
Bank of the Republic of Turkey, the Monetary Policy Committee raised the
key one-week repo rate sharply by 475 basis points to 10.25 percent from
15.00 percent.

All central bank funding will be provided through the one-week repo
rate, the bank said.

Early November, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan replaced TCMB Governor
Murat Uysal with former finance minister Agbal after the Turkish lira
fell to a record low this year.  
  
The latest hike was the sharpest in more than two years. In September,
the bank had raised the rate from 8.25 percent, which was the first
increase in two years.

The decision to hike its one-week repo rate by 475 basis points and
pledge to provide all funding through this facility appears to have done
enough to convince [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that there really is a positive shift in
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)making underway, Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

The economist expects the repo rate to be left at 15 percent until at
least the end of 2021.

The bank said the lagged effects of depreciation in Turkish lira,
increasing international food prices and deterioration in inflation
expectations affect the inflation outlook adversely.

The committee decided to implement a transparent and strong monetary
tightening in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain
inflation expectations and restore the disinflation process, the bank
said in the statement.  
  
Moreover, the bank said the tightness of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be
decisively sustained until a permanent fall in inflation is achieved.

The bank said it will attain the main objective of achieving and
maintaining price stability by adopting transparency, predictability and
accountability principles of the inflation targeting regime.

The committee noted that partial restrictions to curb the Covid-19
spread heightened uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic
activity.

Besides, strengthening domestic demand, due to the lagged effects of
strong credit impulse during the pandemic, affects the current account
balance adversely through the imports channel, the bank added.
