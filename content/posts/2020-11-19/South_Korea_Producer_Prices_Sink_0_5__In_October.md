Producer prices in South Korea were down 0.5 percent on month in
October, the Bank of Korea said on Friday.

That missed forecasts for a flat reading following the 0.1 percent
increase in September.

Individually, prices for agriculture, forestry and marine products
plummeted 9.6 percent on month, while utility prices were down 0.7
percent, manufacturing products eased 0.1 percent and services were
flat.

On a yearly basis, producer prices sank 0.6 percent versus expectations
for a lost of 0.1 percent after slipping 0.4 percent in the previous
month.
