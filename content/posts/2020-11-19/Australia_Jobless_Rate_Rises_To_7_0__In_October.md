The unemployment rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 7.0
percent in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Thursday.

That was below expectations for 7.2 percent and was up from 6.9 percent
in September.

The Australian [economy][1] added 178,800 jobs last month, far
surpassing expectations for the loss of 30,000 jobs after shedding
29,500 jobs in the previous month.

The participation rate jumped to 65.8 percent, beating forecasts for
64.7 percent and up from 64.8 percent a month earlier.
