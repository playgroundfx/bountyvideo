Fitch Ratings maintained the sovereign ratings of Brazil on Wednesday
citing its large and diverse [economy][1], high per capita income and
capacity to withstand external shocks.

The rating agency left its credit ratings at 'BB-' with a 'negative'
outlook.

Although the economy has flexible exchange rate, moderate external
imbalances, robust international reserves and deep domestic government
debt market, Fitch noted that it has rising government indebtedness, a
rigid fiscal structure, weak economic growth potential amid a difficult
political landscape.

The agency said the 'negative' outlook reflects the severe deterioration
in Brazil's fiscal deficit and public debt burden during 2020 and
persisting uncertainty regarding fiscal consolidation prospects,
including the sustainability of the 2016 spending cap given continued
spending pressures.

Fitch forecasts the Brazilian economy to contract by 5.0 percent in 2020
before expanding by 3.2 percent in 2022.
