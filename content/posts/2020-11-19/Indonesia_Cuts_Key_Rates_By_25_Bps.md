Indonesia's central bank reduced its key interest rates by 25 basis
points to underpin economic recovery.

The Board of Governors of Bank Indonesia decided to cut the BI 7-day
reverse repo rate to 3.75 percent from 4.00 percent.

The bank has reduced the rate by five times so this year, by a
cumulative 125 basis points.

Both the overnight deposit facility rate and the lending facility rate
were lowered by 25 basis points each to 3.00 percent and 4.50 percent,
respectively.

The central bank said the currency exchange rate strengthened largely
reflecting stabilization measures. The bank vowed to strengthen its
Rupiah exchange rate stabilization [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in line with its fundamentals.

The bank said the [economy][1] expanded in the third quarter driven by
stimulus and the relaxation of Covid-19 restriction measures. Economic
growth is predicted to pick up in 2021 on the back of the improving
global economy and accelerated budget realization.

The bank observed that inflation remained low in line with weak demand
and adequate supply.

Bank Indonesia forecasts 2020 inflation to be lower than the lower limit
of the inflation target and return to its target of 2.0 to 4 percent in
2021.
