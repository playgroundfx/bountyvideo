Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity has seen continued growth in
the month of November, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia revealed
in a report on Thursday, although the pace of growth slowed compared to
the previous month.

The report said the Philly Fed Index pulled back to 26.3 in November
after spiking to 32.3 in October, but a positive reading still indicates
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to drop to 22.0.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said most future indexes also moderated
this month but continue to indicate that firms expect growth over the
next six months.
