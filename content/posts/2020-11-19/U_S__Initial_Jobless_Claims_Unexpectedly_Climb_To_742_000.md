After reporting initial jobless claims at their lowest level since
before the [coronavirus][1]-induced lockdowns in the previous week, the
Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing an unexpected
rebound in jobless claims in the week ended November 14th.

The Labor Department said jobless claims climbed to 742,000, an increase
of 31,000 from the previous week's revised level of 711,000.

The rebound came as a surprise to economists, who had expected jobless
claims to edge down to 707,000 from the 709,000 originally reported for
the previous week.

Meanwhile, the report said the less volatile four-week moving average
fell to 742,000, a decrease of 13,750 from the previous week's revised
average of 755,750.
