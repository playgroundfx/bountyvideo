A reading on leading U.S. economic indicators increased in line with
economist estimates in the month of October, according to a report
released by the Conference Board on Thursday.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index climbed by 0.7
percent in October, matching the increase seen in the previous month as
well as expectations.

Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The
Conference Board, said the continued advance by the index reflected
widespread improvements despite weakness from housing permits and
consumers' outlook on economic conditions.

"However, the leading index has been decelerating in recent months,
which suggests growth will moderate significantly in the final months of
2020, slowing down from the unusually rapid pace in Q3," Ozyildirim
said.

He added, "Furthermore, downside risks to growth from a second wave of
COVID-19 and high unemployment persist."

The report said the coincident economic index also increased by 0.5
percent in October after rising by 0.4 percent in September.

Meanwhile, the lagging economic index inched up by 0.1 percent in
October following a 0.3 percent drop in the previous month.
