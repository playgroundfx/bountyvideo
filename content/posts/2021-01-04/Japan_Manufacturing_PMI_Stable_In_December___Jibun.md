The manufacturing sector in Japan improved in December to a level of
stability, the latest survey from Jibun Bank showed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 50.0.

That's up from 49.0 in November and it now sits right on the line that
separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output stabilized for the first time in 23 months and
employment rose for the first time since February.

New orders meanwhile, were reduced to the least marked extent of the
past two years. According to anecdotal evidence, confidence remained
downbeat due to the lingering impacts of the pandemic, although there
was evidence that conditions were improving, notably in the automotive
sector.
