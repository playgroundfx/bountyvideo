Sweden's manufacturing sector expanded strongly in December, amid
rebound in world trade and an improvement in optimism linked to the
vaccination against the [coronavirus][1], survey results from Swedbank
and the logistics association SILF showed on Monday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector climbed to
64.9 from 59.8 in November. Any reading above 50 suggests expansion in
the sector.

The latest monthly increase was the biggest since last summer, Swedbank
said.

All sub-indexes contributed to the improvement in December. The biggest
inputs came from those for supplier delivery times and employment.
