The manufacturing sector in South Korea continued to expand in December
at a steady pace, the latest survey from market Economics revealed on
Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 52.9.

That's unchanged from the November reading and it remains well above the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, there were sustained but softer rises in output and new
orders, while employment levels rose for the first time since April
2019. Business expectations remain positive.

South Korean manufacturers indicated a quicker expansion in purchasing
activity, with the respective seasonally adjusted Index reaching its
highest point since April 2010 as a result of increasing orders.
