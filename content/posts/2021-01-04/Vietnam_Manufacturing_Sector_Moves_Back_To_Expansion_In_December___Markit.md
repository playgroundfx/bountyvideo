The manufacturing sector in Vietnam climbed back into expansion
territory in December, the latest survey from market Economics revealed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.7.

That's up from November and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of 50
that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, a sharper rise in new orders supported an increase in
production. Supplier delivery times lengthened markedly, and December
saw the fastest rise in input costs since June 2018.

Rising production and expanded workforce numbers meant that firms were
able to reduce backlogs of work, and to the greatest extent since
August.
