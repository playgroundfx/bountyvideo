China's manufacturing sector growth moderated at the end of 2020 as
output and new work logged slower expansions, survey results from IHS
Markit revealed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.0 in December
from 54.9 in the previous month. The score was also below economists'
forecast of 54.8.

The pace of growth was the slowest in three months. Nonetheless, the
score signaled that the sector continued to recover from the Covid-19
outbreak.

According to official PMI survey, the factory Purchasing Managers' Index
fell to 51.9 from 52.1 in November.

The overall slowdown was caused by the slower increase in production,
the private survey showed. Firms also reported slower increase in
overall new orders due to moderate rise in foreign demand.

Firms were cautious regarding employment as cost cutting initiatives
weighed on recruitment.

Manufacturers reported a sharp increase in average input costs in
December. The rate of inflation was the steepest recorded for three
years and led to a quicker rise in prices charged by manufacturers.

Chinese goods producers generally expect production to be higher than
current levels in one year's time amid forecasts of firmer global demand
conditions and an end to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group said, "In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
the trend, we expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to
continue for several months, and macroeconomic indicators will be
stronger in the next six months, taking into account the low bases in
the first half of 2020."
