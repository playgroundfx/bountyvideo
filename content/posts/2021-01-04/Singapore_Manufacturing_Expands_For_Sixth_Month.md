Singapore's manufacturing sector expanded for a sixth straight month
amid further expansion in the electronics sector, survey data from the
SIPMM Institute showed on Monday.

The purchasing manager's index for the manufacturing sector edged up to
50.5 from 50.4 in November. A reading above 50 suggests growth in the
sector. In October, the score was 50.5.

The PMI for the electronics sector also added a 0.1 point to reach 51.2
in December. The sector grew for the fifth month in a row and the
reading was the highest since September 2018, when it was 51.4.
