Denmark's manufacturing sector contracted at a steep rate in December
amid sharp declines in new orders and production, survey data from the
logistics association DILF showed on Monday.

The purchasing manager's index for the manufacturing sector fell to 41.9
from 47 in November. Any reading below 50 suggests decline in activity.

The sub-indexes for new orders and production dropped steeply by around
10 points and reached below the 40-mark.

Suppliers' delivery time and stock of purchased products were the only
sub-indexes to rise in December.
