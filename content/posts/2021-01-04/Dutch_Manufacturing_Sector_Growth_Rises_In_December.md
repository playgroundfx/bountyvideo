The Dutch manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in December,
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The NEVI manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 58.2
in December from 54.4 in November. Any reading above 50.0 indicates
expansion in the sector.

Factory production rose at the quickest pace for two years in December
and total new orders increased, with the rate of expansion quickest
since early 2018.

Purchasing activity increased sharply for twenty-seven months in
December and suppliers' delivery time lengthened to the greatest extend
since April.

Input prices increased for the fifth straight month in December and
output charges rose at the fastest pace since January last year.

The rate of job creation quickened in December and rose for the second
straight month. Backlogs of work rose for the first time since March.

Confidence with regard to output for the 12-months remained robust in
December. The future output index remained unchanged and the joint-
highest for over two years.

"It seems that demand is rising because the economic outlook has
improved thanks to the vaccine [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)," Albert Jan Swart, manufacturing
sector economist at ABN AMRO, said.
