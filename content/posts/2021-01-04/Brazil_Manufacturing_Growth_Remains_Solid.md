Brazil's manufacturing continued to expand at a solid rate in December,
though the pace slowed, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The purchasing manager's index for the manufacturing sector fell to 61.5
from 64.0 in November. A reading above 50 suggests expansion in the
sector.

Output growth was underpinned by strong gains in new orders. Employment
grew for a sixth month, albeit at a slower rate, but the pace remained
solid. The increase in input buying accelerated.

Supplier delivery times rose sharply mainly due to difficulties in
obtaining key materials. Input costs increased and part of that increase
was passed on to clients through higher charges.

"Looking ahead, companies were optimistic that output levels would
increase in 2021, but hopes were pinned on the COVID-19 pandemic coming
to an end, the approval of government reforms and an improvement in
material availability," Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director
at IHS Markit, said.
