Greece's manufacturing activity contracted in December, but at a softer
pace, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index increased to 46.9 in
December from 42.3 in November. Any reading below 50.0 indicates
contraction in the sector.

Production declined further in December and client demand continued to
fall as the extended lockdown measures impacted new order inflow.

New export orders decreased in December and suppliers' time lengthened.

Cost burden increased at the fastest pace since March 2011 and output
charges declined fractionally.

The rate of job shedding eased in December and the number of workforce
fell modestly. Backlogs of work decreased as new order inflows
contracted.

Business optimism improved in December and the degree of confidence rose
to the strongest since February.

"Although signaling slightly brighter [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) at the end of 2020, December
data still painted the picture of a challenging landscape for Greek
manufacturers as we head into 2021," Sian Jones, economist at IHS
Markit, said.
