Poland's manufacturing activity rose more than expected in December,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 51.7 in
December.

Economists had forecast a reading of 51.5. Any reading above 50.0
indicates expansion in the sector.

New orders increased for the first time since September. New work rose
in December, while output contracted for the second straight month.

Employment decreased in December and suppliers' delivery time
lengthened. Backlogs of work rose for the third month in a row.

Stocks of inputs expanded at the fastest rate in the twenty-two years
survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Input price inflation rose sharply to the highest since April 2011 and
output prices increased.

Confidence of higher output increased over the next 12 months in
December. Sentiment was the strongest since May 2018.
