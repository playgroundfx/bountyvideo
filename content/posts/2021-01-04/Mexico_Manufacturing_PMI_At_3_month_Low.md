Mexico's manufacturing sector contraction deepened in December amid
limited demand, job cuts and decline in output, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Monday.

The purchasing manager's index for the manufacturing sector dropped to a
three-month low of 42.4 from 43.7 in November. A reading below 50
signals decline in activity in the sector.

"With domestic issues exacerbated by the pandemic, monthly rates of
reduction in December for output, new orders and employment were all
among the sharpest seen since data collection started in April 2011,"
Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.

Meanwhile, firms turned optimistic regarding the growth outlook on
expectations that the Covid-19 pandemic could subside as several
countries across the world have started vaccination against the
[coronavirus][1].

IHS Markit forecast 3.7 percent growth in Mexico's output this year. The
research firm also expects an upward revision should there be favorable
negotiations between Mexico and the US once the new US administration
takes over, De Lima said.
