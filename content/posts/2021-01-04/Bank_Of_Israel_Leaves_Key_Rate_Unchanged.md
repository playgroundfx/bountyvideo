Israel's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Monday,
and said it will expand the use of its existing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools and also
launch new ones.

The Monetary Committee decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at
0.1 percent, the Bank of Israel said in a statement. The previous change
in the interest rate was a 15 basis points reduction in April last year.

The central bank noted that the fast pace of the inoculation process
against the [coronavirus][1] in Israel increases the optimism regarding
a rapid return of the [economy][2] to a path of growth in the coming
year.

But, the risks to economic activity remain high, and the adverse impact
on the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be
prolonged, the bank added.

"The Committee will therefore continue to utilize a range of tools in
order to increase the extent of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation and to
ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial [markets][3],"
the BoI said.

"The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, including the
interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that
it assesses that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
goals and to moderate the adverse economic impact resulting from the
crisis."

Under a rapid vaccination scenario, the central bank projected GDP
growth at 6.3 percent next year and 5.8 percent in the year after. In a
slow vaccination scenario, economic growth would be 3.5 percent this
year and 6.0 percent next year.

"In view of the fast pace of inoculations so far, it seems that the
rapid inoculation scenario is more likely to come about than the slow
inoculation scenario," the bank said.  
  
The BoI Research Department also projected the interest rate to remain
very low at 0-0.1 percent, and forecast that the bank will continue to
enhance the extent of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation as needed.

The central bank expects the appreciation of the shekel to have some
impact on exports going forward and the continued strengthening to lead
to a further slowing of inflation.
