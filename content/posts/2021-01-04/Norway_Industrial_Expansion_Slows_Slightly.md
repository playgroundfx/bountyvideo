Norway's manufacturing sector growth remained broadly unchanged in
December, defying expectations for a modest improvement, survey data
from the logistics association NIMA showed on Monday.

The DNB/NIMA purchasing manager's index for the manufacturing sector
dropped to 51.9 from 52.0 in November. Economists had expected the index
to climb to 52.3.

A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector.

The underlying trend remained positive, NIMA said.

That said, the sub-indexes for new orders and production declined
sharply in December. The index for employment increased.
