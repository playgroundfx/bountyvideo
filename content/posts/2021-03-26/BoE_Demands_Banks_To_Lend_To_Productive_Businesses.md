The Bank of England urged banks to support the [economy][1] by lending
to productive businesses as the Covid-19 continued to pose challenges
for both households and businesses.

According to the summary of the Financial Policy Committee meeting, the
UK banking system is resilient to keep supporting households and
businesses.

Banks have more capacity to lend as the BoE reduced the cushion of
capital that banks need to hold to absorb potential losses.

The FPC observed that businesses will need more support in the months
ahead even as the UK economy recovers.

Further, the FPC said it remained committed to working with EU
authorities towards a safe and open financial system. Close cooperation
between regulatory authorities is essential to manage financial
stability risks.
