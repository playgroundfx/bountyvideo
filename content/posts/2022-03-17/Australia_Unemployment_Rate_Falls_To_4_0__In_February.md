The jobless rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 4.0
percent in February, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Thursday.

That was below expectations for 4.1 percent and down from 4.2 percent in
January.

The Australian [economy][1] added 77,400 jobs last month, blowing away
forecasts for an increase of 37,000 jobs following the gain of 12,900
jobs in the previous month.

The participation rate came in at 66.4 percent, exceeding expectations
for 66.3 percent and up from 66.2 percent a month earlier.
