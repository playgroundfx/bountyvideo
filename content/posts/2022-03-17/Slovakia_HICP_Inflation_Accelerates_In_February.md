Slovakia's EU measure of inflation increased sharply in February, data
from the Statistical Office Of the Slovak Republic showed on Thursday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, increased 8.3 percent
year-on-year in February, following a 7.7 percent growth in January.
Economists had expected a 8.2 percent rise.

On a month-on-month basis, the HICP increased 0.8 percent in February,
after a 2.8 percent rise in the preceding month. This was in line with
initial estimate.

Earlier, the statistical office reported that the consumer price index
rose 9.0 percent yearly in February and gained 0.9 percent from a month
ago.

The core inflation rose to 7.9 percent in February from 7.1 percent in
the prior month.
