Europe passenger car sales declined again in February as the
manufacturers continued to face supply chain disruptions, data from the
European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) showed on
Thursday.

Passenger car sales fell 6.7 percent year-on-year in February, faster
than the 6.0 percent decrease in January.

With 719,465 units sold across the EU, this was the weakest result in
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of volumes for the month of February since records began, the ACEA
said.

The four major car [markets][1] posted mixed results in February. Car
registrations in Italy logged a double-digit fall of 22.6 percent and
that in France decreased 13.0 percent.

Meanwhile, car sales in Spain and Germany expanded 6.6 percent and 3.2
percent, respectively.

During January to February period, car registrations declined 6.4
percent from the same period last year.
