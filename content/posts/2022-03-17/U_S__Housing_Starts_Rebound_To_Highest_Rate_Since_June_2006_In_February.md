After reporting a sharp pullback in new residential construction in the
U.S. in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a report on
Thursday showing housing starts rebounded by much more than expected in
the month of February.

The report showed housing starts spiked by 6.8 percent to an annual rate
of 1.769 million in February after plunging by 5.5 percent to a revised
rate of 1.657 million in January.

Economists had expected housing starts to jump by 3.2 percent to a rate
of 1.690 million from the 1.638 million originally reported for the
previous month.

With the much bigger than expected increase, housing starts reached
their highest annual rate since hitting 1.802 million in June of 2006.

Single-family housing starts surged by 5.7 percent to an annual rate of
1.215 million, while multi-family housing starts soared by 9.3 percent
to a rate of 554,000.

Meanwhile, the report showed building permits slumped by 1.9 percent to
an annual rate of 1.859 million in February after rising by 0.5 percent
to a revised rate of 1.895 million in January.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, had been
expected to tumble by 2.6 percent to a rate of 1.850 million from the
1.899 million originally reported for the previous month.

The sizable pullback came after building permits reached their highest
annual rate since May of 2006 in January.

Single-family permits edged down by 0.5 percent to a rate of 1.207
million, while multi-family permits plunged by 4.4 percent to a rate of
652,000.

"Strong demand, sparse inventory, relatively upbeat homebuilder
sentiment and a large backlog of starts - which were at a record level
in February - should support new home construction this year," said
Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Still, housing starts are likely to lose some momentum over
the course of the year, with higher interest rates and elevated
construction costs weighing on activity."

On Wednesday, the National Association of Home Builders released a
separate report showing a bigger than expected decrease in U.S.
homebuilder confidence in the month of March.

The report showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to
79 in March from a downwardly revised 81 in February. Economists had
expected the index to edge down to 81 from the 82 originally reported
for the previous month.

The NAHB noted the index dropped below 80 for the first time since last
September as increasing development and construction costs have taken a
toll on builder confidence even as buyer demand remains relatively
solid.
