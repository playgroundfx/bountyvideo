The Bank of England raised its key rate for a third [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting in a
row as inflation is forecast to climb even higher after the Russia's
invasion of Ukraine.  
  
Policymakers led by Governor Andrew Bailey decided to raise the key
interest rate, the bank rate, by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent.

The Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 to hike the
rate by 0.25 percentage points. Policymaker Jon Cunliffe preferred to
maintain the rate at 0.5 percent.

The UK central bank had raised its rate by 0.15 percentage points at its
December meeting and by 0.25 percentage point in February.

Given the current tightness of the labor market, continuing signs of
robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those
pressures would persist, most MPC members judged that a quarter-point
rate hike was warranted at this meeting, the bank said.

"The Committee judges that some further modest tightening in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) may be appropriate in the coming months, but there are risks on
both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects for
inflation evolve," the bank said.

The announcement came after the U.S. Federal Reserve had raised its key
rate for the first time since 2018, on Wednesday.

Global inflationary pressures will strengthen considerably further over
coming months, while growth in economies that are net energy importers,
including the United Kingdom, is likely to slow, the BoE said.

The bank said the effects of Russia-Ukraine war would likely accentuate
both the peak in inflation and the adverse impact on activity by
intensifying the squeeze on household incomes.

Inflation was expected to rise to around 6 percent in February and
March, before rising further, to around 8 percent in April, and
remaining close to that rate for the rest of the quarter. The latter
would be around 1 percentage point higher than expected in the February
Report.

Inflation is set to be higher than the bank expects and, activity and
the labor market will be a bit more resilient, Paul Dales at Capital
Economics, said. The MPC is likely to change its tune and raise interest
rates to 1.25 percent this year and to 2.00 percent next year, the
economist added.

Regarding future moves, a fourth hike is possible in May but there is a
good chance of a pause after that, economists at ING said.

The BoE forecast the UK GDP to grow by around 0.75 percent in the first
quarter of 2022, which was stronger than the February Report projection
for a flat quarterly out-turn. This now-cast assumed that some of the
surprising strength in non-Covid related activity in recent months
persisted through the quarter.
