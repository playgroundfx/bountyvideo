Austria's consumer price inflation increased as initially estimated in
February, to the highest since August 1984, final data from Statistics
Austria showed on Thursday.

Consumer prices rose 5.9 percent yearly in February, following a 5.0
percent increase in January, as initially estimated.

"Strong price drivers are the persistently high fuel prices and
household energy, where prices are spiraling upwards," Tobias Thomas,
director general at Statistics Austria, said.

"Without the price increases in this area, the inflation rate would have
been 3.8 percent."

Prices for housing, water and energy grew 7.7 percent annually in
February and those of restaurant and hotels increased 6.7 percent.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages and those of leisure and
culture gained by 4.3 percent, each. Prices for clothing and shoes
increased 5.8 percent.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 5.5
percent annually in February, following a 4.5 percent increase in the
preceding month, as estimated.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices increased 1.3 percent monthly in
February, in line with the initial estimate.

On month-on-month basis, the HICP rose 1.3 percent in February, as
initially estimated.
