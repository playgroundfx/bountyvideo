The Bank of England is expected to raise its key rate for the third
straight meeting on Thursday, as inflation is likely to accelerate more
than anticipated due to higher energy prices amid the war in Ukraine.

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement and the minutes of the meeting from the
BoE are due at 8.00 am ET. Markets expect the bank to lift its key rate
by a quarter-point to 0.75 percent from 0.50 percent.

Other statistical reports due for the day are as follows:

At 3.00 am ET, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or
ACEA, releases Europe's new car registrations for February. Passenger
car sales had fallen 6.0 percent to reach 682,596 units in January.

At 4.00 am ET, harmonized inflation figures are due from Austria and
Slovakia.

At 6.00 am ET, Eurostat releases euro area final inflation data for
February. According to flash estimate, inflation advanced to a fresh 5.8
percent from 5.1 percent in January. The statistical office is expected
to confirm the flash estimate.

At 7.00 am ET, Turkey's central bank announces the outcome of its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting. Economists expect the bank to hold its one-week
repo rate at 14.00 percent.
