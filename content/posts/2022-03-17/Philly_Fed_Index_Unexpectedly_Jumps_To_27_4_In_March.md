A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed an unexpected acceleration in the pace of growth in
regional manufacturing activity in the month of March.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity jumped to
27.4 in March from 16.0 in February, with a positive reading indicating
growth in regional manufacturing activity. The increase surprised
economists, who had expected the index to edge down to 15.0.

Looking ahead, firms remained generally optimistic about growth over the
next six months, although the diffusion index for future general
activity fell to 22.7 in March from 28.1 in February.
