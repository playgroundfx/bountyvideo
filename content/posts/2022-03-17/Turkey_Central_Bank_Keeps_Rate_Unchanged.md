Turkey's central bank retained its key interest rate for the third
straight meeting despite continuous surge in inflation.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to hold the one-week repo
rate at 14.00 percent.

Under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, the bank had lowered the
rate by 500 basis points since last September.

"The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of
measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and
financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the
base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict," the
bank said in the statement.

The further worsening of the inflation picture and downward pressure on
the lira were, once again, not enough to persuade Turkey's central bank
to raise the one-week repo rate from 14.00 percent, Jason Tuvey, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

The economist expects [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings to be left unchanged over the
coming months. Barring another collapse in the lira, inflation will drop
sharply at the very end of this year and that may trigger another
interest rate cut, Tuvey added.
