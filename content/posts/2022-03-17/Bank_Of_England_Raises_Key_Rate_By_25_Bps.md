The Bank of England raised its key rate for the third straight meeting
as inflation outlook worsened after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Policymakers led by Governor Andrew Bailey decided to increase the key
interest by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent.

The Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 to hike the
Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points. One member preferred to maintain
the rate at 0.5 percent.

The bank had raised its rate by 0.15 percentage points at its December
meeting and by 0.25 percentage point in February.

"The Committee judges that some further modest tightening in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) may be appropriate in the coming months, but there are risks on
both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects for
inflation evolve," the bank said.

GDP is forecast to grow by around 0.75 percent in the first quarter of
2022, stronger than the February Report projection for a flat quarterly
outturn.

The BoE expects inflation to rise further in coming months, to around 8
percent in the second quarter of 2022, and perhaps even higher later
this year.

The bank said the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine would likely
accentuate both the peak in inflation and the adverse impact on activity
by intensifying the squeeze on household incomes.
