Hong Kong's unemployment rate increased to a five-month high during the
December to February period after remaining unchanged in the previous
period, the labor force statistics from the Census and Statistics
Department showed on Thursday.

The unemployment rate rose a seasonally adjusted 4.5 percent in the
three months to February from 3.9 percent during November-January
period.

The latest rate was the highest since the July-September period of last
year, when it was at the same level.

The underemployment rate increased to 2.3 percent from 1.8 percent in
the preceding period.

The number of unemployed persons increased by around 22,700 to 157,900
in December-February. Over the same period, the number of underemployed
persons also rose, around 17,100 to 86,900.

Total employment decreased about 33,700 to 3.643 million in the three
months to February.

"The labor market will continue to face pressure in the near term, as
the acute local epidemic is weighing heavily on consumption-related
activities and causing disruptions to a wide range of economic
activities," the Secretary for Labor and Welfare, Law Chi-kwong, said.
