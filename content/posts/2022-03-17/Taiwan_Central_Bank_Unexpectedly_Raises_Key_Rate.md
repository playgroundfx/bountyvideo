Taiwan's central bank raised its key interest rate unexpectedly amid
worries about inflation.

At the quarterly meeting, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers of the central bank lifted its
benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 1.375 percent from 1.125 percent.
The interest rate has been at a record low 1.125 percent since March
2020.

The central bank said the global supply chain bottleneck will continue
for some time, and the recent military conflict between Russia and
Ukraine has caused the prices of crude oil, grains and base metals to
rise.

Inflation for the whole year of 2022 is seen at 2.37 percent, up from
the previous outlook of 1.59 percent.

Due to the impact of the war in Ukraine, the bank expects economic
growth to moderate this year despite a pick-up in private consumption
and exports.

The headline inflation rate is set to peak at around 4.0 percent in the
second quarter of the year, before dropping back in the second half of
the year, Gareth Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

"We doubt today's 25bp rate hike is the start of an aggressive
tightening cycle. We are expecting just 25bps more of rate hikes this
year," Leather added.
