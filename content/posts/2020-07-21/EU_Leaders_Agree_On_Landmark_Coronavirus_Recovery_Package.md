EU leaders agreed on a EUR 1.8 trillion package of measures to tackle
the exceptional nature of the economic and social situation posed by the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

After four days of marathon talks in Brussels, EU leaders conceded the
package worth EUR 750 billion. Accordingly, the bloc will issue debt
jointly which would be provided to member nations hit hardest by the
Covid-19.

Out of the EUR 750 billion recovery plan, EUR 390 billion will be in the
form of grants and EUR 360 billion of low interest rate loans. Now the
deal needs to be approved by the parliament of 27 member states.

According to the original plan, EUR 500 billion was allocated for grants
and EUR 250 billion in loans.

But the four frugal members, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Sweden opposed providing EUR 500 billion in the form of grants.

Earlier in May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Emmanuel Macron had drafted an outline of today's package, which was
finally approved with amendments.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that it was a "historic
day for Europe."

Alongside, members also agreed on the regular budget for the next seven
years. The budget worth about EUR 1.1 trillion was designed to fund EU's
regular policies.

The European Council said the latest package includes Multiannual
Financial Framework, or MFF, and a specific Recovery effort under Next
Generation EU, or NGEU.

"It is an ambitious and comprehensive package combining the classical
MFF with an extraordinary Recovery effort destined to tackle the effects
of an unprecedented crisis in the best interest of the EU," the European
Council said.

"NGEU and MFF go together," the council added. The NGEU is an
exceptional response to those temporary but extreme circumstances.

ING economists said the agreement is a milestone for the EU as it tries
to battle the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. However, in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
of size, the fund is still relatively small given the severity of the
economic crisis.

Also, the fund will only become effective on January 1, with the first
money probably reaching the real [economy][2] not much before mid-2021,
they pointed out.

This was the second longest summit in the EU [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) after the Nice
summit in 2000. The summit that began last Friday was initially planned
to end on Saturday. But the failure to reach on a deal forced leaders to
extend the meeting.
