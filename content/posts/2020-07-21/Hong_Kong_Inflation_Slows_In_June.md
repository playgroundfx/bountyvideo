Hong Kong's consumer price inflation eased for the third month in a row
in June, data from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 0.7 percent year-on-year in June, after a
1.5 percent increase in May.

The smaller annual increase in June inflation was mainly due to the
moderation of the year-on-year increases in the prices of pork when
compared with May, the agency said.

Excluding the effects of all government's one-off relief measures, core
inflation was 1.2 percent in June, after a 1.9 percent rise in the
previous month.

"The underlying consumer price inflation rate eased visibly to 1.2
percent in June, as prices of basic foodstuffs showed a much narrower
year-on-year increase against a high base of comparison caused by the
surge in pork prices which started in May last year," a government
spokesman said.

"Looking ahead, overall inflationary pressures will likely recede
further in the near term amid austere global and local economic
conditions."
