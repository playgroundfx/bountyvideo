The Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing a modest
decrease in new orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods in the month
of July.

The report said durable goods orders edged down by 0.1 percent in July
following a 0.8 percent increase in June. Economists had expected orders
to decrease by 0.3 percent.

The dip in durable goods orders came as orders for transportation
equipment tumbled by 2.2 percent in July after jumping by 1.4 percent in
the previous month.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts led the way lower, plummeting
by 48.9 percent in July after surging by 4.7 percent in June.

Excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods
orders climbed by 0.7 percent in July after rising by 0.6 percent in
June. Ex-transportation orders were expected to increase by 0.5 percent.

Notable increases in orders for primary metals and machinery were partly
offset by a slump in orders for electrical equipment, appliances and
components.

The report said new orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a closely watched indicator of [business][1] spending, came in
unchanged in July after jumping by 1.0 percent in June.
