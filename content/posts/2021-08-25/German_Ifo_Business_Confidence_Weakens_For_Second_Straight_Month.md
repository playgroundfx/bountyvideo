German [business][1] confidence weakened for the second straight month
in August mainly due to significantly less optimism in companies'
expectations, survey results from ifo Institute showed on Wednesday.

The business climate index fell to 99.4 in August from 100.7 in July.
The score was expected to ease moderately to 100.4.

Expectations among companies deteriorated to a six-month low in August.
By contrast, companies assessed their current situation as somewhat
better than in the previous month.

The current situation indicator advanced to 101.4 from 100.4 in the
previous month. The expected level was 100.8.

On the other hand, the expectations index declined to 97.5 in August
from 101.0 a month ago and also remained below economists' forecast of
100.0.

Supply bottlenecks for intermediate products in manufacturing and
worries about rising infection numbers are putting a strain on the
[economy][2], Clemens Fuest, ifo President said.

The second successive decline in the confidence index provides further
evidence that Germany's recovery is losing some momentum, partly due to
supply chain difficulties in the manufacturing sector and the Delta
variant, Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

That said, GDP should still increase sharply in the third quarter, the
economist said.

In manufacturing, the business climate weakened notably in August.
Assessments of the current situation declined but stayed in positive
territory. Meanwhile, the outlook for the coming months, took a clear
dip, as the expectations indicator fell to its lowest level since
November 2020.

The business climate indicator in the service sector also dropped in
August. The optimism with regard to future business development has
faded. However, companies still assessed their current situation as much
better than in July.

The sentiment index fell in trade also. Companies were less satisfied
with their current business situation, and their expectations also
turned more pessimistic.

However, in construction, the business climate index rose from July.
Companies were somewhat more satisfied with their current business, and
their expectations were also much brighter.
