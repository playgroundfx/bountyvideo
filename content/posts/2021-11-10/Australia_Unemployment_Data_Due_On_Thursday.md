Australia is on Thursday scheduled to release October figures for
unemployment, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

The jobless rate is expected to rise to 4.8 percent from 4.6 percent in
September, while the Australian [economy][1] is tipped to have added
50,000 jobs following the loss of 138,000 in the previous month. The
participation rate is expected to creep up to 64.9 percent from 64.5
percent a month earlier.

Japan will provide October figures for producer prices, with forecasts
suggesting an increase of 0.4 percent on month and 7.0 percent on year -
up from 0.3 percent on month and 6.3 percent on year in September.
