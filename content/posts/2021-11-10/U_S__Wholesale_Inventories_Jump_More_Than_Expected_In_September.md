A report released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed
wholesale inventories in the U.S. jumped by more than expected in the
month of September.

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories surged up by 1.4
percent in September after leaping by 1.3 percent in August. Economists
had expected inventories to jump by 1.0 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in wholesale inventories came as
inventories of durable goods and non-durable goods shot up by 1.3
percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.

The report also showed a notable rebound in wholesale sales, which
jumped by 1.1 percent in September after slumping by 0.9 percent in
August.

Sales of non-durable goods spiked by 2.2 percent during the month, more
than offsetting a 0.2 percent dip in sales of durable goods.

With inventories and sales both showing significant increases, the
inventories/sales ratio for merchant wholesalers was unchanged from the
previous month at 1.23.
