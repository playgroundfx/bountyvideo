The Labor Department released a highly anticipated report on Wednesday
showing U.S. consumer prices increased by more than expected in the
month of October.

The report said the consumer price index jumped by 0.9 percent in
October after rising by 0.4 percent in September. Economists had
expected consumer prices to climb by 0.6 percent.

Excluding higher prices for food and energy, core consumer prices still
increased by 0.6 percent in October after inching up by 0.2 percent in
September. Core prices were expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

The Labor Department also said the annual rate of growth in consumer
prices accelerated to 6.2 percent in October from 5.4 percent in
September, reaching the highest level since November of 1990.

The annual rate of growth in core prices also accelerated to 4.6 percent
from 4.0 percent, reflecting the biggest jump in prices since August of
1991.
