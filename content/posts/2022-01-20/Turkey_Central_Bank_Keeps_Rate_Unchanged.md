Turkey's central bank kept its interest rates unchanged on Thursday,
after slashing it for four straight months.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to hold the one-week repo
rate at 14.00 percent.

Under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, the bank had lowered the
rate by 500 basis points since September.

While cumulative impact of the recent [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions is being
monitored, to create a foundation for sustainable price stability, the
comprehensive review of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework is being conducted with the
aim of prioritizing Turkish lira in all [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools of the CBRT, the
bank said.

The MPC said it expects disinflation process to start on the back of
measures taken for sustainable price and financial stability along with
the decline in inflation owing to the base effect.

Even though inflation is likely to breach 40 percent in the coming
months, President Erdogan is unlikely to permit interest rate hikes,
Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

It is more likely that further easing will be delivered later this year,
the economist added.
