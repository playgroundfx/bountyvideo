The Netherlands' fixed asset investments grew in November after falling
in the previous month, preliminary data from the Central Bureau of
Statistics showed Thursday.

The volume of investments in tangible fixed assets grew 1.9 percent
year-on-year following a 2.2 percent fall in the previous month.

The pace of growth was the strongest since July.

Investments in homes and buildings in particular were higher than one
year previously while the outlay for passenger cars and infrastructure
decreased.

Compared to November 2019, investments lower by more than 1 percent.

The conditions for investments are less favorable in January than in
November, mainly because consumer confidence fell and the year-on-year
rise in the stock market value was smaller, the CBS said. Meanwhile,
exports grew faster.
