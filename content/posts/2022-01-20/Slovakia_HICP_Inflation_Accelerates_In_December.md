Slovakia's EU measure of inflation rose in December, data from the
Statistical Office Of the Slovak Republic showed on Thursday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, increased 5.1 percent
year-on-year in December, following a 4.8 percent growth in November.
This was in line with economists' expectation.

On a month-on-month basis, the HICP increased 0.2 percent in December,
after a 0.5 percent rise in the preceding month. This was in line with
economists' forecast.

In 2021, the average HICP inflation was 2.8 percent.

Earlier, the statistical office reported that the consumer price index
rose 5.8 percent yearly in December and grew 0.2 percent from a month
ago.

The core inflation rose to 6.3 percent in December from 4.8 percent in
the prior month.
