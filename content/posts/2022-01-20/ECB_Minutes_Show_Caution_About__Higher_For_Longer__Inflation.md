European Central Bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers retained the view that the current
spike in inflation is being driven by temporary factors that are likely
to ease in the course of this year, but some expressed concern that
inflation could remain elevated, the minutes of the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
session showed Thursday.

"The projected convergence of inflation expectations towards 2 percent
was to be welcomed although the outlook was surrounded by exceptionally
high uncertainty," the minutes, which the ECB calls "account", of the
December 15-16 Governing Council session showed.

"At the same time, it was cautioned that a "higher for longer" inflation
scenario could not be ruled out."

Policymakers also expressed concerns about any premature scaling back of
monetary stimulus and asset purchases.

An argument was put forward that [markets][1] seemed to question the
credibility of the ECB's forward guidance, as they expected a first
interest rate increase at a date that was difficult to reconcile with
the conditions set by the Governing Council for such an increase.

Members widely agreed that substantial monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support was still
needed for inflation to stabilize at the Governing Council's inflation
target over the medium term, the minutes said.

Meanwhile, some argued that there was no need for a further loosening of
the stance through additional asset purchases, given the measurable
progress made in the convergence of medium-term inflation towards the
target.  
  
"All in all, the minutes of the ECB's December meeting illustrate a more
realistic debate on the several inflation scenarios, supporting the
decision to scale back asset purchases in 2022," ING economist Carsten
Brzeski said.

The economist said the ECB's gradual normalization would start with the
current gradual reduction of asset purchases, and continue with an end
to net purchases towards the end of 2022 and a first rate hike in early
2023.

In an interview to the France Inter Radio earlier on Thursday, ECB
President Christine Lagarde rejected calls for a quicker rate hike
citing the risk of hurting economic growth.
