Norway's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Thursday
and reiterated that the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised in March.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee of Norges Bank
unanimously decided to hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 0.50 percent. The bank
had raised its rate by a quarter-point in December.

"Based on the Committee's current assessment of the outlook and balance
of risks, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised in March," Governor
Ã˜ystein Olsen, said.

The governor said monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is expansionary. In the Committee's
assessment, the objective of stabilizing inflation around the target
somewhat further out suggests that the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate should be raised
towards a more normal level.

Whereas the Bank's plans to tighten [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) were originally motivated by
financial stability risks, consumer price pressures are a growing
concern and reinforce the case for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening, Andrew Kenningham,
an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The Norges Bank will raise rates four times this year, bringing them to
1.5 percent, which is a little more than is currently priced into
financial [markets][1], the economist added.
