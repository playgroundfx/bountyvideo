Germany's producer prices grew at the strongest pace since the series
began in 1949, driven by higher energy prices, Destatis reported
Thursday.

Producer prices grew 24.2 percent year-on-year in December, after rising
19.2 percent in November. This was the strongest year-on-year increase
since the survey began in 1949 and also exceeded the economists'
forecast of 19.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer price inflation advanced to 5.0 percent
from 0.8 percent in November. Economists had forecast prices to climb
again by 0.8 percent.

Data showed that energy prices surged 69.0 percent from the same period
last year. At the same time, intermediate goods prices were up 19.3
percent.

Excluding energy, producer prices were up 10.4 percent in December, data
showed.  
  
In 2021, producer prices increased 10.5 percent compared to a decline of
1.0 percent in 2020.
