Japan posted a merchandise trade deficit of 582.2 billion yen in
December, the Ministry of Finance said on Thursday.

That beat forecasts for a shortfall of 784.1 billion yen following the
downwardly revised deficit of 955.6 billion yen in November (originally
-954.8 billion yen).

Exports climbed 17.5 percent on year, exceeding expectations for a gain
of 16.0 percent following the 20.5 percent increase in the previous
month.

Imports were up 41.1 percent on year versus expectations for 42.8
percent and down from 43.8 percent a month earlier.

For all of 2021, imports rose 24.3 percent and exports gained 21.5
percent for a trade deficit of 1.472 trillion yen.
