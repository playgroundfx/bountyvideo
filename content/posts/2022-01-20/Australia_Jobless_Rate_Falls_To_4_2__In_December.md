The unemployment rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 4.2
percent in December, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Thursday - beating handily expectations for 4.5 percent and down from
4.6 percent in November.

The Australian [economy][1] added 64,800 jobs last month, blowing away
forecasts for an increase of 43,300 following the addition of 366,100 in
November.

Full-time employment increased by 41,500 jobs, while part-time was up
23,300 jobs.

The participation rate was 66.1 percent - unchanged from the previous
month but shy of expectations for 66.2 percent.
