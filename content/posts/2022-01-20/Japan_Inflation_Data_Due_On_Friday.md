Japan will on Friday release December data for consumer prices,
highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. In
November, inflation was up 0.3 percent on month and 0.6 percent on year,
while core CPI was up an annual 0.5 percent.

Also, the Bank of Japan will release the minutes from its monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on December 16 and 17. At the meeting, the BoJ decided to
scale back its pandemic related funding measures - ending the additional
purchases of CP and corporate bonds at the end of March 2022 as
scheduled. The board decided to maintain the interest rate at -0.1
percent on current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the
central bank.

Thailand will provide December data for imports, exports and trade
balance. Imports are tipped to rise 18.0 percent on year, down from 20.5
percent in November. Exports are called higher by an annual 15.0
percent, slowing from 24.7 percent in the previous month. The trade
surplus is pegged at $0.47 billion, down from $1.02 billion a month
earlier.

Australia will see December figures for new home sales from the Housing
Industry Association; in November, sales jumped 7.7 percent on month.
