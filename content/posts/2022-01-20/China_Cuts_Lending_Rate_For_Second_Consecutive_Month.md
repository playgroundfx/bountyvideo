China reduced its benchmark lending rate for the second straight month
as the economic growth weakened at the end of 2021.

The one-year loan prime rate was reduced to 3.70 percent from 3.80
percent. This was the second consecutive reduction after a 5 basis point
cut in December.

The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage rates, was lowered to 4.60
percent from 4.65 percent, which was the first cut since April 2020.

Mortgages will now be slightly cheaper which should help shore up
housing demand, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at
Capital Economics, said.

Economists expect additional easing to follow in the coming months,
including measures to push down deposit rates. But [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers still
appear reluctant to engineer a sharp pick-up in credit growth, they
added.

The loan prime rate is fixed monthly based on the submission of 18
banks, though Beijing has influence over the rate-setting. This lending
rate replaced the central bank's traditional benchmark lending rate in
August 2019.

Early this week, the People's Bank of China had cut the one-year medium
lending facility rate to 2.85 percent from 2.95 percent and the 7-day
reverse repo rate to 2.10 percent from 2.20 percent.

Iris Pang, an economist at ING said all these actions are proactive to
support economic growth. The question remains whether banks will respond
by increasing lending

The current credit environment is not improving. She said the
uncertainty of credit from real estate developers has led to a general
atmosphere that credit quality is worse now than in 2020. Banks will be
picky about who they lend to and may require more collateral, Pang
noted.
