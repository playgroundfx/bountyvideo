Indonesia's central bank on Thursday left its key interest rate
unchanged again in a bid to support the economic recovery.

The Board of Governors decided to maintain the seven-day reverse repo
rate at 3.50 percent, the Bank Indonesia said. The previous change in
the rate was a quarter-point reduction in February 2020.  
  
"The decision is consistent with the need to maintain inflation,
exchange rate and financial system stability for economic growth amid a
build-up of external pressure," the bank said.

The bank also announced plans to raise the rupiah reserve requirement
for various banks in a staggered manner.  
  
The bank expects the [economy][1] to grow 4.7-5.5 percent this year
after an estimated 3.2-4.0 percent expansion in 2021. Growth is expected
to pick up this year on the back of stronger private consumption and
investment.  
  
Inflation remain low, below the the 3.0Â±1 percent target, in 2021. The
central bank expects inflation to remain within the target range this
year amid sufficient supply to meet growing demand, anchored inflation
expectations and exchange rate stability.
