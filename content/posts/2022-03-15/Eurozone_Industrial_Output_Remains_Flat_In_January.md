Eurozone industrial production remained unchanged in January, data from
Eurostat showed on Tuesday.

Industrial output remained flat month-on-month in January, following
December's 1.3 percent increase. Economists had forecast a monthly
growth of 0.1 percent.

The growth in non-durable consumer goods production was offset by the
declines in capital goods, durable consumer goods, energy and
intermediate goods output.

Production of capital goods was down 2.4 percent and durable consumer
goods output fell 0.5 percent. Intermediate goods and energy output
decreased 0.3 percent each. Meanwhile, non-durable consumer goods output
grew 3.1 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial production fell 1.3 percent, in contrast
to the 2.0 percent rise in December. Economists had forecast output to
fall 0.5 percent.

Industrial production in the EU27 gained 0.4 percent both on a monthly
and annual basis in January.
