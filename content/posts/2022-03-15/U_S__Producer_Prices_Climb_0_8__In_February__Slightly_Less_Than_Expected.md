A report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed producer
prices in the U.S. increased by slightly less than expected in the month
of February.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
climbed by 0.8 percent in February after surging by an upwardly revised
1.2 percent in January.

Economists had expected producer prices to advance by 0.9 percent
compared to the 1.0 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

Compared to the same month a year ago, producer prices were up by a
record 10.0 percent in February, unchanged from a revised 10.0 percent
spike in January.

"Inflation in the pipeline is showing few signs of decelerating in the
near term, especially as the Russia-Ukraine war wreaks havoc in energy
and other commodity [markets][1]," said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

He added, "Higher input costs will keep producer prices frustratingly
elevated and continue to squeeze profit margins, likely feeding higher
consumer prices in the coming months until war tensions unwind and goods
demand moderates."

Energy prices helped lead the monthly increase in producer prices,
soaring by 8.2 percent in February after surging by 3.7 percent in
January.

The report also showed another jump in food prices, which shot up by 1.9
percent in February after leaping by 1.7 percent in January.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said service prices were unchanged in
February after advancing by 1.0 percent in the previous month.

A 1.9 percent surge in prices for transportation and warehousing
services and a 0.2 percent uptick in prices for trade services were
offset by a 0.4 percent drop in prices for other services.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices edged up by 0.2 percent in February following a 0.8 percent
increase in January.

The report showed the annual rate of growth in core prices slowed to 6.6
percent in February from 6.8 percent in January.

Last Thursday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing a
continued acceleration in the annual rate of U.S. consumer price growth
in the month of February.

The report showed the annual rate of consumer price growth accelerated
to 7.9 percent in February from 7.5 percent in January, reaching the
highest rate since January 1982.

The faster year-over-year price growth came as consumer prices climbed
by 0.8 percent in February after rising by 0.6 percent in January. The
increase in prices matched economist estimates.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices rose by 0.5
percent in February following a 0.6 percent increase in January. The
core price growth also matched expectations.

The annual rate of core consumer price growth accelerated to 6.4 percent
in February from 6.0 percent in January, showing the fastest growth
since August 1982.
