New York manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in the month of
March, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York on Tuesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index tumbled
to a negative 11.8 in March from a positive 3.1 in February, with a
negative reading indicating a contraction in regional manufacturing
activity. Economists had expected the index to dip to a positive 7.0.

With the much bigger than expected decrease, the general business
conditions index dropped to its lowest level since May 2020.

The decline by the headline index came as the new orders index slumped
to a negative 11.2 in March from a positive 1.4 in February and the
shipments index slid to a negative 7.4 in March from a positive 2.9 in
February.

The number of employees index also fell to 14.5 in March from 23.1 in
February, indicating a slowdown in the pace of job growth.

Meanwhile, the New York Fed noted delivery times continued to lengthen
substantially, with the delivery time index jumping to 32.7 in March
from 21.6 in February.

The report also showed the prices paid index dipped to 73.8 in March
from 76.6 in February, while the prices received index rose to 56.1 from
54.1.

Looking ahead, the index for future business conditions climbed to 36.6
in March from 28.2 in February, as firms were generally optimistic about
the six-month outlook.

The New York Fed said longer delivery times, higher prices, and
increases in employment are all expected in the months ahead, while
capital spending plans remained firm.

"Much improved [health][2] conditions and the removal of most pandemic
restrictions will fuel a strong revival for in-person services, but
there's still plenty of goods demand to keep manufacturing growing at a
hearty pace," said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

"In fact, supply will be manufacturing's main problem in 2022," he
added. "The war in Ukraine and the worst outbreak of Covid in China
since March 2020 will worsen logistics bottlenecks and stoke more
inflationary pressures, aggravating already severe stress in supply
chains."

On Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is scheduled to release
its report on regional manufacturing activity. The Philly Fed Index is
expected to edge down to 15.0 in March from 16.0 in February.
