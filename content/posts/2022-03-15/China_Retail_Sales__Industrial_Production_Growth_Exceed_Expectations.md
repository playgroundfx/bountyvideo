China's retail sales and industrial production as well as fixed asset
investment grew more than expected during the January to February
period, signaling a strong start to the year.

Retail sales advanced 6.7 percent on a yearly basis in January to
February period, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on
Tuesday. This was bigger than the economists' forecast of 3.0 percent
but the pace of growth slowed from 12.5 percent expansion seen in
December.

Industrial output logged an annual growth of 7.5 percent, which was also
much better than the 3.9 percent rise expected by economists.

The statistics bureau combines the data for January and February to
avoid the distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday.

Fixed asset investment advanced 12.2 percent from the last year versus
the expected growth of 5.0 percent.

The urban unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent in February. Economists
had forecast the rate to remain unchanged at 5.1 percent.

"All three activity data releases were better than expectations, but the
highlight for us was the strength of retail sales," Iris Pang, an ING
economist, said. This is even more notable during a period of strict
people flow control during the Chinese New Year holidays.

This better-than-expected [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has enabled the People's Bank of China to
hold [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates steady.

Although activity data was stronger than anticipated, the [economy][1]
looks set to come under renewed pressure over the coming months amid
China's worst COVID-19 outbreak since Wuhan, Julian Evans-Pritchard and
Sheana Yue, economists at Capital Economics, said.

As such, it is only a matter of time before the PBoC resumes its rate
cuts, they noted.

Earlier in the day, the central bank had kept the rate on its one-year
medium-term lending facility unchanged at 2.85 percent. The bank
injected a net CNY 100 billion into the banking system.
