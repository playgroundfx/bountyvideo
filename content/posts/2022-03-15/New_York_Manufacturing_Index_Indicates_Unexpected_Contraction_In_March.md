New York manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in the month of
March, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York on Tuesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index tumbled
to a negative 11.8 in March from a positive 3.1 in February, with a
negative reading indicating a contraction in regional manufacturing
activity. Economists had expected the index to dip to a positive 7.0.

With the much bigger than expected decrease, the general business
conditions index dropped to its lowest level since May 2020.
