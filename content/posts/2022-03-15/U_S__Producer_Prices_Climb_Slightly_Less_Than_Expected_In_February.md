A report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed producer
prices in the U.S. increased by slightly less than expected in the month
of February.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
climbed by 0.8 percent in February after surging by an upwardly revised
1.2 percent in January.

Economists had expected producer prices to advance by 0.9 percent
compared to the 1.0 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices edged up by 0.2 percent in February following a 0.8 percent
increase in January.
