Homebuilder confidence in the U.S. climbed to another new record high in
the month of October, according to a report released by the National
Association of Home Builders on Monday.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose to 85 in
October from 83 in September. Economists had expected the index to come
in unchanged.

"Traffic remains high and record-low interest rates are keeping demand
strong as the concept of 'home' has taken on renewed importance for
work, study and other purposes in the Covid era," said NAHB Chairman
Chuck Fowke.

He added, "However, it is becoming increasingly challenging to build
affordable homes as shortages of lots, labor, lumber and other key
building materials are lengthening construction times."

The unexpected increase by the housing market index came as all the HMI
indices posted or matched their highest readings ever.

The index gauging current sales conditions rose two points to 90, the
component measuring sales expectations in the next six months increased
three points to 88 and the measure charting traffic of prospective
buyers held steady at 74.

On Tuesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report
on new residential construction in the month of September.
