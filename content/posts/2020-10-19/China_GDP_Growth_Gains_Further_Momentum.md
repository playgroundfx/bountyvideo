China's economic growth gained further momentum in the third quarter
driven by the recovery in domestic consumption, and the global demand
for medical equipments amid the [coronavirus][1] pandemic helped
exporters.

Gross domestic product grew 4.9 percent year-on-year in the third
quarter, faster than the 3.2 percent growth seen in the second quarter,
data published by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed Monday.

However, growth was slower than the economists' forecast of 5.2 percent.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was up 2.7 percent versus the 3.2 percent
growth that economists had expected.

During January to September, the [economy][2] expanded 0.7 percent,
suggesting that the economy shrugged off the record contraction posted
in the first quarter.

In September, retail sales expanded 3.3 percent after posting a marginal
0.5 percent increase in August. Sales were forecast to climb 1.8
percent.

Industrial production advanced 6.9 percent annually, following a 5.6
percent rise a quarter ago. This was also bigger than economists'
forecast of 5.8 percent.

During the nine months to September, fixed asset investment gained 0.8
percent, which was in line with forecast. Property investment grew 5.6
percent.

The unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent a month
ago.

The recovery broadened out and became less reliant on investment-led
stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital
Economics, said. What's more, the monthly data show that growth was
still accelerating heading into the fourth quarter.

While all major global economies are forecast to shrink this year due to
the coronavirus pandemic, the International Monetary Fund upgraded
China's growth projection to 1.9 percent from 1 percent. Growth is
forecast to zoom to 8.2 percent in 2021.
