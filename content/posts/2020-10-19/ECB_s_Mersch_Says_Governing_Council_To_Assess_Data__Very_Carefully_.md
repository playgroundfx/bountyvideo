Policymakers will carefully scrutinize the incoming economic data ahead
of the next [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session to ensure that the effect of the
[coronavirus][1] containment measures are not repeatedly considered in
the backdrop of highly uncertain outlook, European Central Bank
Executive Board member Yves Mersch said Monday.

"Looking ahead, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty the
ECB Governing Council will assess incoming information very carefully,
including developments in the exchange rate, while ensuring that this
incoming information, such as information on containment measures which
is already included in our baseline, is only accounted for once in our
assessment," Mersch said.  
  
He also said that Eurozone economic recovery remains incomplete and are
prone to setbacks.  
  
The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker asserted that the Governing Council continues to stand
ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to bring
inflation back to target.
