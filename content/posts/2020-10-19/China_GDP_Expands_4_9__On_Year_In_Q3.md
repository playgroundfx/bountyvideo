China's gross domestic product was up 4.9 percent on year in the third
quarter of 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday -
missing forecasts for a gain of 5.2 percent but still up from 3.2
percent in the three months prior.

On a quarterly basis, GDP rose 2.7 percent - again shy of expectations
for 3.2 percent and down sharply from the 11.5 percent gain in the
previous three months.

The bureau also said that industrial production jumped 6.9 percent on
year in September - beating forecasts for a gain of 5.8 percent and up
from 5.6 percent in August.

Retail sales climbed an annual 3.3 percent, exceeding expectations for a
rise of 1.8 percent following the 0.5 percent gain in the previous
month.

Fixed asset investment was up 0.8 percent year to date in September,
matching forecasts following the 0.3 percent fall a month earlier.

The jobless rate came in at 5.4 percent in September, down from 5.6
percent in August.
