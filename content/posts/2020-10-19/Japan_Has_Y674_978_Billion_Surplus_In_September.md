Japan posted a merchandise trade surplus of 674.978 billion yen in
September, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of 989.8 billion yen but
still up from the 248.3 billion yen surplus in August.

Exports were down 4.9 percent on year to 6.055 trillion yen - missing
forecasts for a fall of 2.4 percent following the 14.8 percent slide in
the previous month.

Imports sank an annual 17.2 percent to 5.380 trillion yen versus
expectations for a decline of 21.4 percent following the 20.8 percent
drop a month earlier.
