Austria's production index declined at a faster pace in April, amid a
fall in both industrial production and construction output, data from
Statistics Austria showed on Friday.

The production index decreased 21.4 percent year-on-year in April,
following a 9.6 percent fall in March.

This development was attributable to the slump in production in the
metal industry, machine and vehicle construction, and mineral oil
processing and reflected developments throughout the EU, the agency
said.

Industrial production fell 22.0 percent annually in April, and
construction output decreased 19.4 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, the production index declined 15.1 percent in
April, following a 7.0 percent fall in the prior month.

On a monthly basis, industrial production fell 15.3 percent in April and
construction output declined 14.3 percent.
