A report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the
slump in U.S. economic activity in the first quarter was unrevised from
the previous estimate.

The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product tumbled by 5.0
percent in the first quarter, unchanged from the estimate provided last
month.

The steep drop in GDP in the first quarter reflects a notable turnaround
from the 2.1 percent jump seen in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The decrease was unrevised from the previous estimate as an upward
revision to non-residential fixed investment was offset by downward
revisions to private inventory investment, consumer spending and
exports.
