Turkey's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Thursday,
after cutting it by 50 basis points last month.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, led by Governor Murat Uysal, decided to hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate,
which is the one-week repo auction rate, at 8.25 percent. The bank was
expected to cut the rate by 25 basis points.

The bank had reduced the rate four times so far this year.

In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish
[economy][1], the bank observed that it is of crucial importance to
ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel
and firms' cash flows.

According to MPC, recent monetary and fiscal measures contribute to
financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential
output of the economy.

Global commodity prices continued to restrain inflation, while food
price inflation accelerated due to seasonal and pandemic-related
effects. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors
will phase out and demand-driven disinflationary effects will become
more prevalent in the second half of the year, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers noted.

Policymakers observed that keeping the disinflation process in track
with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary
stance.  
Further, the MPC vowed to take all available instruments in pursuit of
the price stability and financial stability objectives.
