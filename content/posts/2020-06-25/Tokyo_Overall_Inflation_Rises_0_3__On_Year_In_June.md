Overall consumer prices in the Tokyo area were up 0.3 percent on year in
June, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Friday.

That missed expectations for an increase of 0.6 percent on year and was
down from 0.4 percent in May.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, was up 0.2 percent on
year - in line with expectations and unchanged from the May reading.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall inflation was down 0.1
percent and core CPI was flat.
