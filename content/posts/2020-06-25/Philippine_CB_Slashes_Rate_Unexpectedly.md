The Philippine central bank lowered its interest rate unexpectedly by 50
basis points to spur growth as measures to combat the [coronavirus][1],
or Covid-19, weighed on economic activity.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, or BSP, on
Thursday, slashed the overnight reverse repurchase facility rate by 50
basis points to a record 2.25 percent. The bank was expected to hold its
rate unchanged.

The bank had reduced its rate by 50 basis points each in April and March
and by 25 basis points in February.

The rates on overnight deposit and lending facilities were lowered to
1.75 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively.

The board noted that a further reduction in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate is required
amidst a benign inflation environment as it would help mitigate the
downside risks to growth and boost market confidence, Governor Benjamin
Diokno said in a statement.

The board viewed that keeping an accommodative stance will further ease
the cost of borrowing and ensure ample credit and liquidity in the
financial system as the [economy][2] transitions toward recovery in the
coming months.

The central bank said the balance of risks to the inflation outlook
leans toward the downside from 2020 up to 2022 owing largely to the
potential impact of a deeper and more disruptive pandemic on domestic
and global demand conditions.

Inflation is seen at 2.3 percent this year and 2.6 percent in 2021.

After the flurry of rate cuts and infusion of liquidity, today's move
may be the last from the central bank in 2020 with Governor Diokno
likely to favour approximating positive real [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates, ING economist
Nicholas Mapa, said.

Meanwhile, the governor is also likely to hold back on reducing reserve
requirements in the near term given that the financial system is flooded
with liquidity with excess funds parked at the central bank's deposit
facilities hitting roughly PHP 1.3 trillion in June, Mapa added.
