Turkish consumer confidence increased for a fifth straight month in
September, survey data from the statistical office Turkstat showed on
Tuesday.  
  
The economic sentiment indicator rose to 88.5 from 85.9 in August. The
index has climbed in every month after hitting a low in April.

A reading above 100 suggests an optimistic outlook, while a score below
100 indicates pessimism.

The latest improvement in the index was due to increases in consumer,
manufacturing and services confidence indicators, the statistical office
said.  
  
Meanwhile, morale weakened in the retail trade and construction sectors.
