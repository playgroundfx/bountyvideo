Vietnam's [economy][1] expanded at a faster pace in the third quarter
but remained below pre-pandemic level, official data showed Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product rose 2.62 percent on yearly basis in the third
quarter, following a revised 0.39 percent rise in the second quarter.

During January to September, exports grew 4.2 percent, while imports
fell 0.8 percent.

In September, consumer prices gained 2.98 percent. Inflation averaged
3.85 percent in the first nine months of the year, which was close to 4
percent target set by the government.

The economy rebounded in the third quarter and should continue to
perform strongly over the coming year, Gareth Leather, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

A surge in exports to the US, aggressive rate cuts by the central bank
and the government's success in containing the virus are all factors
behind Vietnam's outperformance, the economist added.
