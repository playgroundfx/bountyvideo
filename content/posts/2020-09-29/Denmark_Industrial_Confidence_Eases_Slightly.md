Denmark's industrial confidence weakened slightly in September after a
strong improvement in the previous month, survey data from Statistics
Denmark showed on Tuesday.  
  
The industrial confidence index slid to -11 from -10 in August.
Production expectations and the assessment on the finished goods stocks
increased, while the view on order backlogs weakened sharply.  
  
Morale improved in construction and retail, but weakened in the services
sector, the survey showed.  
  
The overall [business][1] confidence indicator climbed to 87.4 from 84.8
in the previous month.  
  
The statistical office noted that around 75 percent of the survey
responses were collected before September 10 when the government
intensified measures to battle the [coronavirus][2] or Covid19 pandemic.
