China's exports continued to expand as global industrial operations
resumed gradually and imports rebounded in September driven by robust
domestic demand, official data revealed on Tuesday.

Data from the General Administration of Customs showed that exports grew
9.9 percent year-on-year, faster than the 9.5 percent increase seen in
August but slightly slower than economists' forecast of 10 percent
growth.

At the same time, imports advanced 13.2 percent in September, in
contrast to a 2.1 percent decline a month ago. Imports were forecast to
rise marginally by 0.3 percent.

Consequently, the trade balance showed a surplus of $37 billion compared
to the expected level of $58 billion. The surplus totaled around $58.9
billion in August.

In the near-term, infrastructure-led stimulus looks set to continue
which, alongside a gradual recovery in oil prices, is likely to keep
imports strong, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at
Capital Economics, said.

Meanwhile, exports should continue to benefit from the recovery in
global demand, the economists noted.

Data revealed that the trade with the U.S. resulted in a surplus of
about $30.8 billion in September.

In yuan [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports increased 10.2 percent year-on-year and imports
advanced 4.3 percent in the third quarter.
