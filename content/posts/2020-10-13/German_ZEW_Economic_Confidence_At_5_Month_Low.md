Germany's economic sentiment deteriorated to a five-month low in October
amid heightened uncertainty surrounding trade talks with the UK and the
run-up to the presidential elections in the US, survey data from the ZEW
- Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research showed on Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell more-than-expected to 56.1
in October from 77.4 in September. The score was forecast to drop to
73.0. The latest reading was the lowest since last May.

Meanwhile, the current conditions index improved to -59.5 from -66.2 in
the previous month. The expected reading was -60.0.

The recent sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases has increased
uncertainty about future economic development, as has the prospect of
the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal, ZEW President Achim Wambach,
said.

The current situation in the run-up to the presidential election in the
United States further fuels uncertainty, Wambach added.

"The great euphoria witnessed in August and September seems to have
evaporated," Wambach said.

The largest euro area [economy][1] had contracted by a record 9.7
percent in the second quarter. However, with the easing of lockdown
restrictions, the economy is widely expected to rebound in the third
quarter.

Financial market experts' sentiment concerning the economic development
of the euro area also took a nosedive in October, the survey showed. The
economic sentiment indicator plunged 21.6 points to 52.3 in October.

Meanwhile, the current economic situation climbed 4.3 points to minus
76.6 points in October.
