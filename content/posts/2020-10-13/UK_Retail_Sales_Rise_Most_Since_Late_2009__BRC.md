UK retail sales grew at the fastest pace since 2009 as consumers
resorted to stockpiling amid rising Covid-19 cases, data from the
British Retail Consortium revealed Tuesday.

Total retail sales grew 5.6 percent annually in September versus a 0.6
percent drop a year ago. This was the fastest growth since December
2009, excluding Easter distortions.

Similarly, like-for-like sales increased 6.1 percent, in contrast to a
1.3 percent decrease in the same period last year.

Over the three months to September, food sales increased 5.1 percent on
a like-for-like basis and 5.6 percent on a total basis. This was higher
than the 12-month total average growth of 3.8 percent.

At the same time, non-food retail sales increased by 5.2 percent on a
like-for-like basis and 3.2 percent on a total basis.

September sales have also given retailers early signs that consumers are
starting their Christmas shopping earlier this year, which retailers are
encouraging their customers to do in order to manage demand at Christmas
and keep people safe, Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive at BRC, said.
However, store-based sales, excluding food are still in double digit
decline.

Susan Barratt, chief executive at the grocery consultancy IGD, said late
September has seen some stockpiling as shoppers react to rising Covid-19
cases and possible further restrictions, although this is far from the
level of panic buying experienced in March.

Speculation concerning further lockdown measures and a possible no deal
EU exit is leading to uncertainty among shoppers, with IGD's Shopper
Confidence Index remaining low but stable, Barratt noted.
