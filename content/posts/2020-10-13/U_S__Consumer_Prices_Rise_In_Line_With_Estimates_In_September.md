Consumer prices in the U.S. showed a modest increase in the month of
September, according to a report released by the Labor Department on
Tuesday, with the uptick in prices matching economist estimates.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.2 percent
in September after climbing by 0.4 percent in August.

Prices for used cars and trucks spiked by 6.7 percent, accounting for
most of the monthly increase by the headline index.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices still edged up by
0.2 percent in September following the 0.4 percent growth seen in
August. The uptick in core prices also matched estimates.
