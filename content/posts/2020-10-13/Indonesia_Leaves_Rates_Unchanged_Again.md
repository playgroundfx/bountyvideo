Indonesia's central bank left its key interest unchanged on Tuesday, for
a third consecutive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session.

The board of Bank Indonesia left the 7-day reverse repo rate unchanged
at 4 percent, as expected.

The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in July.

The bank had reduced the key interest rate four times this year to
support the [economy][1] amid the crisis caused by the coronavirus or
Covid-19 pandemic.

The overnight deposit facility rate and the lending facility rate were
left unchanged at 3.25 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively.

The latest decision considers the need to maintain a stable Rupiah
