The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to expand in March, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economic showed on
Thursday with a record-high seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI score
of 53.2.

That's up from 50.9 in February, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, the survey saw the sharpest increases in output and new
orders in its decade-long [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). It also saw its fastest rise in input
costs since October 2018.

Firms were increasingly confident that improvements in output would be
sustained over the coming year, with [business][1] confidence hitting a
50-month high.
