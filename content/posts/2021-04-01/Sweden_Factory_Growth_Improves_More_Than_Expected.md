Sweden's manufacturing sector expanded further at a faster than expected
pace in March, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association
SILF showed Thursday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector climbed to a
three-month high of 63.7 from 61.8 in February. Economists had expected
an improvement to 62.5.

A PMI reading above 50 suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

The score remained above the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average of 55.4 for the seventh
month in a row.

The biggest positive contribution came from the sub-index for order
intake. The measure for production plans eased in March, but remained at
a markedly high level. The sub-index for input costs climbed to its
highest level since 2004.

The PMI reading for the first quarter was the highest since 2010,
Swedbank said.

The Swedish manufacturing industry continues to show a high level of
activity despite major disruptions in global trade flows and shortages
of several inputs but which can come sour afterwards, Swedbank analyst
Jorgen  
Kennemar said.

The latest PMI survey was conducted between March 10-26.
