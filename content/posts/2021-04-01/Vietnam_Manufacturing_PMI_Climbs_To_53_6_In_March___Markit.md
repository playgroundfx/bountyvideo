The manufacturing sector in Vietnam continued to expand in March, and at
a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economic showed on Thursday
with a seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI score of 53.6.

That's up from 51.6 in February, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, there were faster expansions in output, new orders and
exports, while [business][1] confidence hit its highest level since July
2019.

Input prices saw their sharpest increase in more than four years.
