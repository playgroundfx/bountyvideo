Russia's manufacturing expansion slowed slightly in March as production
growth slowed and vendor performance deteriorated to its the weakest in
nearly a year, survey data from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The IHS Markit Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
eased to 51.1 in March from 51.5 in February. A PMI reading above 50
signals growth in the sector.

The survey also showed that the rate of cost inflation was the slowest
in five months in March but remained at a high level.

IHS Markit economist Sian Jones blamed price hikes and supply shortages
for slower production growth, and the softer client demand for the
smaller increase in new orders.

"Further [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly elevated rates of inflation in March add to
concern regarding building price pressures through 2021 to date by the
Central Bank of Russia," the economist said.

"We are currently forecasting three more interest rates hikes before the
end of the year."
