A day ahead of the release of the more closely watched monthly jobs
report, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing
first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rebounded from their
lowest level in a year in the week ended March 27th.

The report said initial jobless claims rose to 719,000, an increase of
61,000 from the previous week's revised level of 658,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 680,000 from the
684,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The downwardly revised number of claims in the previous week was the
lowest since the week ended March 14, 2020, just before the start of the
[coronavirus][1] lockdowns.
