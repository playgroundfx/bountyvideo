The euro area manufacturing sector grew at the strongest pace in nearly
24 years of data collection, underpinned by strong production and
orders, final data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The final factory Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 62.5 in March from
57.9 in February. The flash reading was 62.4.

The score has been above the neutral 50.0 no-change mark for the ninth
consecutive month, suggesting growth in the sector.

There were record rises in both output and new orders in March. New
export orders also increased for the ninth consecutive month and at a
series record pace.

The further strengthening of trade, orders and production placed further
strain on already stretched supply chains.

Consequently, input costs grew at the fastest rate in a decade. Average
prices charged by manufacturers also increased sharply in March. The
output price inflation reached its highest level since April 2011.

Growth was broad-based across the region, with Germany and the
Netherlands leading the way. Italy and France both registered levels
amongst the highest in their respective survey histories. And Spain
posted its best performance since late 2006.

Germany IHS Markit/BME factory PMI climbed to an all-time high of 66.6,
as initially estimated, from 60.7 in February.

France final manufacturing PMI advanced to 59.3 from 56.1 in the
previous month. The flash reading was 58.8. The latest reading signaled
the fastest growth since September 2000.

Italy's factory PMI improved to 59.8, in line with expectations, from
56.9 in the previous month, suggesting the steepest improvement in
manufacturing conditions for 21 years.

Spain's manufacturing PMI advanced more-than-expected to 56.9 in March
from 52.9 in the previous month. The expected reading was 56.0.
