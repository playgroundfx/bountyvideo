The Czech Republic's manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest pace
in over three years in March amid strong growth in output and new
orders, survey data from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for the manufacturing sector
climbed to 58 from 56.5 in February. The reading was in line with
economists' expectations.

A PMI reading above 50 signals growth in the sector. The latest reading
showed the fastest improvement in operating conditions since February
2018, IHS Markit said.

Export growth was the strongest since April 2018.

Meanwhile, vendor performance deteriorated sharply and price pressures
remained significant.

Input costs rose at a record pace mainly due to raw material supply
shortages caused by the transportation delays due to [coronavirus][1]
lockdown restrictions.

Consequently, several firms raised selling prices at the fastest pace
since January 2008.  
  
The survey data was collected during March 12-23.

"Firms expect output to increase over the coming year, with
[business][2] confidence at its second-highest since July 2018," IHS
Markit economist Sian Jones said.

"We currently forecast that industrial production will rise 7.6 percent
in 2021, but much remains uncertain amid rising COVID-19 cases in the
country."
