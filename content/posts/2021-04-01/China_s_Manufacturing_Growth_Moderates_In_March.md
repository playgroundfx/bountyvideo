China's manufacturing sector growth moderated in March suggesting that
the post-epidemic recovery was continuing to falter, survey results from
IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The Caixin factory Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 50.6 in March from
50.9 in the previous month. This was the lowest reading since April
2020. Nonetheless, a score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Chinese manufacturers raised their production in March but the rate of
growth edged down to an 11-month low. At the same time, total new work
expanded at a fractionally weaker pace. New export [business][1]
returned to growth, as global economic conditions continued to recover.

The sustained upturn in new orders led to renewed pressure on
capacities, with backlogs of work rising moderately after a marginal
drop in February. Further, the rate of job shedding eased to a marginal
pace.

Despite easing of supply chain disruption, firms reported a sharp and
accelerated rise in input costs in March amid reports of greater raw
material prices. Consequently, firms raised their selling prices and at
the most marked rate since November 2016.

The growing inflationary pressure limits the room for future policies
and is not a good thing for sustaining an economic recovery in the
postepidemic period, Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight
Group said.

Looking ahead, manufacturers were highly confident that output would
continue to rise over the next year, with the level of positive
sentiment among the highest seen over the past seven years.
