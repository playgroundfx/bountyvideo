The manufacturing sector in Malaysia continued to contract in March,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economic showed
on Thursday with a seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI score of 49.9.

That's up from 47.7 in February, although it remains barely beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders remained subdues amid supply chain
disruptions, although employment levels rose for the first time in a
year and [business][1] expectations strengthened further.

Input costs meanwhile increased for the tenth consecutive month in
March, reflecting higher prices for a broad variety of raw materials and
higher freight costs.
