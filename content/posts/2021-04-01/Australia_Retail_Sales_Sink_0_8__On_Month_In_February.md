The total value of retail sales in Australia was down a seasonally
adjusted 0.8 percent on month in February, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Thursday - coming in at A$30.300 billion.

That beat expectations for a decline of 1.1 percent following the 0.3
percent increase in January.

Individually, food retailing fell 3.0 percent on month, while household
goods rose 0.7 percent, clothing rose 1.6 percent, department store
sales rose 2.2 percent, other retailing fell 0.4 percent and restaurants
gained 1.1 percent.

On a yearly basis, retail sales were up 9.1 percent.
