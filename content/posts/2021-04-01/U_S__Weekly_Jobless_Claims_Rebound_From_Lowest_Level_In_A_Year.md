A day ahead of the release of the more closely watched monthly jobs
report, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing
first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rebounded from their
lowest level in a year in the week ended March 27th.

The report said initial jobless claims rose to 719,000, an increase of
61,000 from the previous week's revised level of 658,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 680,000 from the
684,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The downwardly revised number of claims in the previous week was the
lowest since the week ended March 14, 2020, just before the start of the
[coronavirus][1] lockdowns.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the four-week moving average edged
down to 719,000, a decrease of 10,500 from the previous week's revised
average of 729,500.

With the modest decrease, the less volatile four-week moving average
dropped to its lowest level in over a year.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also fell to 3.794 million in the week ended
March 20th, a decrease of 46,000 from the previous week's revised level.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims slid to 3,978,500, a
decrease of 147,250 from the previous week's revised average of
4,125,750.

"The level of claims remains elevated - regular claims are still above
the Global Financial Crisis peak - but we expect they will start to
recede at a more rapid pace as the recovery gains momentum," said Nancy
Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "We look for a significant improvement in the labor market
over the course of 2021, with a total of 7.5mn jobs added and the
unemployment rate falling to 4.3% by the end of the year."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report for March.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 647,000 jobs in March
after climbing by 379,000 jobs in February. The unemployment rate is
expected to drop to 6.0 percent from 6.2 percent.
