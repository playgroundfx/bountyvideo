Europe's passenger car sales logged a double-digit decline in August,
data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA,
showed Thursday.

Car registrations decreased 18.9 percent year-on-year, following a 5.7
percent drop in July.

Among 27 member states, only Cyprus reported an annual growth of 14.1
percent in August. All other countries in the region recorded losses
despite easing of the [coronavirus][1] containment measures.

Italy's car sales were down marginally by 0.4 percent, while Germany and
France posted bigger falls of 20 percent and 19.8 percent, respectively.
Sales in Spain slid 10.1 percent.

According to ACEA, the UK car sales were down 5.8 percent annually in
August.

During January to August, EU demand for passenger cars contracted by
32.0 percent from last year. About 6.12 million new cars were registered
across the European Union during the period, almost 2.9 million less
than during the same period last year.
