A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time
claims for U.S. unemployment benefits fell less than expected in the
week ended September 12th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims slipped to 860,000, a
decrease of 33,000 from the previous week's revised level of 893,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 850,000 from the
884,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the modest pullback, jobless claims fell to their lowest level
since hitting 282,000 before the [coronavirus][1]-induced lockdowns in
March.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
fell to 912,000, a decrease of 61,000 from the previous week's revised
average of 973,000.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also plunged by 916,000 to 12.628 million in
the week ended September 5th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims tumbled to 13,489,000,
a decrease of 532,750 from the previous week's revised average of
14,021,750.

"Sifting through the messy jobless claims data, we find that layoffs
remain widespread and a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly high number of individuals are
still receiving some type of jobless benefits," said Nancy Vanden
Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Failure on the part of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers to enact another fiscal
relief package poses significant downside risks to the [economy][2] and
labor market as the recovery appears to be losing momentum."
