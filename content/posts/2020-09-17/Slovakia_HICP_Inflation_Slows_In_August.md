Slovakia's EU measure of inflation eased to the lowest in over three
years in August, data from the Statistical Office Of the Slovak Republic
showed on Wednesday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 1.4 percent year-
on-year in August, after 1.8 percent increase in July. This was the
lowest since June 2017, when it rose 1.0 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, the HICP decreased 0.1 percent in August,
reversing a 0.1 percent rise in the preceding month.

Earlier, the statistical office reported that the consumer price index
rose 1.4 percent annually in August, after a 1.7 percent increase in the
previous month.

The core inflation increased to 1.5 percent in August.
