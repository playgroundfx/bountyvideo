Germany's [economy][1] is expected to contract less than initially
projected this year but the economic upturn from the coronavirus driven
downturn started to lose momentum, the IfW-Kiel Institute said Thursday.

The largest euro area economy is forecast to slump 5.5 percent this year
compared to the previous projection of 6.8 percent.

But growth outlook for 2021 was revised down to 4.8 percent from 6.3
percent as ongoing restriction for some industries and weakness in the
global economy in general is slowing down the recovery.

According to IfW-Kiel, GDP will grow 6.2 percent in the third quarter
but the recovery will slow down thereafter.

Economic output will not catch up to pre-crisis levels before the end of
next year and will then still be 3 percent below the level that would
have been possible without the Corona crisis, the institute noted.
