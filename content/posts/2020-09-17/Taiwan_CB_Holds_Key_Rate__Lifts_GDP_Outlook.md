Taiwan's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged as expected
and lifted its growth outlook for this year citing strong exports of
goods following the easing of the [coronavirus][1] containment measures
by trading partners.

Policymakers decided to hold the benchmark rate at a record low 1.125
percent.

The Board of Governors of assessed that maintaining the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest
rate unchanged and continuing loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will help prices
stability and financial stability, and support economic growth.

Driven by robust exports and recovery in retail sales, the [economy][2]
is forecast to grow 1.6 percent this year, which was revised up from 1.5
percent estimated in June.

GDP growth is forecast to advance to 3.28 percent next year. The bank
said manufacturers are likely to ramp up their production capacity after
major trading partners stabilize.

The bank expects exports and private investment to grow further next
year and private consumption to expand moderately.

Consumer prices are forecast to fall 0.2 percent this year before rising
to 0.92 percent in 2021.

"Given the relatively strong performance of the economy, we doubt the
central bank will be in any rush to cut rates any further," Gareth
Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
