The Bank of England retained its interest rate at a record low on
Thursday, but [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers started to assess how negative interest rates
work amid talks on post Brexit trade deal, the recent rise in Covid-19
cases and the rising risk of elevated unemployment.

The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee unanimously decided to hold
the interest rate at 0.10 percent, as widely expected. The bank had
altogether reduced the rate by 65 basis points at two unscheduled
meetings in March.

Policymakers also unanimously decided to retain the size of the asset
purchase programme at GBP 745 billion.

The BoE together with the bank regulators will begin 'structured
engagement' on the operational considerations of negative rates in the
fourth quarter of this year.

The key interest rate has never been below zero.

The MPC had been briefed on the BoE's plans to explore how a negative
Bank Rate could be implemented effectively, should the outlook for
inflation and output warrant it at some point during this period of low
equilibrium rates.

Markets are expecting an expansion to its quantitative easing at the
November meeting.

Further preparation for negative rates is likely to be taken as a
vindication of market expectations and brings more downside risk to gilt
yields, Antoine Bouvet and Petr Krpata, economists at ING, said.

"We remain confident that an increase in the APF is more likely in the
near-term," they said.

Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics, said he still think
that the bank will loosen [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) further, most likely in the form of
more QE rather than negative interest rates as the market expects.

The bank is expected to add QE by GBP 250 billion over the course of the
next year, with an installment of GBP 100 billion in November, Wishart
added.  
  
The MPC said it does not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until there
is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating
spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation target sustainably.

Policymakers noted that the outlook for the [economy][1] remains
"unusually uncertain".

According to the bank staff, in the third quarter of 2020, GDP would to
be around 7 percent below its 2019 fourth quarter level, but less weak
than had been expected in the August Report.

CPI inflation is expected to remain below 1 percent until early 2021,
albeit slightly higher than expected at the time of the August Report.  
  
As the August inflation was more than one percentage point below the 2
percent target, BoE Governor wrote an open letter to the Chancellor
Rishi Sunak explaining the reason for the decline.

Governor Andrew Bailey said the MPC expected a period of low inflation
in the near term due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

He also added that the temporary cut in VAT for hospitality, holiday
accommodation and attractions, together with the Government's Eat Out to
Help Out scheme, were expected to lead to a material drop in inflation
in August.

In his reply to Bailey, Sunak said the government's commitment to the
BoE's operational independence and the flexible inflation targeting
regime, with an operational target of 2 percent CPI inflation, remains
absolute.
