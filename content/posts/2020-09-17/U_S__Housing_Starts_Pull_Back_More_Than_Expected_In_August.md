After reporting a substantial increase in new residential construction
in the U.S. in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a
report on Thursday showing housing starts pulled back by much more than
expected in the month of August.

The report said housing starts tumbled by 5.1 percent to an annual rate
of 1.416 million in August after soaring by 17.9 percent to a revised
rate of 1.492 million in July.

Economists had expected housing starts to pullback by 1.2 percent to a
rate of 1.478 million from the 1.496 million originally reported for the
previous month.

The Labor Department said building permits also fell by 0.9 percent to
an annual rate of 1.470 million in August after spiking by 17.9 percent
to a revised rate of 1.483 million in July.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, had been
expected to increase by 1.7 percent to a rate of 1.520 million from the
1.495 million originally reported for the previous month.
