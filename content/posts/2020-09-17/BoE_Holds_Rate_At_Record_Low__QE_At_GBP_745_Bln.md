Policymakers of the Bank of England unanimously decided to hold its
record low interest rate and quantitative easing unchanged on Thursday.

The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee unanimously voted to hold the
interest rate at 0.10 percent, as widely expected. The bank had
altogether reduced the rate by 65 basis points at two unscheduled
meetings in March.

The bank retained the size of the asset purchase programme at GBP 745
billion.

The Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remains
appropriate.

The MPC said it does not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until there
is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating
spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation target sustainably.

CPI inflation is expected to remain below 1 percent until early 2021,
albeit slightly higher than expected at the time of the August Report.

Policymakers noted that the outlook for the [economy][1] remains
unusually uncertain.

According to bank staff, in the third quarter of 2020, GDP would to be
around 7 percent below its 2019 fourth quarter level, but less weak than
had been expected in the August Report.

The MPC had been briefed on the BoE's plans to explore how a negative
Bank Rate could be implemented effectively, should the outlook for
inflation and output warrant it at some point during this period of low
equilibrium rates.
