Eurozone construction output growth eased sharply in July, Eurostat
reported on Thursday.

The construction output increased 0.2 percent month-on-month in July,
after a 5.1 percent rise in June.

Production in building construction remained unchanged, while that of
civil engineering rose 1.1 percent.

On a year-on-year basis, the construction output fell 3.8 percent in
July, following a 4.8 percent decline in the prior month.

In the EU27, construction output decreased 0.1 percent monthly, and fell
3.9 percent from the same month a year ago.

Among member states, the biggest increases were recorded in Slovenia,
France and Romania, and the largest decreases were observed in Germany,
Poland and Sweden.
