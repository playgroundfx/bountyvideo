The Bank of Japan maintained its massive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus and
slightly lifted its assessment about the [economy][1] on Thursday, after
Yoshihide Suga took charge as new Prime Minister.

The Policy Board of the BoJ headed by Haruhiko Kuroda voted 8-1 to
retain the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that
financial institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The bank will actively buy exchange-traded funds and Japan real estate
investment trusts so that their outstanding amounts will increase at
annual paces with the upper limit of about JPY 12 trillion and around
JPY 180 billion, respectively.

As for CP and corporate bonds, the bank will maintain their outstanding
amounts at about JPY 2 trillion and JPY 3 trillion, respectively.

The bank has lifted its assessment, saying that the economy has started
to pick up with economic activity resuming gradually, although it has
remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel
[coronavirus][2].

The BoJ observed that exports and industrial production have turned to a
pick-up, while corporate profits and [business][3] sentiment
deteriorated. Business fixed investment has been on a declining trend.

The bank reiterated that it will not hesitate to take further monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing if required, and it expects short- and long-term [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
rates to remain at their present or lower levels.
