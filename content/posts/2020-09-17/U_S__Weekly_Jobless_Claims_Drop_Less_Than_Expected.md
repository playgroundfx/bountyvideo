week ended September 12th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims slipped to 860,000, a
decrease of 33,000 from the previous week's revised level of 893,000.

884,000 originally reported for the previous week.

fell to 912,000, a decrease of 61,000 from the previous week's revised
average of 973,000.
