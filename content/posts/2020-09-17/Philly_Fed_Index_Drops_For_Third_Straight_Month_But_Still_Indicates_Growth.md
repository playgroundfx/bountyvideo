Growth in Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity slowed modestly in
the month of September, according to a report released by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity slipped to
15.0 in September after dropping to 17.2 in August, although a positive
reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing. The dip by the
index matched economist estimates.

The headline index fell for the third consecutive month despite a faster
rate of growth in new orders and a significant acceleration in the pace
of growth in shipments.

The report said the new orders index jumped to 25.5 in September from
19.0 in August, while the shipments index spiked to 36.6 from 9.4.

The number of employees index also surged up to 15.7 in September from
9.0 in August, indicating a faster rate of job growth.

The prices paid index also shot up to 25.1 in September from 15.3 in
August, while the prices received index climbed to 18.4 from 12.4.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said nearly all of the future indexes
increased, suggesting more widespread optimism among firms about growth
over the next six months.

The report said the diffusion index for future general activity spiked
to 56.6 in September after edging up to 38.8 in August.

"The third consecutive monthly decline of the Philly Fed manufacturing
index in September signals regional activity is falling in line with the
slower pace of underlying economic expansion," said Nancy Vanden Houten,
Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Encouragingly, manufacturers are maintaining their near-term
optimism and envision the need to increase activity and hiring ahead."

On Tuesday, New York Fed released a separate report showing a
significant acceleration in the pace of growth in regional manufacturing
activity in the month of September.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index jumped
to 17.0 in September from 3.7 in August. Economists had expected the
index to rise to 6.0.
