Growth in Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity slowed modestly in
the month of September, according to a report released by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity slipped to
15.0 in September after dropping to 17.2 in August, although a positive
reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing. The dip by the
index matched economist estimates.

Meanwhile, the report said nearly all of the future indexes increased,
suggesting more widespread optimism among firms about growth over the
next six months.
