Various stimulus measures adopted by the Reserve Bank of Australia since
March have achieved their objective in keeping funding costs low and
ensured credit supply, especially to small businesses, Reserve Bank of
Australia's Head of Domestic Markets Marion Kohler said in a speech on
Thursday.

In March, the central bank had cut the key interest rate by 50 basis
points in two sessions and announced asset purchases, in response to the
risks posed by the economic disruption caused by the [coronavirus][1],
or Covid-19, pandemic.

"The cash rate reductions have flowed through in full to interest rates
on outstanding [business][2] loans," Kohler said citing data.

Interest rates on business loans have declined to [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low
levels and they have fallen by much more than the cash rate reductions,
the official said.

Meanwhile, the volume of lending to small and medium enterprises, or
SMEs, has been little changed since the onset of the pandemic, Kohler
pointed out. This could be due to a lack of demand for new loans, due to
the heightened uncertainty for many small businesses in the current
environment, she said.

At the same time, banks are also more cautious about lending to
businesses, especially to new businesses and to businesses in those
sectors most affected by the pandemic, the official said.

Further, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) package put in place in March is working to lower
borrowers' interest rates and ease their loan payment burdens as housing
loans are refinanced, she said. As lockdown rules were relaxed, lending
for new housing loans also picked up.  
  
Personal credit shrunk drastically over the past six months amid the
implementation of Covid-19 containment measures and the recent
developments have worked to reduce the stock of outstanding credit card
debt, Kohler said.
