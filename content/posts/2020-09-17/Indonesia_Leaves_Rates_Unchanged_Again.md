Indonesia's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged on
Thursday it expects inflation to remain low and economic expansion to be
gradual.  
  
Bank Indonesia left the 7-day reverse repo rate unchanged at 4 percent
as expected. The bank had reduced the key interest rate four times this
year to support the [economy][1] amid the crisis caused by Covid-19.  
  
The overnight deposit facility rate and the lending facility rate were
maintained at 3.25 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively.

"The decision is consistent with the need to maintain rupiah exchange
rate stability against a backdrop of projected low inflation," the bank
said.  
  
The central bank also announced a host of stimulus measures that
included an extension of the 50 basis points lower rupiah reserve
requirements from December 31, 2020 previously until June 30, 2021.  
  
This serves as an incentive for banks disbursing loans to small and
medium enterprises and for export-import activity as well as to non-SMEs
operating in priority sectors as stipulated in the national economic
recovery program, the bank said.

The central bank expects the rupiah to regain lost value as the currency
is still fundamentally undervalued. This strengthening will be supported
by low and stable inflation, a narrow current account deficit, highly
attractive domestic financial assets for investment as well as a lower
risk premium in Indonesia.

Bank Indonesia projects inflation for 2020 and 2021 to remain under
control within the 3.0 percent Â±1 percent target corridor, and a low
current account deficit below 1.5 percent of GDP this year, thus
reinforcing external sector resilience.
