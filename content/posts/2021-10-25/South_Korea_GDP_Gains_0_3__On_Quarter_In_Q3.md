South Korea's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.3
percent on quarter in the third quarter of 2021, the Bank of Korea said
in Tuesday's advance estimate.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 0.6 percent and down
from 0.8 percent in the previous three months.

On an annualized basis, GDP grew 4.0 percent - again missing forecasts
for 4.2 percent and slowing from 6.0 percent in the three months prior.

Real gross domestic income also was up 0.3 percent on quarter and it
gained 2.4 percent on year.
