Belgium's [business][1] confidence was unchanged in October, after a
sharp weakening in the previous month, survey data from the National
Bank of Belgium showed Monday.

The business confidence index showed a score of 4.0, same as in
September, the survey data revealed. In August, the reading was 7.6.

"The stabilization of the business barometer masks contrasting trends
between branches of activity: an upturn is observed in business-related
services, while confidence is dropping back in the other branches of
activity," the bank said.

The seasonally adjusted rate has thus fallen back from 81.1 percent July
to 79.9 percent in October.
