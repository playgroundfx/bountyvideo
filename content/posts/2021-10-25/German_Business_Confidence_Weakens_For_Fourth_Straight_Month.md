German [business][1] confidence weakened for the fourth consecutive
month in October to hit a six-month low as supply bottlenecks weighed
heavily on expectations, survey results from the ifo Institute showed on
Monday.

The business confidence index fell more-than-expected to 97.7 in October
from revised 98.9 in September. The expected level was 97.9. This was
the lowest since last April.

The current situation indicator came in at 100.1, down from 100.4 a
month ago and below the economists' forecast of 99.4.

The expectations index dropped to 95.4 from 97.4 in the previous month.
The reading was forecast to fall to 96.4.

Supply problems are giving businesses headaches, Clemens Fuest, ifo
President said. Sand in the wheels of the German [economy][2] is
hampering recovery.

"The fourth successive monthly fall in the Ifo Business Climate Index
provides more evidence - if it were needed - that supply side disruption
is causing the German economy to slow sharply and suggests that the
problems are extending beyond manufacturing," Andrew Kenningham, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

The economist expects the economy to do no more than tread water in the
last three months of the year.

In manufacturing, the business climate index fell once again. Companies
were somewhat less satisfied with their current business and their
expectations were also clouding further.

In the service sector, the business climate worsened again after a
recovery in the previous month. Companies were considerably less
optimistic about the coming months. However, their assessments of the
current business situation were slightly improved.

In trade, business confidence weakened considerably in October.
Businesses were notably less satisfied with their current situation and
were more pessimistic about the coming months. Supply bottlenecks were
weighing on sentiment.

In construction, the business climate improved further in October.
Companies' assessments of their current situation were a little better.
Moreover, the expectations index rose for the sixth consecutive time.
