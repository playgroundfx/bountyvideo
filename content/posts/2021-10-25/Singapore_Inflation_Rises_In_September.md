Singapore consumer price inflation rises marginally in September, data
published by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of
Trade and Industry showed on Monday.

Consumer price inflation slowed to 2.5 percent in September from 2.4
percent in August. The rate came in line with economists' expectations.

This latest consumer prices outcome was largely due to a rise in prices
for core inflation and accommodation cost.

MAS core inflation edged up to 1.2 percent in September from 1.1 percent
in the previous month.

The increase in core rate was largely driven by higher food inflation.

For 2021 as a whole, MAS core inflation is expected to average 0-1
percent, while overall inflation is forecast to come in between 1-2
percent in 2022.
