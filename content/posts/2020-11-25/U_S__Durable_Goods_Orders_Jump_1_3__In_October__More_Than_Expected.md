New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods increased by more than
expected in the month of October, the Commerce Department revealed in a
report on Wednesday.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders jumped by 1.3 percent
in October after spiking by 2.1 percent in September. Economists had
expected durable goods orders to climb by 0.9 percent.

Excluding an increase in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders still surged up by 1.3 percent in October after jumping by
1.5 percent in September. Ex-transportation orders were expected to rise
by 0.4 percent.

The report showed significant increases in orders for computers and
electronic products and fabricated metal products.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a key indicator
of [business][1] spending, also rose by 0.7 percent in October after
spiking by 1.9 percent in September.

A separate report released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday
showed the spike in gross domestic product in the third quarter was
unrevised from the initial estimate.

The Commerce Department said GDP skyrocketed by an annual rate of 33.1
percent in the third quarter after plunging by 31.4 percent in the
second quarter. The unrevised reading on GDP matched economist
estimates.

The report said upward revisions to non-residential fixed investment,
residential fixed investment, and exports were offset by downward
revisions to state and local government spending, private inventory
investment, and consumer spending.
