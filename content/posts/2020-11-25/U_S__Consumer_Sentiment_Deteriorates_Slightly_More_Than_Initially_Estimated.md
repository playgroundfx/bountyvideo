Revised data released by the University of Michigan on Wednesday showed
consumer sentiment in the U.S. deteriorated by slightly more than
expected in the month of November.

The report said the consumer sentiment index for November was downwardly
revised to 76.9 from a preliminary reading of 77.0. Economists had
expected the index to be unrevised, which was still down from 81.8 in
October.

"Consumer sentiment was unchanged in late November--a difference of just
0.1 points from mid-month--although there was a significant decline in
the Expectations component which was offset by more favorable
assessments of current economic conditions," said Surveys of Consumers
chief economist, Richard Curtin.

He added, "Importantly, the November data were less optimistic than last
month due to the resurgence in covid infections and deaths as well as
partisan shifts due to the outcome of the presidential election."

The report said the index of consumer expectations tumbled to 70.5 in
November from 79.2 in October, while the current economic conditions
index rose to 87.0 from 85.9.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations ticked up to 2.8
percent in November from 2.6 percent in October and five-year inflation
expectations inched up to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent.
