UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Wednesday boosted spending
on infrastructure and plans to create jobs for the unemployed as
official forecasts pointed to the worst economic contraction in over 300
years due to the impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

"Our [health][2] emergency is not yet over," Sunak told lawmakers as he
presented the latest Spending Review.

"And our economic emergency has only just begun."

The chancellor said public services funding to tackle coronavirus will
total GBP 55 billion next year.

Earlier in the day, the Office for Budget Responsibility projected an
11.3 percent contraction for the UK [economy][3] this year, which will
be the biggest fall in output for more than 300 years.

The economy is expected recover as Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are
eased and log 5.5 percent growth next year and 6.6 percent expansion in
2022. The pace of growth is seen slowing to 2.3 percent in the following
year.

That said, UK growth is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels
until the fourth quarter of 2022.  
  
The damage will be lasting and is likely to keep the economy 3 percent
smaller than earlier expected in 2025, Sunak said.

The chancellor raised borrowing to a record level for the peacetime.
Borrowing is forecast at GBP 394 billion, or 19 percent of GDP, this
year.  
This is expected to fall to GBP 16 billion next year and be around 4
percent of GDP beyond 2022-23.  
  
Underlying debt was forecast at 91.9 percent of GDP this year, excluding
the one-off effect of the Bank of England asset purchases. The ratio is
expected to keep growing and reach 97.5 percent in 2025-26.  
  
Sunak allocated nearly GBP 3 billion to start a new three-year Restart
Programme aimed to help over a million unemployed people find new work.  
  
Despite the support measures from the government such as the furlough
scheme, OBR projected unemployment to peak in the second quarter of next
at 7.5 percent or 2.6 million people. Joblessness is then forecast to
drop every year and touch 4.4 percent by the end of 2024.  
  
The chancellor guaranteed a pay rise of at least GBP 250 to 2.1 million
public sector workers who earn below the median wage of GBP 24,000.

He also announced a pay rise to over a million nurses, doctors and
others working in the NHS, but decided to freeze pay rise for the rest
of the public sector in a bid to protect jobs.  
  
Sunak accepted recommendation to raise the National Living Wage by 2.2
percent to GBP 8.91 an hour, extend it to those aged 23 and above, and
also to increase the National Minimum Wage rate.  
  
The core health budget is set grow by GBP 6.6 billion and the capital
investment in the health care sector is set to be increased by GBP 2.3
billion.

Sunak increased the schools' budget next year by GBP 2.2 billion.  
  
The chancellor also launched a GBP 7.1 billion National Home Building
Fund.
