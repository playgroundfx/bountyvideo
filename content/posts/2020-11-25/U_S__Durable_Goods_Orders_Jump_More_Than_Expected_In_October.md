New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods increased by more than
expected in the month of October, the Commerce Department revealed in a
report on Wednesday.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders jumped by 1.3 percent
in October after spiking by 2.1 percent in September. Economists had
expected durable goods orders to climb by 0.9 percent.

Excluding an increase in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders still surged up by 1.3 percent in October after jumping by
1.5 percent in September. Ex-transportation orders were expected to rise
by 0.4 percent.
