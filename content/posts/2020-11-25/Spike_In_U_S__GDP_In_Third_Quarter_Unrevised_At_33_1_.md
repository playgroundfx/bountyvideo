A report released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed the
spike in gross domestic product in the third quarter was unrevised from
the initial estimate.

The Commerce Department said GDP skyrocketed by an annual rate of 33.1
percent in the third quarter after plunging by 31.4 percent in the
second quarter. The unrevised reading on GDP matched economist
estimates.

The report said upward revisions to non-residential fixed investment,
residential fixed investment, and exports were offset by downward
revisions to state and local government spending, private inventory
investment, and consumer spending.
