The European Central Bank said lenders might require higher loan loss
provisioning amid missed payments and rising number of corporate
defaults.

In the latest Financial Stability Review, released Wednesday, the ECB
said since the global financial crisis, weak profitability prospects
continue to weigh on bank valuations despite the increased resilience of
euro area banks.

The bank noted that downside risks to bank profitability arise from a
weaker outlook for lending volumes and signs of optimistic provisioning.

"A weaker than expected economic recovery or premature end of loan
guarantees coupled with growing vulnerabilities in the non-financial
private sector may entail higher loan loss provisioning needs and weigh
on bank profitability," the bank added.

Further, the central bank observed that the euro area property
[markets][1] are at the risk of correction. High household indebtedness
makes the housing market even more vulnerable in some countries, the ECB
noted.

The bank said the strength in asset prices and renewed risk-taking make
some markets increasingly susceptible to corrections.
