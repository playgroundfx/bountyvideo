The services sector in New Zealand continued to expand in April, and at
a faster pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Monday with
a Performance of Services Index score of 61.2.

That's up sharply from 52.9 in March and it moves further above the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Among the individual components, sales (62.1), employment (60.8), new
orders (68.0) and stocks (56.5) all expanded, while supplier deliveries
(46.8) remained in contraction.

"The Achilles heel of the PSI remains supplier deliveries," said BNZ
Senior Economist Doug Steel. "Given supply issues obviously remain a
significant issue for many, especially when viewed alongside very strong
demand side indicators at present, it points to significant upwards
pressure on prices."
