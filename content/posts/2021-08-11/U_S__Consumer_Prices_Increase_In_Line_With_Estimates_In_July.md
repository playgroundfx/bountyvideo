Reflecting higher prices for shelter, food, energy, and new vehicles,
the Labor Department released a report on Wednesday showing consumer
prices in the U.S. increased in line with economist estimates in the
month of July.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index climbed by 0.5
percent in July after jumping by 0.9 percent in June.

Economists had expected consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent following
the advance in the previous month, which reflected the biggest increase
since June of 2008.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices rose by 0.3
percent in July after surging by 0.9 percent in June. Economists had
expected core prices to increase by 0.4 percent.
