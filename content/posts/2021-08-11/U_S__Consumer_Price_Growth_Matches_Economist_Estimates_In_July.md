Reflecting higher prices for shelter, food, energy, and new vehicles,
the Labor Department released a report on Wednesday showing consumer
prices in the U.S. increased in line with economist estimates in the
month of July.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index climbed by 0.5
percent in July after jumping by 0.9 percent in June.

Economists had expected consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent following
the advance in the previous month, which reflected the biggest increase
since June of 2008.

Compared to the same month a year ago, consumer prices in July were up
by 5.4 percent, unchanged from the annual rate of growth seen in June.
The pace of growth was expected to dip to 5.3 percent.

The monthly increase in consumer prices was partly due to a 1.6 percent
jump in energy prices along with a 0.7 percent advance in food prices.

Excluding the higher food and energy prices, core consumer prices rose
by 0.3 percent in July after surging by 0.9 percent in June. Economists
had expected core prices to increase by 0.4 percent.

Along with increases in prices for shelter and new vehicles, the uptick
in core prices reflected higher prices for recreation, medical care, and
personal care.

The annual rate of growth in core prices slowed to 4.3 percent in July
from 4.5 percent in June, matching economist estimates.

"We believe June marked the peak in the in the annual rate of inflation
as the strong base effects are subsiding and wholesale price increases
for used cars and trucks have moderated greatly," said Kathy Bostjancic,
Chief U.S. Financial Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "That said, price increases stemming from the reopening of
the [economy][1] and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks will keep the rate
of inflation elevated and sticky as supply/demand imbalances are only
gradually resolved."

Bostjancic shares the Federal Reserve's view that "this isn't the start
of an upward wage-price spiral" but still expects inflation to remain
persistently above 2 percent through 2022.

On Thursday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on producer price inflation in the month of July.

Economists currently expect producer prices to advance by 0.6 percent in
July after jumping by 1.0 percent in June.
