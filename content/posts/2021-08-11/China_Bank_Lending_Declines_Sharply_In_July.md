China's bank lending declined sharply in July, the People's Bank of
China said on Wednesday.

Banks extended CNY 1.08 trillion in new yuan loans in July. This was
well below June's CNY 2.12 trillion lending and economists' forecast of
CNY 1.2 trillion.

Total social financing decreased notably to CNY 1.06 trillion compared
to CNY 3.67 trillion in June. The expected level was CNY 1.7 trillion.

The M2 broad money supply expanded 8.3 percent annually, following
June's 8.6 percent increase. The M2 was forecast to advance 8.7 percent.

July's reserve requirement ratio cut points to relaunched efforts by the
PBoC to push down borrowing costs and further RRR and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate cuts
are expected to follow, Sheana Yue and Mark Williams, economists at
Capital Economics, said. But credit growth is unlikely to rebound.

Indeed, the PBoC's reported mandate for banks to cap new lending for
2021 at last year's levels would require a further pullback in loan
growth over the rest of the year, the economists noted.
