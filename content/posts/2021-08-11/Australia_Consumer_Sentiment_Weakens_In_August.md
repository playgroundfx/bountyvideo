Australia's consumer confidence weakened in August as the spread of the
[coronavirus][1] situation locally is weighing on expectations, survey
data from Westpac showed on Wednesday.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment fell 4.4
percent to 104.1 in August from 108.8 in July. This was the lowest point
in a year but remained in positive territory, even in parts of the
country facing the biggest virus challenges.  
  
The availability of effective COVID vaccines is a key source of support
for confidence.

All index components recorded declines in August with the biggest falls
around expectations for the [economy][2] over the year ahead and
assessments of 'time to buy a major item'.

The 'economy, next 12 months' sub-index dropped 8.3 percent to 100.4 in
August. The medium term view on the economy was less affected, the
'economy, next five years' sub-index down just 1.2 percent to 109.2.

Around family finances, consumers were understandably less confident
about the year ahead, the 'finances, next 12 months' sub-index retracing
2.7 percent to 107. The 'finances vs a year ago' sub-index recorded a
milder 1.9 percent decline to 91.9.

The 'time to buy a major item' sub-index posted a sharp 7.2 percent drop
to 112 in August.

The Westpac Melbourne Institute Index of Unemployment Expectations rose
sharply, rising 13.7 points to 124.6. At the same time, the House Price
Expectations indicator declined 1.6 percent in the month but was still
at a very elevated level at 155.8.

Matthew Hassan, a senior economist at Westpac said the central case
remains that widespread vaccination will see a reopening recovery
underway by the November Board meeting, meaning this will still be an
appropriate time for the Reserve Bank to start scaling back its bond
purchases.
