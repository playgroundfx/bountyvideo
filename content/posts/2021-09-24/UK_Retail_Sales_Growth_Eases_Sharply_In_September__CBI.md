UK retail sales grew at the slowest pace in six months in September, the
latest Distributive Trades Survey data from the Confederation of British
Industry showed on Friday.

The retail sales balance plunged to +60 percent in September from +11
percent in August. This was also below the expected level of 35 percent.
Nonetheless, a net 29 percent forecast sales to improve next month.

Similarly, the retail order book balance declined sharply to 20 percent
from 68 percent in August. A balance of 24 percent expected orders to
rise in October.

Further, internet sales growth eased in the year to September and has
been below the long-run average for five consecutive months, with a
similar pace of growth expected in the year to October, the survey
showed.
