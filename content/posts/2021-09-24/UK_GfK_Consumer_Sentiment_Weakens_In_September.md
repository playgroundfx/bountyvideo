UK consumer confidence weakened to a five-month low in September as
consumers were concerned about personal financial situation as well as
wider economic prospects, survey results from the market research group
GfK showed on Friday.

The consumer confidence index fell to -13 from -8 in August. This was
the lowest reading since April 2021, when the score was -15.

All five components of the index deteriorated in September. The index
measuring past personal finances dropped four points to -4. Likewise,
the forecast for future personal finances decreased six points to +5.

The measure for the general economic situation over the last twelve
months was down one point at -43. At the same time, expectations for the
general economic situation over the coming year plunged ten points to
-16.

The Major Purchase Index slid three points to -6 in September. The
savings index decreased three points to +22.

"On the back of concerns about rising prices for fuel and food, the
growth in headline inflation, tax hikes, empty shelves and the end of
the furlough scheme, September sees consumers slamming on the brakes as
those already in economic hardship anticipate a potential cost of living
crisis," Joe Staton, client strategy director GfK, said.
