Lithuania's producer prices declined for the fifth month in a row in
June, though at a softer pace, figures from Statistics Lithuania showed
on Friday.

The producer price index decreased 11.4 percent year-on-year in June,
following an 16.1 percent decrease in May.

The decline in prices was mainly due to an increase in prices for
refined petroleum products and a decrease in wood and wood products
prices, the agency said.

Excluding refined petroleum products, producer prices fell 3.4 percent
annually in June, following a 3.7 percent decline in the preceding
month.

Producer prices for products sold on the Lithuanian market decreased by
7.7 percent annually in June. Prices for products sold on the foreign
market fell by 13.8 percent from a year ago.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices grew 2.7 percent in June,
after remaining unchanged in the prior month.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the trade balance
logged a surplus of EUR 2.7 million in May versus a deficit of EUR 474.9
million in the last year.

In April, the trade surplus was EUR 34.8 million.

Exports declined 21.8 percent yearly in May, following a 20.1 percent
fall in April.

Imports decreased 34.4 percent annually in May, following a 28.6 percent
fall in the preceding month.
