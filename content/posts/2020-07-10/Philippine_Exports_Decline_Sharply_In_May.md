The Philippine exports and imports declined sharply in May, the
Philippine Statistics Authority said Friday.

Exports decreased 35.6 percent year-on-year in May, but slower than the
49.9 percent fall logged in April.

At the same time, imports were down 40.6 percent, after declining 65.3
percent in April.

Consequently, the trade balance showed a shortfall of $1.86 billion in
May versus a $448.7 million deficit posted in April. In the same period
last year, the deficit was $3.65 billion.

Data showed that shipments of electronic products continued to be the
country's biggest exports. However, exports of electronic products
declined 33.4 percent. Exports of other manufactured products plunged
50.6 percent.

Meanwhile, mineral products exports advanced 12.8 percent and exports of
machinery and transport equipment grew 4.2 percent.
