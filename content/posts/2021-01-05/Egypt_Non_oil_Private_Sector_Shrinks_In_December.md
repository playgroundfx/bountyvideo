Egypt's non-oil private sector activity deteriorated in December, amid a
fall in output and new orders, data from IHS Markit revealed on Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 48.2 in December from
50.9 in November. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the
sector.

The latest reading ended a three-month upturn in the [economy][1] that
followed a sharp downturn caused by the pandemic, IHS Markit said.

Business activity declined in December, as sales dropped due to a rise
in Covid-19 cases. Output and sales declined at a softer pace.

Input stocks decreased in December, as the volume of inventories rose at
the quickest rate for eight-and-a-half years.

Backlogs of work remained unchanged for the first time in eight months
in December and led to a fastest decline in number of workforce.

On the price front, selling prices rose slightly in December, albeit at
a softer pace. Some firms reduced their charges to attract new
customers.

The outlook for the next 12 months increased in December. Optimism
increased as Covid-19 vaccines distribution began.

"The decline in sales was a surprise to those firms that made additional
purchases earlier in the fourth quarter, as stocks of unused inputs
built up at the quickest rate since mid-2012," David Owen, economist at
IHS Markit, said.
