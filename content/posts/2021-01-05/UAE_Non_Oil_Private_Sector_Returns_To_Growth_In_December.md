The UAE non-oil private sector [economy][1] expanded for the first time
since September, buoyed by a faster upturn in sales and a strong
increase in export demand in December, survey results from IHS Markit
showed Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.2 in December from 49.5 in
November. A score above 50 indicates expansion.

Despite rising to its highest level for 16 months, the rate of growth
signaled by the index was only mild.

Output levels returned to growth territory and new [business][2] grew at
a more marked pace in December. At the same time, employment numbers
continued to fall.

Cost pressures remained subdued at the end of the year. Businesses
lowered their selling charges further in an effort to compete for
clients, although the rate of discounting eased to the softest since
May.

Finally, the outlook for the next 12 months of activity picked up only
slightly from November's record low.
