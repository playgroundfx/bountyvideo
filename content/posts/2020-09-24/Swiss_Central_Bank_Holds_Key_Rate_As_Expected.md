Switzerland's central bank maintained its expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance on Thursday to cushion the impact of the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic on economic activity and inflation.

The Swiss National Bank retained the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and interest on sight
deposits at the SNB at -0.75 percent, as widely expected.

As the Swiss franc is still highly valued, the SNB said it is willing to
intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market, while taking the
overall exchange rate situation into consideration.

The central bank observed that the outlook to inflation is subject to
unusually high uncertainty.

Consumer prices are forecast to fall 0.6 percent this year. Inflation is
expected to turn positive next year, to 0.1 percent and increase
slightly further to 0.2 percent in 2022.

The [economy][2] experienced a sharp recession due to the coronavirus
pandemic. GDP is set to shrink by around 5 percent this year.

The economic activity picked up since May following the relaxation of
[health][3] [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures. This should be reflected in a strong rise
in the third quarter GDP. The positive development is likely to continue
in 2021, the bank said.
