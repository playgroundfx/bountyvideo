Turkey's central bank lifted its interest rates unexpectedly by 200
basis points in an attempt to curb the weakness in the lira exchange
rate.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, led by Governor Murat Uysal, decided to lift the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate,
which is the one-week repo auction rate, to 10.25 percent from 8.25
percent.

This was the first hike in two years. The bank had reduced the rate four
times this year by a cumulative 375 basis points.

"As a result of fast economic recovery with strong credit momentum, and
financial market developments inflation followed a higher-than-envisaged
path," the bank said.

Policymakers said the tightening measures taken since August should be
reinforced to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation
outlook. The committee assessed that the rate increase is needed to
restore the disinflation process and support price stability.

The move gives the central bank more room to tighten monetary conditions
through its interest rate 'corridor' and the average cost of central
bank liquidity provision is likely to climb to around 12 percent by
year-end from the current 10.7 percent, Jason Tuvey, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

The real test, of course, is whether the central bank backs up today's
decision with further steps to improve its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)making credibility, the
economist observed.  
Additional tightening at the next few meetings, with a pledge to stick
to a single [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and a commitment to keep real interest rates
positive for a prolonged period, would be ideal.
