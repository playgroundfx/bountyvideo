UK retail sales grew at the fastest pace since April 2019 with a surge
in grocery sales, the Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation
of British Industry showed Thursday.

The retail sales balance rose unexpectedly to +11 percent in September
from -6 percent in August. The balance was forecast to fall to -10
percent.

Respondents forecast retail sales to remain flat in October.  
  
"The latest results suggest that the recovery in retail spending over
the summer months has continued into September, which is welcome [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/),
but retailers appear cautious over the near-term outlook," Ben Jones,
CBI principal economist, said.

Annual internet sales growth slowed to below the long-run average, with
the balance falling to +35 percent from +46 percent. Growth is expected
to ease a little further next month as the balance dropped to +31
percent.
