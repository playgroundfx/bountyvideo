German [business][1] confidence improved to a seven-month high in
September as the economy showed signs of stabilization despite rising
number of coronavirus infection, survey results from the ifo Institute
showed Thursday.

The business confidence index rose to 93.4 in September from 92.5 in
August. This was the highest reading since February but was slightly
below economists' forecast of 93.8.

The very small increase in the business confidence for September is
further evidence that the recovery has run out of steam, Andrew
Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Germany's export-oriented manufacturing sector is still expanding but
this is likely to be offset by renewed weakness in the services sector,
the economist noted.  
  
Companies assessed their current situation as better than in the
previous month and they expect situation to recover further, the ifo
survey showed.

The current conditions index climbed to 89.2 from 87.9 in the previous
month. The expected reading was 89.5.

Similarly, the expectations index rose to 97.7 in September from 97.2 a
month ago. Economists had forecast the reading to climb to 98.0.  
  
In manufacturing, business confidence logged a noticeable increase as
significantly fewer companies assessed their current business situation
as difficult and more industrial companies expected that their business
situation to improve further in the near future.

In the service sector, business confidence weakened after rising four
times in a row. This was due to less optimistic expectations.

In trade, the business climate brightened considerably. Companies were
considerably more satisfied with their current business situation, and
many of them assume it will improve further over the months ahead.

Business confidence in construction also improved in September. The
indicator for the current situation climbed to its highest value since
last March. Although the outlook remains pessimistic, it is somewhat
less so than in August.
