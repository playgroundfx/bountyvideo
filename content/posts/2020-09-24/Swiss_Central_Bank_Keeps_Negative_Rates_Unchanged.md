Switzerland's central bank retained its negative interest rates as
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed that the expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance is
needed to cushion the impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic on
economic activity and inflation.

The Swiss National Bank retained the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and interest on sight
deposits at the SNB at a record low -0.75 percent, as widely expected.

As the Swiss franc is still highly valued, the SNB said it is willing to
'intervene more strongly' in the foreign exchange market, while taking
the overall exchange rate situation into consideration.

The central bank continued to supply the banking system with generous
amounts of liquidity via the SNB COVID-19 refinancing facility, or CRF.
It was also active on the repo market as needed, the bank said.

Looking ahead, FX interventions are set to remain the SNB's weapon of
choice to fend off bouts of upwards pressure on the currency, David
Oxley, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The SNB is expected to leave rates on hold at -0.75 percent throughout
the forecast horizon and, in all probability, until at least later this
decade, the economist added.

The central bank observed that the outlook to inflation is subject to
unusually high uncertainty.

Consumer price are forecast to fall 0.6 percent this year compared to
-0.7 percent decline estimated in June. Inflation is expected to turn
positive next year, to 0.1 percent and increase slightly further to 0.2
percent in 2022.

The [economy][2] experienced a sharp recession due to the coronavirus
pandemic. GDP is set to shrink by around 5 percent this year, which was
better than the previous forecast of -6 percent.

The economic activity picked up since May following the relaxation of
[health][3] [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures. This should be reflected in a strong rise
in the third quarter GDP. The positive development is likely to continue
in 2021, the bank said.
