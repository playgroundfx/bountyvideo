Italy's surplus in the merchandise trade with countries outside the
European Union increased in August as imports declined faster than
exports, preliminary data from ISTAT showed on Thursday.

The non-EU foreign trade surplus grew to EUR 3.272 billion from EUR
3.039 billion in the same month last year.

Exports decreased 11.7 percent year-on-year following an 8.1 percent
fall in July. Imports dropped 16.4 percent after a 17.5 percent slump in
the previous month.

Compared to the previous month, exports fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3
percent after a 7.3 percent gain in July. The decline was the first in
four months.

Imports grew 5.1 percent monthly, marking the third month of increase.

Excluding energy, the non-EU trade surplus shrunk to EUR 4.882 billion
from EUR 6.220 billion in the same month last year.
