Norway's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at zero, as
widely expected, on Thursday.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee unanimously
decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at zero percent, Norges Bank said in a
statement.

In May, the interest rate was reduced from 0.25 percent after a
cumulative 125 basis points reduction in two extraordinary sessions in
March from 1.50 percent.

"The sharp economic downturn and considerable uncertainty surrounding
the outlook suggest keeping the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate on hold until there are
clear signs that economic conditions are normalising", Governor Ã˜ystein
Olsen, said.

The bank repeated that the interest rate will remain at the current
level over the next couple of years, followed by a gradual rise as
activity approaches a more normal level.

Policymakers observed that the increase in the [coronavirus][1]
infection rates may put a brake on the upswing in economic activity in
the coming period. It will take time for output and employment to return
to pre-pandemic levels, the committee noted.

Underlying inflation remained above the target, but the krone
appreciation since March and prospects for low wage growth suggest that
it will moderate, the bank said.

The central bank is likely to raise the countercyclical capital buffer
before it touches interest rates, possibly as soon as early next year,
David Oxley, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
