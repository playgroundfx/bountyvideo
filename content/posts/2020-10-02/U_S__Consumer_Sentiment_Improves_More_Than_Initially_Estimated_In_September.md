Revised data released by the University of Michigan on Friday showed
consumer sentiment in the U.S. improve by more than previously estimated
in the month of September.

The report said the consumer sentiment index for September was upwardly
revised to 80.4 from the preliminary reading of 78.9. Economists had
expected the index to be upwardly revised to 79.0.

With the bigger than expected upward revision, the consumer sentiment
index is well above the final August reading of 74.1.

"Consumer sentiment continued to improve in late September, with the
Sentiment Index reaching its highest level in six months," said Surveys
of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin. "The gains were mainly due
to a more optimistic outlook for the national [economy][1].

"While consumers have anticipated gains in the national economy ever
since the April shutdown, the September survey recorded a significant
increase in the proportion that expected a reestablishment of good times
financially in the overall economy," he added.

Curtin called the recent gains encouraging but noted they were largely
due to upper income households, with data indicating lower income
households face continued income and job losses.

The report showed the index of consumer expectations for September was
upwardly revised to 75.6 from 73.3. The index came in at 68.5 in August.

The current economic conditions index for September ticked up to 87.8
from the preliminary reading of 87.5 and compares to a reading of 82.9
in the previous month.

On the inflation front, the report said one-year inflations expectations
tumbled to 2.6 percent in September from 3.1 percent in August, while
five-year inflation expectations were unchanged at 2.7 percent.

The Conference Board released a separate report on Tuesday showing a
much bigger than expected increase its reading on consumer confidence in
the month of September.

The report said the consumer confidence index jumped to 101.8 in
September from 86.3 in August, while economists had expected the index
to rise to 88.8.
