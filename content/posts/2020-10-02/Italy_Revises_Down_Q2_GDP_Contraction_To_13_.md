Italy's record economic contraction in the second quarter, caused by the
impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, was more severe than estimated
earlier, revised figures from the statistical office ISTAT showed on
Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product shrunk 13 percent from the first quarter and 18
percent from a year ago, revised data showed.  
  
Earlier, ISTAT had reported the quarterly contraction at 12.8 percent
and the yearly decline at 17.7 percent.  
  
The Italian [economy][2] entered a severe recession after the government
introduced strict measures to contain the spread ofÂ coronavirus or
Covid-19.

Revised data showed that private consumption declined 8.5 percent
quarter-on-quarter and gross fixed capital formation fell 16.2 percent.

Imports and exports decreased 20.6 percent and 26.4 percent,
respectively.

The carry-over annual GDP growth for 2020 is equal to -14.8 percent,
ISTAT said.
