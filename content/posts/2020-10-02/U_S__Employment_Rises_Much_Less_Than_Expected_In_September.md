Job growth in the U.S. slowed by much more than expected in the month of
September, according to a closely watched report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 661,000
jobs in September after spiking by an upwardly revised 1.489 million
jobs in August.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 850,000 jobs compared
to the jump of 1.371 million jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

Despite the weaker than expected job growth, the report said the
unemployment rate slid to 7.9 percent in September from 8.4 percent in
August. The unemployment rate was expected to dip to 8.2 percent.
