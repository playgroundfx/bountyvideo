UK house prices increased in January at the fastest pace since 2016 with
the highest ever number of Boxing Day sellers coming to the market and
the surge in the number of prospective buyers enquiries, data from the
property [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove showed on Monday.

House prices grew 7.6 percent on a yearly basis in January, following a
6.3 percent rise in December. This was the highest annual rate of price
growth recorded by Rightmove since May 2016.

On a monthly basis, house prices gained 0.3 percent in January, in
contrast to the 0.7 percent fall in December.

Asking prices traditionally see a rise in January, though this month's
figure is compared with an unusual drop in January last year as the rush
to beat the March stamp duty deadline started to abate, the property
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) said.

Data showed that first-time buyer asking prices hit a new record of GBP
214,176 after a monthly jump of 1.4 percent.

The number of buyers enquiring about homes was 15 percent higher than
the same time last year. At the same time, the number of available homes
for sale per estate agency branch dropped again to a new record low of
just 12.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove's Director of Property Data said, "It is clear
that the trends which defined the market in 2021 have carried over into
this year. That being said, we are seeing early signs of a better
balanced market in 2022."
