The Bank of Japan will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Tuesday
and then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a light
day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The BoJ is widely expected to
keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at -0.10 percent.

Japan also will see final November numbers for industrial production,
with forecasts suggesting an increase of 7.2 percent on month and 5.4
percent on year. That follows the 1.8 percent monthly increase and the
4.1 percent annual decline in October.

Hong Kong will provide December data for unemployment; in November, the
jobless rate was 4.1 percent.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Malaysia are closed on Tuesday in
observance of Thaipusam and will re-open on Wednesday.
