Ireland's construction sector expanded at a softer pace in December,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.7 in
December from 56.3 in November. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in
the sector.

"This is an unsurprising development following the signs of deceleration
also contained in the Manufacturing and Services PMI survey results for
December, which together indicate that high virus case numbers
contributed to some moderation of Irish economic growth momentum at the
end of the year," Simon Barry, chief economist at Ulster Bank, said.

All three broad categories of construction posted expansion in December,
albeit at a softer pace.

New order growth eased in December due to the emergence of the Omicron
variant of COVID-19 pandemic.

Firms remained confident for the next 12 months.

Employment increased for the ninth straight month in December and
purchasing activity rose at a softer pace.

Input cost inflation increased in December, despite easing from the
previous month.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in December.
