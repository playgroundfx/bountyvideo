China's [economy][1] grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter of 2021
amid weak property investment and new restrictions imposed at the end of
the year to control the spread of coronavirus.

As the economy registered a slower growth, the central bank lowered its
lending rates for the first time since 2020 and boosted liquidity.

In the fourth quarter, gross domestic product grew 4.0 percent on a
yearly basis, slower than the 4.9 percent expansion posted in the
preceding quarter, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed
Monday. However, the pace of growth was bigger than the economists'
forecast of 3.6 percent.  
  
On a quarterly basis, GDP advanced 1.6 percent versus the expected
growth of 1.1 percent.

In the whole year of 2021, the economy logged a strong growth of 8.1
percent, better than the government's target of above 6 percent.
However, the faster growth reflects the low base of comparison. GDP had
increased 2.2 percent in 2020.

Data showed that industrial production advanced 4.3 percent in December
from the last year, which was bigger than the expected growth of 3.6
percent.

On the other hand, retail sales moved up only 1.7 percent and remained
weaker than the expected increase of 3.7 percent.

In 2021, fixed asset investment gained 4.9 percent compared to the
economists' forecast of 4.8 percent. At the same time, property
investment was up 4.4 percent.

The unemployment rate rose marginally to 5.1 percent in December from
5.0 percent in the previous month.

The People's Bank of China on Monday lowered the one-year medium lending
facility rate to 2.85 percent from 2.95 percent and the 7-day reverse
repo rate to 2.10 percent from 2.20 percent.

Economic momentum remains weak amid repeated virus outbreaks and a
struggling property sector, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at
Capital Economics, said. As such, the economist anticipates another 20
basis point of cuts to PBoC [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates during the first half of this
year.

The upshot is that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing is likely to soften the economic
downturn rather than drive a rebound, the economist added.

Unless the global recovery is really slow, China will grow faster in
2022 than it did in the fourth quarter of 2021 with easier monetary and
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Iris Pang, an ING economist, said.
