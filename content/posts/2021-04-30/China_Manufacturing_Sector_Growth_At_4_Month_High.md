China's manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in four months in
April, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.9 in
April from an 11-month low of 50.6 in March. A score above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

Driven by improved market conditions and greater customer demand, total
new orders grew for the eleventh straight month in April.

Greater inflows of new work led goods producers in China to expand
production volumes again in April, with the rate of expansion also
improving to a four-month high.

The sustained increase in sales led to a further accumulation in
backlogs of work. Consequently, manufacturers added to their staff
numbers for the first time in five months.

Prices data showed a further rapid increase in input costs amid reports
of supplier price hikes. The latest increase in expenses was the
quickest since November 2017.  
Companies often passed on higher costs to customers through higher
factory gate charges, which rose sharply overall.

Output expectations remained markedly upbeat in April, though the level
of positive sentiment edging down to a three-month low.

"Policymakers have expressed concerns about rising commodity prices on
several occasions and urged adjusting raw material [markets][1] and
easing businesses' cost pressure," Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin
Insight Group said.

In the coming months, rising raw material prices and imported inflation
are expected to limit [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) choices and become a major obstacle to the
sustained economic recovery, Wang added.
