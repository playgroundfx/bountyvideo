The French [economy][1] recovered at a faster-than-expected pace in the
first quarter underpinned by consumption and investment, first estimate
from the statistical office Insee showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent sequentially, reversing a
revised 1.4 percent fall in the fourth quarter of 2020 and exceeded the
economists' forecast of +0.1 percent.

Nonetheless, the statistical office said the economic rebound was
limited, as GDP was still 4.4 percent below its fourth quarter 2019
level.

The expenditure-side breakdown of GDP showed that growth in gross fixed
capital formation improved to 2.2 percent from 1.3 percent and
households' consumption expenditure picked up 0.3 percent, in contrast
to a fall of 5.7 percent in the previous quarter.

Final internal demand, excluding inventory changes made a positive
contribution of 0.9 points to GDP growth.

Exports declined 1.5 percent and imports decreased 0.1 percent. Overall,
foreign trade made a negative contribution to GDP growth by -0.4 points
versus +1.2 points in the previous quarter.

Finally, the contribution of inventory changes to the growth of the GDP
was null this quarter, data showed.

Early this month, the finance ministry cut its 2021 GDP growth forecast
to 5 percent from 6 percent after the government extended the
restrictions related to the [coronavirus][2] pandemic.
