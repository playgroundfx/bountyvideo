Switzerland's retail sales increased sharply in March, preliminary data
from the Federal Statistical Office showed on Friday.

Retail sales adjusted for sales days and holidays grew by 22.6 percent
year-on-year in March.

Sales of food, beverages and tobacco gained 8.5 percent yearly in March
and those of non-food sector surged 41.1 percent.

Sales of other household equipment, textiles, DIY and furniture
increased 90.1 percent and those of information and communication
equipment rose 42.8 percent. Sales of other goods, and culture and
recreation goods grew by 31.9 percent and 29.4 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, seasonally adjusted retail sales rose 22.1 percent
in March.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales increased 21.5 percent annually in March
and gained 21.9 percent from a month ago.

The latest growth was mainly due to the low value of March 2020 when the
Covid-19 pandemic first began to filter through, the agency said.
