Taiwan's economic growth accelerated at the fastest pace in more than a
decade in the first quarter, driven by strong global demand for
electronic parts, the advance estimates from the Directorate-General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics showed on Friday.

Real gross domestic product grew 8.16 percent on a yearly basis in the
first quarter, faster than the 5.09 percent increase in the fourth
quarter and the economists' forecast of +6.1 percent.

This was the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2010, when GDP
was up 11.54 percent.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualized basis, GDP growth
advanced to 12.93 percent from 5.84 percent.

The expenditure-side of GDP showed that private consumption and
government spending grew 2.08 percent and 4.32 percent, respectively.
Gross capital formation surged 8.29 percent.

Driven by the strong foreign demand for electronic parts and ICT
products, exports grew sharply by 19.27 percent. Imports were up 14.63
percent.

Surging demand for semiconductors and booming investment mean growth
should remain strong over the coming quarters, Gareth Leather, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

The [economy][1] still depends very much on exports and mainly on
electronic exports, Iris Pang, an ING economist said. This poses an
imminent risk to the economy.
