Reflecting the distribution of another round of stimulus checks, the
Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing U.S. personal
income skyrocketed in the month of March.

The Commerce Department said personal income soared by 21.1 percent in
March after plunging by a revised 7.0 percent in February.

Economists had expected personal income to spike by 20.3 percent
compared to the 7.1 percent slump originally reported for the previous
month.

The report also showed personal spending jumped by 4.2 percent in March
following a 1.0 percent decrease in February. Personal spending was
expected to surge up by 4.1 percent.
