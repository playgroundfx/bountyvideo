The euro area [economy][1] slipped back into recession in the first
quarter as restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic
dampened economic activity, the preliminary flash estimate published by
Eurostat, showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product contracted 0.6 percent from the fourth quarter,
when GDP was down 0.7 percent. GDP was forecast to drop at a faster pace
of 0.8 percent.

After a record expansion in the third quarter of 2020, GDP had fallen
for the second straight time, pushing the economy back into a technical
recession.

On a yearly basis, GDP fell 1.8 percent in the first quarter, but slower
than the 4.9 percent decrease seen in the fourth quarter.

The EU27 GDP shrank 0.4 percent sequentially in the first three months
of 2021 and by 1.7 percent from the last year.

Eurostat reported that the annual growth rates were negative for all EU
countries except for France and Lithuania.

Germany's GDP contracted in the first quarter after recovering slightly
in the second half of 2020. GDP fell 1.7 percent sequentially, in
contrast to the 0.5 percent growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Meanwhile, underpinned by consumption and investment, the French economy
recovered at a faster-than-expected pace in the first quarter. GDP was
up 0.4 percent, reversing a revised 1.4 percent fall in the fourth
quarter and bigger than economists' forecast of +0.1 percent.

Spain's economic output decreased 0.5 percent in the first quarter after
stagnating in the previous three months. Likewise, Italy's GDP fell 0.4
percent following a 1.8 percent decline in the fourth quarter.

Another report from Eurostat showed that the jobless rate in the
currency bloc fell unexpectedly to 8.1 percent in March from 8.2 percent
in February. The expected rate was 8.3 percent.

The number of people out of work decreased by 209,000 from the previous
month to 13.166 million in March. Compared with last year, unemployment
rose by 1.614 million.

The unemployment rate among youth aged below 25 came in at 17.2 percent,
down from 17.3 percent a month ago.
