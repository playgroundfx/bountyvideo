Austria's [economy][1] grew in the first quarter of this year, driven by
growth in construction and industry that offset the slump in the
services sector due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Gross domestic product grew 0.2 percent from the previous quarter, when
output fell 2.7 percent, preliminary estimates from the Austrian
Institute for Economic Research, or WIFO, showed Friday. Economists had
expected a 1.2 percent declined.

In the first quarter of 2020, output decreased 3.0 percent as the
[coronavirus][2] pandemic began impacting economic activity across the
world.

Private consumption dropped 0.2 percent, while investments grew 1.7
percent. Exports and imports declined 1.0 percent and 1.5 percent,
respectively.

On a year-on-year basis, the economy shrank 2.7 percent after a 5.9
percent slump in the previous quarter.
