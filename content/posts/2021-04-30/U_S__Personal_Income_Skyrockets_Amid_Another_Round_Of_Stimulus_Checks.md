Reflecting the distribution of another round of stimulus checks, the
Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing U.S. personal
income skyrocketed in the month of March.

The Commerce Department said personal income soared by 21.1 percent in
March after plunging by a revised 7.0 percent in February.

Economists had expected personal income to spike by 20.3 percent
compared to the 7.1 percent slump originally reported for the previous
month.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, also shot up by 23.6 percent in March after tumbling by 7.9
percent in February.

The report also showed personal spending jumped by 4.2 percent in March
following a 1.0 percent decrease in February. Personal spending was
expected to surge up by 4.1 percent.

Excluding price changes, personal spending advanced by 3.6 percent in
March after slumping by 1.2 percent in the previous month.

With income spiking by much more than spending, personal saving as a
percentage of disposable personal income soared to 27.6 percent in March
from 13.9 percent in February.

"The strong consumer showing at the end of Q1 sets the tone for a summer
boom," said Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics. "As
[health][1] conditions improve and the [economy][2] reopens, generous
fiscal stimulus, rebounding employment and rising optimism will help
unleash pent-up demand.

He added, "We foresee real consumption growth above 9% this year - the
strongest performance since 1946 - and excess savings should help smooth
spending into 2022."

Meanwhile, a reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal
Reserve showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth accelerated
to 1.8 percent in March from 1.4 percent in February.
