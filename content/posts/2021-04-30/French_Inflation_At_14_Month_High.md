France's inflation rose to a 14-month high in April on higher energy and
services prices, preliminary data from the statistical office Insee
showed on Friday.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office showed that household
consumption declined sharply in March due to the significant fall in
manufactured goods purchases.

Consumer price inflation rose to 1.3 percent in April, as expected, from
1.1 percent in March. This was the highest since February 2020, when the
rate was 1.4 percent.

The increase resulted from the acceleration of the service prices and
those of energy. Services cost gained 1.3 percent and energy prices grew
8.8 percent. Meanwhile, food prices were down 0.3 percent.

Month-on-month, consumer prices climbed 0.2 percent but weaker than the
March's 0.6 percent increase. Monthly inflation also matched economists'
expectations.

On a yearly basis, inflation based on the harmonized index of consumer
prices advanced to 1.7 percent from 1.4 percent in March. The rate was
forecast to climb to 1.6 percent.

The HICP grew 0.3 percent on month versus the 0.7 percent rise in the
previous month. The expected rate was 0.1 percent. Final data is due on
May 12.

Another report from the Insee showed that the producer prices for the
home market sped up sharply to 4.5 percent annually in March from 1.9
percent in February.

On a monthly basis, producer prices increased 1.0 percent versus a 0.9
percent rise in the previous month.

Household spending decreased unexpectedly by 1.1 percent on month in
March, in contrast to a 0.3 percent rise in February and economists'
forecast of +0.4 percent.

The decline was largely driven by a 3.7 percent fall in manufactured
goods purchases. Meanwhile, energy spending grew 1.3 percent and food
consumption rose 0.8 percent.
