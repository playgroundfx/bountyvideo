The Czech Republic's economic output shrank in the first three months of
this year, following growth in the previous two quarters, amid a
resurgence in the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

Gross domestic product decreased 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter after a
0.6 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, preliminary
estimates from the statistical office showed Friday. Economists had
forecast 1.0 percent decline.

In the first quarter of 2020, the [economy][2] shrank 3.1 percent as the
coronavirus pandemic started impacting economic activity across the
world.

On a year-on-year basis, GDP fell 2.1 percent in the first quarter after
a 4.8 percent fall in the previous three months. Economists had expected
a 2.6 percent drop.

The negative year-on-year development of GDP was influenced mainly by
continuously decreasing finalÂ consumption expenditure of households, the
statistical office said.  
  
Meanwhile, positive contribution came from the final consumption
expenditure of general government and external demand.

Employment grew 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter and fell 1.6 percent from
the same quarter last year.
