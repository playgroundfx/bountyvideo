Portugal's economic output decreased in the first quarter of this year,
after two quarters of growth, amid a resurgence in the [coronavirus][1]
infections across Europe.

Gross domestic product decreased 3.3 percent year-on-year after a 0.2
percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, Statistics Portugal said
Friday.

In the third quarter, the [economy][2] had grown 13.4 percent, nearly
erasing the slump caused by the pandemic in the first two quarters of
last year.

On a year-on-year basis, GDP decreased 5.4 percent in the first quarter
of this year following a 6.1 percent fall in the previous three months.

The decline in economic output reflects the effects of the general
confinement enacted earlier this year due to the deterioration of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the statistical office said.
