Hungary's consumer prices increased at a steady pace in May, the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office reported Wednesday.

Another report from the statistical office showed that the trade surplus
declined to a 9-month low in April.

Consumer prices grew 5.1 percent year-on-year in May, the same rate as
seen in April. The rate was expected to rise to 5.3 percent.

Food prices advanced 2.6 percent and alcoholic beverages and tobacco
prices climbed 12.2 percent. Motor fuel prices became 36.2 percent
higher.

On a monthly basis, inflation eased to 0.5 percent from 0.8 percent in
the previous month.

The trade surplus fell to EUR 321 million from EUR 876 million a month
ago, the statistical office said in a separate report. This was the
lowest level since July 2020.

The value of exports was 73.3 percent and that of imports 52.3 percent
larger in April than the base in the same period of the previous year.
