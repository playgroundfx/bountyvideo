Following last week's much better than expected monthly jobs report, the
Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing first-time claims
for U.S. unemployment benefits fell to a four-month low in the week
ended March 6th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims dropped to 712,000, a
decrease of 42,000 from the previous week's revised level of 754,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 725,000 from the
745,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims fell to their
lowest level since hitting 711,000 in the week ended November 7th.

The report showed the less volatile four-week moving average also slid
to 759,000, a decrease of 34,000 from the previous week's revised
average of 793,000.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also declined by 193,000 to 4.144 million in
the week ended February 27th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims dropped to 4,355,000,
a decrease of 103,500 from the previous week's revised average of
4,458,500.

Despite the decrease in regular state jobless benefits, Nancy Vanden
Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics, noted combined claims for
regular and emergency benefits were stuck at 1.2 million.

"The February jobs report confirmed a labor market recovery is underway,
but showed that employment remains 9.5 million below pre-pandemic
levels," Vanden Houten said.

She added, "That shortfall, along with the elevated level of claims,
reminds us that the healing of the labor market will take time."

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a more closely watched report
showing much stronger than expected U.S. job growth in the month of
February.

The report said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 379,000 jobs in
February after climbing by an upwardly revised 166,000 jobs in January.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 182,000 jobs compared
to the uptick of 49,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The stronger than expected job growth was primarily due to a rebound in
employment in the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 355,000
jobs.

The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly edged
down to 6.2 percent in February from 6.3 percent in January. Economists
had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.
