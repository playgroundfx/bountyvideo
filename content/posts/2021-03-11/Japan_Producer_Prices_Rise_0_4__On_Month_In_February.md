Producer prices in Japan were up 0.4 percent on month in February, the
Bank of Japan said on Thursday.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 0.5 percent and was
unchanged from the January reading.

On a yearly basis, producer prices sank 0.7 percent - in line with
expectations following the 1.6 percent decline in the previous month.

Export prices were up 1.4 percent on month and 0.3 percent on year, the
bank said, while import prices jumped 4.1 percent on month but lost 3.5
percent on year.
