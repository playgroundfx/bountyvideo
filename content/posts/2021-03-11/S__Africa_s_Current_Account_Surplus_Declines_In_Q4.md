South Africa's current account surplus declined in the fourth quarter,
but was the second biggest on record, South African Reserve Bank said
Thursday.

The current account surplus came in at ZAR 197.8 billion compared to ZAR
294.4 billion a quarter ago. This was the second highest ever recorded.

As a ratio of gross domestic product, the current account surplus
narrowed to 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter from 5.9 percent a quarter
ago.

On an annual basis, the ratio switched to a surplus of 2.2 percent in
2020 from a deficit of 3.0 percent in 2019.

The trade surplus narrowed somewhat to ZAR 425.2 billion in the fourth
quarter from ZAR 450.9 billion in the preceding quarter.

At the same time, the shortfall on the services, income and current
transfer account widened substantially to ZAR 227.4 billion from ZAR
156.4 billion.
