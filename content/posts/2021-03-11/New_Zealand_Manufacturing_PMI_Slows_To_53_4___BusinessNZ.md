The manufacturing sector in New Zealand continued to expand in February,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on
Friday with a Performance of Manufacturing Index score of 53.4.

That's down from the upwardly revised 58.0 in January (originally 57.5),
although it remains above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates
expansion from contraction.

Among the individual components, production (57.3), new orders (56.2)
and finished stocks (51.2) expanded, while deliveries (47.6) and
employment (49.8) contracted.

"Despite the PMI remaining in expansion, the proportion of those
outlining negative comments stood at 54 percent, compared with 46
percent in January," said BusinessNZ Executive Director for
Manufacturing Catherine Beard. "Given the second recent partial
lockdown, it remains to be seen what impact this will have on the sector
over the next few months."
