Estonia's trade deficit increased in January, figures from Statistics
Estonia showed on Thursday.

The trade deficit rose to EUR 118 million in January from EUR 17 million
in the same month last year. In December, the trade deficit was EUR
127.9 million.

Exports grew 4.0 percent year-on-year in January and imports gained 13.0
percent.

"In January the primary contributor to foreign trade was increased trade
in oil products and mineral fuels, which was partially caused by higher
prices of crude oil on the world market," Evelin Puura, leading analyst
at Statistics Estonia, said.
