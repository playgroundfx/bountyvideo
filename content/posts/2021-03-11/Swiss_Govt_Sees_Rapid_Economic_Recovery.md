After contracting in the first quarter, the Swiss [economy][1] is set to
recover at a rapid pace with the easing of coronavirus measures, the
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, said Thursday.

Gross domestic product is forecast to grow 3 percent in 2021 and 3.3
percent next year. The projection for this year was left unchanged,
while that for 2022 was revised up from 3.1 percent.

The economy is expected to shrink significantly in the first quarter of
this year. However, a collapse of a similar magnitude to last spring so
far seems unlikely, the SECO said.

The expert group cautioned that the recovery would be noticeably delayed
if in the coming months further strict containment measures were to be
introduced domestically and by key trade partners.  
  
The SECO expects consumer prices to climb 0.4 percent in 2021 instead of
0.1 percent estimated previously. Similarly, the projection for 2022 was
raised to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent.

Employment is forecast to rise considerably as the economy recovers, and
unemployment is set to fall. The government maintained its outlook for
the unemployment rate. The jobless rate is seen at 3.3 percent this year
and 3 percent next year.
