South Africa's manufacturing output declined in January after falling in
the previous month, data from Statistics South Africa showed on
Thursday.

Manufacturing output declined 3.4 percent year-on-year in January, after
a 1.9 percent growth in December.

The largest negative contributions came from petroleum, chemical
products, rubber and plastic products, food and beverages, and furniture
and 'other' manufacturing

On a month-on-month basis, manufacturing output increased 0.5 percent in
January, following a 0.6 percent rise in the preceding month. This was
in line with economists' expectation.

During the three months ended in January, manufacturing output gained
2.2 percent, after a 5.3 percent increase in the preceding period.
