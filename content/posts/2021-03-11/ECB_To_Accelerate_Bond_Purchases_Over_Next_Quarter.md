The European Central Bank said Thursday that it will step up its
emergency bond purchases over the next quarter based on market
conditions and left its key interest rates unchanged.  
  
The Governing Council, led by ECB President Christine Lagarde, left the
size of the pandemic emergency purchase program, or PEPP, unchanged at
EUR 1,850 billion and said these will continue until at least the end of
March 2022 or when the [coronavirus][1] crisis phase is over.  
  
"Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation
outlook, the Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP over the
next quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during
the first months of this year," the bank said.  
  
"The Governing Council will purchase flexibly according to market
conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing
conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of
the pandemic on the projected path of inflation," the ECB added.  
  
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said market participants had started to
speculate whether and how the ECB would react to the recent increase in
bond yields and heating up of inflation fears.

The latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) statement suggests that the ECB is trying to
demonstrate its willingness to put a cap on bond yields without showing
signs of panic, the economist added.

In December, the PEPP envelope was boosted by EUR 500 billion and the
horizon for net purchases under the scheme was extended to at least the
end of March 2022.

The bank said it will not use the PEPP provision in full if favorable
financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do
not exhaust the envelope over its net purchase horizon.

The PEPP purchases can be reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted if required to maintain favorable
financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the
path of inflation, the ECB said.  
  
The bank will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing
securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. The
future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid
interference with the appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, the bank said.

The size of the asset purchase program was also maintained. The monthly
EUR 20 billion worth of asset purchases would continue as long as
necessary, the bank said.

These will end shortly before the Governing Council starts raising the
key ECB interest rates, the ECB said.

The Governing Council kept the main refi rate unchanged at a record low
zero percent and the deposit rate was left at -0.50 percent. The lending
rate was held steady at 0.25 percent.  
  
Policymakers retained its forward guidance on interest rates, saying it
expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower
levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a
level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent.

Reaffirming its commitment to provide ample liquidity, the ECB said the
third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTRO
III, remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank
lending to firms and households.

"The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as
appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a
sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry," the ECB
reiterated.
