China's automobile sales and production increased sharply in January to
February period, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, or
CAAM, reported Thursday.

Auto sales logged an annual growth of 76.2 percent in January to
February period. At the same time, production increased 88.9 percent
from the last year.

The increase was largely caused by the low base levels as both
production and sales declined amid the [coronavirus][1] epidemic last
year.

In February, auto production increased 4.2 times and sales grew 3.6
times, the agency said.

The industry association said the current market demand is still
recovering. Data showed that auto exports increased 97.8 percent to
224,000 units in January to February period.
