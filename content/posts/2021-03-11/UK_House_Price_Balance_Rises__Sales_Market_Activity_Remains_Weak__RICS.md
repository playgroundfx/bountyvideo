British house prices increased again in February but the current
lockdown restrictions weighed on the sales market activity, the
Residential Market Survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, or RICS, showed on Thursday.

The house price balance rose to 52 percent in February from 49 percent
in the previous month. Further, twelve month price expectations picked
up, with the net balance climbing to +46 percent from +30 percent in
January.

The net balance for new buyer enquiries came in at -9 percent in
February versus -29 percent in January.

Meanwhile, new instructions also fell for a second month in succession,
evidenced by a net balance of -29 percent of contributors reporting a
decline compared to -40 percent in January.

Looking ahead, near term sales expectations moved into marginally
positive territory at +6 percent, marking the strongest reading for this
series since October last year.
