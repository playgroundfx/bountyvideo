China's bank lending increased in August as the [economy][1] started to
recover from the coronavirus driven downturn, data from the People's
Bank of China revealed Friday.

Banks offered CNY 1.28 trillion loans in August. This was bigger than
the expected level of CNY 1.22 trillion and CNY 992.7 billion loans
provided in July.  
  
Total social financing, a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the
economy, surged to CNY 3.58 trillion from CNY 1.69 trillion in July.

The broad money supply M2 climbed 10.4 percent on year, slower than the
10.7 percent growth logged in July.

Iris Pang, an ING economist said the stimulus measures are in progress,
which includes traditional infrastructure stimulus and 5G
infrastructure. These projects will continue to support GDP growth in
the third quarter and the fourth quarter.

The economist said credit growth momentum is set to last into the end of
the year, although any cut in interest rates are not expected.
