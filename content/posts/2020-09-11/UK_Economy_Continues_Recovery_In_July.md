The UK [economy][1] expanded for the third straight month in July as
lockdown measures continued to ease though it has still only recovered
just over half of the lost output caused by the coronavirus.

Gross domestic product expanded 6.6 percent in July from June, when it
gained 8.7 percent, data published by the Office for National Statistics
showed Friday. GDP was forecast to climb 6.7 percent.

"While it has continued steadily on the path towards recovery, the UK
economy still has to make up nearly half of the GDP lost since the start
of the pandemic," ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan
said.

GDP was 11.7 percent lower than the pre-pandemic levels seen in February
2020.

In three months to July, GDP fell 7.6 percent from the previous three
months.

As most sectors in the economy are open again there is little scope for
further large rises in monthly GDP, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

On top of that, talk of tax rises at the next Budget, a further
deterioration in the Brexit negotiations and a worrying rise in the
number of virus cases and tighter social distancing restrictions will
all conspire to slow the recovery even further, the economist added.

Data showed that the growth in services output eased to 6.1 percent in
July from 7.7 percent in June.

Likewise, industrial output rose 5.2 percent, slower than the 9.3
percent increase seen in the previous month. Manufacturing output
advanced 6.3 percent.

At the same time, construction output advanced 17.6 percent, but slower
than the 23.6 percent increase in June. Farm output grew only 1.1
percent.

Year-on-year, the decline in industrial production slowed to 7.8 percent
in July from 12.5 percent. Manufacturing was down 9.4 percent versus a
14.6 percent drop in June.

Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade deficit
widened in July as exports decreased amid rising imports. The shortfall
increased to GBP 8.63 billion in July from GBP 6.55 billion in June.

Exports fell 0.9 percent on month, while imports grew 5.8 percent in
July.

The surplus on services decreased to GBP 9.7 billion from GBP 10.45
billion in the previous month. Consequently, the total trade surplus
fell to GBP 1.07 billion from GBP 3.9 billion a month ago.
