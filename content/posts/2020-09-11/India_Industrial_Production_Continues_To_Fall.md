India's industrial production continued to decrease sharply in July,
driven by a steep drop in manufacturing, despite businesses re-opening
gradually following a lockdown to battle the [coronavirus][1].  
  
Industrial production dropped 10.4 percent year-on-year in July, data
from the statistics ministry showed Friday, which was smaller than the
11.5 percent decline economists had forecast.  
  
In June, production shrunk a revised 15.8 percent.  
  
Manufacturing output fell 11.1 percent year-on-year in July.  
  
Mining output decreased 13.0 percent and electricity production fell 2.5
percent.

In the April to July period, industrial production slumped 29.2 percent
from a year ago.
