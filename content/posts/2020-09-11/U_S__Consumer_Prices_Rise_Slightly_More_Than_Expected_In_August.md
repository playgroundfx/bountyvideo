A report released by the Labor Department on Friday showed consumer
prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than anticipated in the
month of August.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index climbed by 0.4
percent in August after advancing by 0.6 percent for two straight
months. Economists had expected consumer prices to rise by 0.3 percent.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices still rose by 0.4
percent in August following a 0.6 percent increase in July. Core
consumer prices were expected to edge up by 0.2 percent.
