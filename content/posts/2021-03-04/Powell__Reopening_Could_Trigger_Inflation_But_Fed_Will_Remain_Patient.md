Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged Thursday the
reopening of the U.S. [economy][1] could lead to higher inflation but
reiterated the central bank will remain "patient" with regard to
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

"We expect that as the economy reopens and hopefully picks up, we will
see inflation move up through base effects," Powell said in closely
watched remarks during The Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit. "That could
create some upward pressure on prices."

However, the Fed chief said he expects the increase in inflation to be
"transitory," noting an acceleration in the annual rate of inflation
would largely reflect comparisons to the low prices seen a year ago.

Powell stressed there is "a lot of ground to cover" before price growth
reaches a sustainable level above the Fed's 2 percent target.

The Fed has recently signaled that interest rates will remain at near-
zero levels until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent
for some time.

Investors were closely monitoring Powell's comments following a recent
spike in bond yields, which has raised concerns about inflation and the
outlook for interest rates.

Powell said the recent jump in yields has "caught my attention," and he
would be "concerned by disorderly conditions in [markets][2] or
persistent tightening in financial conditions that threatens the
achievement of our goals."

Nonetheless, the Fed chief did not signal a "twist" in the central
bank's asset purchases as some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had been hoping for, leading to
another surge in yields.

The increase in yields triggered a sell-off by stocks on Wall Street,
with high-flying [technology][3] stocks helping lead the way lower.

The Dow and the S&P 500 have tumbled to their lowest intraday levels in
a month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has plunged to a two-month intraday
low.
