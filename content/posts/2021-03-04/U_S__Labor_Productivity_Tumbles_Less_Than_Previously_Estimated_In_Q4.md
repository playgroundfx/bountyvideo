A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. labor
productivity plunged by less than initially estimated in the fourth
quarter of 2020.

The Labor Department said labor productivity tumbled by 4.2 percent in
the fourth quarter compared to the previously reported 4.8 percent
nosedive. Economists had expected the slump in productivity to be
revised to 4.7 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed the spike in unit labor costs in the fourth
quarter was downwardly revised to 6.0 percent from the previously
reported 6.8 percent. The revised data was expected to show a 6.7
percent surge in labor costs.
