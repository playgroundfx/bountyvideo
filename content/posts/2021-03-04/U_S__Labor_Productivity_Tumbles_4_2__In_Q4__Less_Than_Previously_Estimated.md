A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. labor
productivity plunged by less than initially estimated in the fourth
quarter of 2020.

The Labor Department said labor productivity tumbled by 4.2 percent in
the fourth quarter compared to the previously reported 4.8 percent
nosedive. Economists had expected the slump in productivity to be
revised to 4.7 percent.

The revision to productivity, a measure of output per hour, reflected an
upward revision to output and a downward revision to hours worked.

Output shot up by 5.5 percent compared to the previously reported 5.3
percent jump, while hours worked soared by 10.1 percent compared to the
previously reported 10.7 percent spike.

Despite the revision, the steep drop in productivity in the fourth
quarter still reflected a substantial downturn following a revised 4.2
percent surge in productivity in the third quarter.

"Looking ahead, we expect productivity to strengthen in coming quarters
and remain well supported as the [economy][1] experiences a mini boom in
activity and the labor market lags to overall economic recovery," said
Lydia Boussour, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Stronger productivity gains should buffer companies' bottom
lines against rising input costs and further boost profit growth this
year amid an expected surge in companies' sales."

The report also showed the spike in unit labor costs in the fourth
quarter was downwardly revised to 6.0 percent from the previously
reported 6.8 percent. The revised data was expected to show a 6.7
percent jump in labor costs.

The downward revision to labor costs reflected the revision to
productivity as well as a downward revision to hourly compensation,
which climbed by 1.5 percent compared to the previously reported 1.7
percent increase.

The sharp increase in labor costs in the fourth quarter reflected a
significant rebound from the revised 9.6 percent nosedive in the third
quarter.
