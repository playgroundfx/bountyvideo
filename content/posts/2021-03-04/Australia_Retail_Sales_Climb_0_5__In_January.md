The total value of retail sales in Australia was up a seasonally
adjusted 0.5 percent on month in January, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Thursday - coming in at A$30.512 billion.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 0.6 percent following
the 4.1 percent decline in December.

Individually, sales were higher for food (1.6 percent), household goods
(0.1 percent) and other (1.4 percent). Sales were down for clothing
(-3.6 percent), department stores (-0.4 percent) and restaurants (-0.8
percent).

On a yearly basis, the value of retail sales was up 10.6 percent.
