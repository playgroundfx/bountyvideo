Ahead of Friday's more closely watched monthly employment report, the
Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a modest increase
in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week ended
February 27th.

The report said initial jobless claims inched up to 745,000, an increase
of 9,000 from the previous week's revised level of 736,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 750,000 from the
730,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average fell to 790,750, a decrease of 16,750 from the previous week's
revised average of 807,500.
