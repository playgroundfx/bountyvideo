Malaysia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged again as
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed that the economic growth is set to improve in the
quarters ahead due to revival in external demand and consumer spending.  
  
The Monetary Policy Committee decided to maintain the Overnight Policy
Rate at 1.75 percent, Bank Negara Malaysia said in a statement Thursday.
That was in line with economists' expectations.  
  
The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in July
last year.  
  
"The MPC considers the stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to be appropriate and
accommodative," the central bank said.

Policymakers expect growth to improve from the second quarter onwards,
driven by the recovery in global demand, increased public and private
sector expenditure amid continued support from [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures and more
targeted containment measures.

The roll-out of the domestic COVID-19 vaccine programme is also expected
to lift sentiments and economic activity.  
  
"The growth outlook, however, remains subject to downside risks,
stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties in developments related to
the pandemic, and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of
vaccines both globally and domestically," the bank said.  
  
Higher global oil prices are expected to boost inflation. Continued
spare capacity in the [economy][1] is set to keep core inflation
subdued.

The bank's latest actions suggest that it is not eager to loosen [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
and rates are likely to remain to remain on hold for the foreseeable
future, Capital Economics economist Alex Holmes said.
