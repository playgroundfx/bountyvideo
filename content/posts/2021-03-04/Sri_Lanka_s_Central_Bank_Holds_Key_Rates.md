Sri Lanka's central bank retained its key interest rates as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers
assessed that the current accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance was
appropriate.

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, on Thursday,
decided to hold the Standing Deposit Facility Rate at 4.50 percent and
the Standing Lending Facility Rate at 5.50 percent.

The bank had last reduced its key rates by 100 basis points in July.

Both headline and core inflation based on consumer price indices
remained low. Inflation was projected to remain subdued during the
remainder of the year.

The bank expects domestic [economy][1] to make a notable recovery in
2021, supported by [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus and improving [business][2]
sentiments.

The central bank urged banks to scale up lending to productive sectors
of the economy and support domestic production in line with the national
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) direction.

The bank said it will take further proactive measures to help the
economy to reach a sustainable high growth trajectory, while maintaining
inflation in the targeted 4-6 percent range under the flexible inflation
targeting framework.

Given the poor outlook for the economy, the CBSL will want to resume its
easing cycle soon, but that will only happen if pressure on the rupee
subsides, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
