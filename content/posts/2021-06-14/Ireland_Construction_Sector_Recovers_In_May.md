Ireland's construction sector expanded in May for the first time since
the imposition of the lockdown at the start of the year, survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank Construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 66.4 in
May from 49.3 in April. A score above 50 indicates expansion in the
sector.

All three broad categories of construction, namely housing activity,
commercial activity and civil engineering activity expanded in May.

New orders accelerated in May with the rate of expansion fastest in the
twenty-one year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Staffing levels rose for the second straight month in May and at the
fastest since April 2019. Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in May.

On the price front, the rate of cost inflation increased to a record
level in May.

The further reopening of the [economy][1] and continued release of pent-
up demand supported ongoing confidence among construction firms that
activity will increase over the coming year.
