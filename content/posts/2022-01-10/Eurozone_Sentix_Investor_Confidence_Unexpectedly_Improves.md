Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence unexpectedly improved in January, after
easing sharply in the previous month, survey results from the behavioral
research firm Sentix showed Monday.  
  
The headline index climbed to 14.9 from 13.5 in December. Economists had
forecast a weaker score of 12.0.

"Investors do not expect economic momentum to stall in the new year
either - despite new virus variants and rising infection figures,"
Sentix said.

The current situation index of the survey rose to 16.3 from 13.3,
improving for the first time in four months.  
  
Meanwhile, the expectations measure fell to 13.5 from 13.8 in the
previous month. That was the first decline in three months.

The latest poll was conducted from January 6 to 8 among 1,163 [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
of whom 254 were institutions.

The German [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index improved in January, rising to 17.0
from 14.4 in the previous month. That was the first increase in five
months. The current situation index also rose for the first time in five
months, climbing to 19.0 from 13.8. The expectations measure was stable
at 15.0.  
  
The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index for the US dropped in January to 23.3 from
24.2. The current assessment measure eased for a sixth month in a row to
34, it lowest level since April last year. The expectations measure rose
to 13.0 from 14.5.

For Asia ex Japan, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index rose to 21.7, the
highest level since August last year. The current situation index
climbed to 20.0 and the expectations measure rose for a third straight
month to 23.5, its highest level since July 2021.  
  
"The figures for the Asia ex Japan region are particularly
encouraging...This gives more contour to our basic scenario that the
global [economy][1] will recover and emerge from the mid-cycle
slowdown," Sentix said.
