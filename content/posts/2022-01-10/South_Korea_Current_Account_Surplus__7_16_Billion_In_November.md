South Korea had a current account surplus of $7.16 billion in November,
the Bank of Korea said on Tuesday - up from $6.95 billion in October.

The goods account surplus decreased to $5.95 billion, compared to the
$9.95 billion figure in November 2020.

The services account deficit fell to $0.14 billion, from $0.98 billion
in November last year, owing to an improvement in the transport account.

The primary income account surplus increased from $0.48 billion the year
previously to $1.49 billion in November 2021.
