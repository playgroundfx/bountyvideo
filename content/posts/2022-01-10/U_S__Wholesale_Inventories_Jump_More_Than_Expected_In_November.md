Wholesale inventories in the U.S. jumped by more than expected in the
month of November, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Monday.

The report said wholesale inventories surged up by 1.4 percent in
November after spiking by 2.5 percent in October. Economists had
expected inventories to increase by 1.2 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in wholesale inventories came as
inventories of durable goods shot up by 2.1 percent, while inventories
of non-durable goods rose by 0.3 percent.

The Commerce Department said wholesale sales also jumped by 1.3 percent
in November after soaring by 2.5 percent in the previous month.

With inventories and sales both showing significant increases, the
inventories/sales ratio for merchant wholesalers was unchanged at 1.22.
