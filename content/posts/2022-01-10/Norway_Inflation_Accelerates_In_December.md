Norway's consumer price inflation accelerated further in December on
higher energy prices, data from Statistics Norway showed on Monday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 5.3 percent in December from 5.1
percent in November.

The annual inflation was driven by the 15.9 percent increase in housing,
water, electricity, gas and other fuel prices. Transport prices were up
5.2 percent, while food and non-alcoholic beverages prices dropped 1.9
percent and clothing and footwear prices dropped 1.2 percent.

Core inflation advanced to 1.8 percent from 1.3 percent in the previous
month. The rate was forecast to rise marginally to 1.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices gained 0.7 percent and core
prices grew 0.4 percent in December.

At the same time, EU harmonized inflation advanced to 6.1 percent
annually from 5.8 percent in November.

Another report from the statistical office showed that producer price
inflation surged to 68.7 percent in December from 58.6 percent in the
previous month.  
Month-on-month, producer prices moved up 8.1 percent after climbing 3
percent in November.

While Norwegian [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers do not have as laser-like a focus on
consumer price inflation as most, the increase in the core rate in
Norway in December only lends support to the hawkish view that the
Norges Bank will raise interest rates more aggressively than [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
expect this year, David Oxley, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
