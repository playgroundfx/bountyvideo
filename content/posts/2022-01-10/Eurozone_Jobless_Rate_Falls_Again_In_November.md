The euro area unemployment rate dropped again in November despite rising
[coronavirus][1] cases, preliminary figures from the statistical office
Eurostat revealed on Monday.

The jobless rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 7.2 percent, in line with
expectations, from 7.3 percent in October.

Similarly, the unemployment rate in the EU27 eased to 6.5 percent from
6.7 percent a month ago.

The number of unemployed in the EU totaled 13.984 million persons in
November, of whom 11.829 persons were in Eurozone, data showed.

Compared to the previous month, the jobless figure fell by 247,000
persons in the EU and by 222,000 in the euro area.

On a year-on-year basis, the unemployment total decreased by 1.659
million persons in the EU and by 1.411 million in the euro area.

The youth jobless rate, which applies to those under 25 years of age,
fell to 15.5 percent in the euro area from 15.8 percent in the previous
month. The corresponding rate for the EU eased to 15.4 percent from 15.6
percent.

Since November, Covid cases have shot up in Europe but the latest
surveys (for December) point to employment continuing to rise, Jack
Allen-Reynolds, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Continued gains in employment might not put as much upward pressure on
wages in the euro-zone as in the US, because in Europe there has not
been a big decline in the workforce, the economist added.

Nevertheless, the economist said with the implied level of employment
also above its pre-pandemic peak, firms are reporting that labor
shortages are a constraint on production.

Data released by Italy's statistical office on Monday showed that the
jobless rate fell to 9.2 percent in November from 9.4 percent in
October.
