After reporting a slowdown in the pace of job growth over the two
previous months, the Labor Department released a report on Friday
showing U.S. employment increased by more than expected in the month of
October.

The report said non-farm payroll employment surged up by 531,000 jobs in
October after climbing by an upwardly revised 312,000 jobs in September.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 425,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 194,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

"The October jobs report pointed to a reacceleration in job creation
supported by improving [health][1] conditions and gradually rebounding
labor supply," said Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector helped lead the
stronger than expected job growth, increasing by 164,000 jobs.

The Labor Department also cited notable job gains in professional and
[business][2] services, manufacturing, and transportation and
warehousing, which helped more than offset a drop in employment in
public education.

With employment increasing by more than expected, the unemployment rate
fell to 4.6 percent in October from 4.8 percent in September, hitting
its lowest level since March of 2020. The unemployment rate was expected
to edge down to 4.7 percent.

The drop in the unemployment rate came as household employment increased
by 359,000 persons, while the labor force rose by just 104,000 persons.

The report also showed average hourly earnings climbed by $0.11 or 0.7
percent to $30.96 in October, with annual wage growth accelerating to
4.9 percent from 4.6 percent.

"The stronger 531,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in October as the
[economy][3] rebounded from the Delta hit is an encouraging sign that
demand remains strong," Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital
Economics.

He added, "But with growth of the labor force still muted, that is
feeding through to a continued decline in unemployment and an even
stronger pick-up in wage growth."
