Germany industrial production declined unexpectedly in September on
supply bottlenecks, figures from Destatis revealed on Friday.

Industrial production dropped 1.1 percent on a monthly basis, but slower
than the revised 3.5 percent decline seen in August. Economists had
forecast a monthly growth of 1 percent.

On a yearly basis, retail sales fell 1 percent, in contrast to the 2.2
percent increase in August.

The [economy][1] ministry said the supply bottlenecks for raw materials
and intermediate products have persisted for a long time and that is
reflected on a broader front.

Business surveys suggest that shortages of components, particularly in
the auto sector, will keep manufacturing very weak during the fourth
quarter, and the outlook for early 2022 is not looking much better,
Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Although there have recently been some rays of hope, a sweeping
turnaround is not to be expected for the time being, with the result
that manufacturing will once again make little contribution to economic
growth in the fourth quarter, Ralph Solveen, a senior economist at
Commerzbank, said.

Excluding energy and construction, industrial production dropped 1.5
percent in September, data showed.

Within industry, capital goods output showed a decrease of 2.8 percent
and the production of intermediate goods was down 1.1 percent.

There was an increase of 2.1 percent in the manufacture of motor
vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers. At the same time, consumer goods
output gained 0.2 percent in September.

Energy production was up 1.0 percent and the production in construction
moved up 1.1 percent.

Underpinned by foreign demand, new orders grew 1.3 percent month-on-
month in September, reversing an 8.8 percent decrease in August,
official data showed on Thursday.
