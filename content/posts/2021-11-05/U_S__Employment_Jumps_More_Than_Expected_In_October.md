After reporting a slowdown in the pace of job growth over the two
previous months, the Labor Department released a report on Friday
showing U.S. employment increased by more than expected in the month of
October.

The report said non-farm payroll employment surged up by 531,000 jobs in
October after climbing by an upwardly revised 312,000 jobs in September.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 425,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 194,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

With employment increasing by more than expected, the unemployment rate
fell to 4.6 percent in October from 4.8 percent in September, hitting
its lowest level since March of 2020. The unemployment rate was expected
to edge down to 4.7 percent.
