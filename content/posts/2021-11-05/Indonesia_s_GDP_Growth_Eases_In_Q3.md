Indonesia's [economy][1] expanded at a slower pace in the third quarter,
Statistics Indonesia reported Friday.

Gross domestic product expanded 3.51 percent on a yearly basis, after
rising 7.07 percent in the second quarter. This was weaker than the
expected growth of 3.76 percent. Nonetheless, the economy expanded for
the second consecutive quarter.

On a quarterly basis, the economy grew 1.55 percent, slower than the
economists' forecast of 1.8 percent.

With restrictions being relaxed and virus cases now very low, the
economy is expected to bounce back strongly in the final quarter, Gareth
Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said. That said, any
tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is still a long way off.
