Spain's industrial production growth eased for a fifth straight month
and at a faster than expected pace in September, preliminary data from
the statistical office INE showed Friday.

The industrial production index rose a seasonally adjusted 1.2 percent
year-on-year following a 1.8 percent increase in August. Economists had
forecast 1.5 percent growth.

Production growth has slowed every month since hitting a peak of 50.3
percent in April.

Production of non-durable consumer goods rose 5.7 percent and that of
intermediate goods increased 3.9 percent.

Capital goods production shrunk 5.8 percent, energy output fell 1.8
percent and durable consumer goods manufacturing decreased 0.1 percent
from a year ago.

The non-adjusted industrial production growth slowed to 1.9 percent from
3.6 percent.

Compared to the previous month, industrial production grew for the first
time in four months. Output rose 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent fall in
August.

Non-durable consumer goods production rose 1.9 percent and energy output
increased 1.3 percent.
