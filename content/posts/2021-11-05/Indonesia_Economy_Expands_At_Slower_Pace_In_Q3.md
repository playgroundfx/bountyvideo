Indonesia's economic growth eased in the third quarter as strict
restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 dampened household
consumption, Statistics Indonesia reported Friday.

Gross domestic product expanded 3.51 percent on a yearly basis, after
rising 7.07 percent in the second quarter. This was also weaker than the
expected growth of 3.76 percent.

Nonetheless, the [economy][1] expanded for the second consecutive
quarter.

On a sequential basis, the economy grew 1.55 percent, which was also
slower than the economists' forecast of 1.8 percent.

On the expenditure-side, exports logged the biggest annual growth of
29.16 percent. At the same time, imports were up 30.11 percent.

Household consumption rose only 1.03 percent and government consumption
by 0.66 percent. Investment rose 3.74 percent.

With restrictions being relaxed and virus cases now very low, the
economy is expected to bounce back strongly in the final quarter, Gareth
Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said. That said, any
tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is still a long way off.

The economist forecast strong GDP growth of around 4 percent
sequentially in the fourth quarter.

At the October [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, Bank Indonesia had retained its key
interest rate at 3.50 percent.

The central bank forecast the economic growth to continue to improve
until the fourth quarter so that the whole of 2021 will remain within
the range of Bank Indonesia's projection at 3.5 percent-4.3 percent.
