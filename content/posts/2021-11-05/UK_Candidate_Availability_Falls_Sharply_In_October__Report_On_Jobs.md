UK candidate availability declined sharply in October, leading to softer
rising in hiring activity and a notable increase in pay growth, the
latest KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs survey showed on Friday.

Permanent placements and temporary billings rose steeply in October but
the rates of expansion were the softest seen for six months.

Availability of staff declined at the fifth sharpest pace since the
survey began in 1997. Reduced candidate availability was often linked to
a combination of high demand for staff, general labor shortages, fewer
foreign workers and hesitancy among employees to switch or seek out new
roles.

Growth of demand for staff slipped to a five-month low in October, but
it remained substantial overall and much quicker than the series
average.

A combination of candidate scarcity and robust demand for staff added
further upward pressure starting pay growth. Starting salaries as well
as temp wages increased at the quickest rates seen in over 24 years of
data collection.

"We are starting to see signs that we are moving into a new phase of the
recovery, as the initial bounceback in demand starts to ease," Kate
Shoesmith, deputy CEO of the REC, said.
