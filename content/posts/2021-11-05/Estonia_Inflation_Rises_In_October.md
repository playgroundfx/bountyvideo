Estonia's consumer prices rose in October, data from Statistics Estonia
showed on Friday.

The consumer price index rose 7.0 percent year-on-year in October,
following a 6.6 percent growth in September.

"Compared to October 2020, the consumer price index was affected the
most by transport-related price changes, which contributed slightly over
a third of the total rise in the index," Viktoria Trasanov, leading
analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.

Prices for petrol increased 25.5 percent and diesel prices rose 40.4
percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices declined 0.2 percent in October,
after a 1.2 percent rise in the previous month.
