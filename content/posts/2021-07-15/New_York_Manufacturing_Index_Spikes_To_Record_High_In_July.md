The Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a report on Thursday
showing a substantial acceleration in the pace of growth in New York
manufacturing activity in the month of July.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index soared
to 43.0 in July from 17.4 in June, with a positive reading indicating
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to inch up to 18.0.

With the much bigger than expected increase, the New York Fed's general
business conditions index reached a new record high.

The spike by the headline index came as the new orders index jumped to
33.2 in July from 16.3 in June, while the shipments index shot up to
43.8 from 14.2.

The employment index also advanced to 20.6 in July from 12.3 in June,
indicating strong job growth during the month.

While the report showed the prices received index also climbed to 39.4
in July from 33.3 in June, the prices paid index fell to 76.8 from 79.8.
Both price indexes were still at or near record highs

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months, although the index
for future business conditions slid to 39.5 in July from 47.7 in June.

A separate report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
on Thursday showed a slowdown in the pace of growth in Philadelphia-area
manufacturing activity in the month of July.
