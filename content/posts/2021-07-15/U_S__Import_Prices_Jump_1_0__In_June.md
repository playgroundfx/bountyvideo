A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. import
prices increased in line with economist estimates in the month of June.

The Labor Department said import prices advanced by 1.0 percent in June
after surging by an upwardly revised 1.4 percent in May.

Economists had expected import prices to increase by 1.0 percent
compared to the 1.1 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

Meanwhile, the report said export prices shot up by 1.2 percent in June
after spiking by 2.2 percent in May. Export prices were expected to
surge up by 1.3 percent.
