A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. import
prices increased in line with economist estimates in the month of June.

The Labor Department said import prices advanced by 1.0 percent in June
after surging by an upwardly revised 1.4 percent in May.

Economists had expected import prices to climb by 1.0 percent compared
to the 1.1 percent jump originally reported for the previous month.

The increase in imports prices was partly due to a continued surge in
prices for fuel imports, which spiked by 4.7 percent in June after
soaring by 5.5 percent in May.

Prices for non-fuel imports rose by 0.7 percent in June following a 0.9
percent advance in May, reflecting higher prices for non-fuel industrial
supplies and materials; foods, feeds, and beverages; consumer goods; and
capital goods.

The annual rate of growth in import prices slowed modestly to 11.2
percent in June from 11.6 percent in May, which reflected the largest
year-over-year increase since September of 2011.

"Looking ahead, we expect import prices to cool as supply-demand
imbalances gradually take the pressure off rising costs," said Mahir
Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "However, we expect warmer inflation will persist through
2022, while greater U.S. demand relative to its trading partners will
keep import growth firmly ahead of exports."

Meanwhile, the report said export prices shot up by 1.2 percent in June
after spiking by 2.2 percent in May. Export prices were expected to
surge by 1.3 percent.

Prices for agricultural exports jumped by 1.5 percent in June after
soaring by 6.1 percent in May, while prices for non-agricultural exports
increased by 1.1 percent following a 1.8 percent advance in the previous
month.

Compared to the same month a year ago, export prices in June were up by
16.8 percent, reflecting a slowdown from the 17.5 percent spike in May.
