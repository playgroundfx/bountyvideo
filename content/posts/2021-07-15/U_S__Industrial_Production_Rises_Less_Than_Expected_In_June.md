Partly reflecting a modest decrease in manufacturing output, the Federal
Reserve released a report on Thursday showing U.S. industrial production
increased by less than expected in the month of June.

The Fed said industrial production rose by 0.4 percent in June after
climbing by a downwardly revised 0.7 percent in May.

Economists had expected industrial production to increase by 0.7 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent advance originally reported for the previous
month.

The uptick in industrial production was largely due to a 2.7 percent
spike in utilities output, which reflected heightened demand for air
conditioning, as much of the country experienced a heat wave in June.

Mining output also jumped by 1.4 percent during the month, while
manufacturing output edged down by 0.1 percent.

The dip in manufacturing output came as an ongoing shortage of
semiconductors contributed to a 6.6 percent nosedive in the production
of motor vehicles and parts.

"Manufacturing output ex-autos rose by 0.4%, though that only brings it
into line with pre-pandemic levels, which is a major disappointment
given the strong rebound in goods demand," said Michael Pearce, Senior
U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "That highlights the role broader shortages - primarily of
skilled workers - that are still holding the sector back."

Meanwhile, the Fed said capacity utilization for the industrial sector
rose to 75.4 percent in June from 75.1 percent in May. Economists had
expected capacity utilization to climb to 75.6 percent.

Capacity utilization in the utilities and mining sectors increased to
74.5 percent and 76.7 percent, respectively, while capacity utilization
in the manufacturing sector edged down to 75.3 percent.
