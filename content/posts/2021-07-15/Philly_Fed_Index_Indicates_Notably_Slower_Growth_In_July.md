A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed a slowdown in the pace of growth in Philadelphia-area
manufacturing activity in the month of July.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current general activity
fell to 21.9 in July from 30.7 in June, although a positive reading
still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists
had expected the index to slip to 28.0.

The much bigger than expected decrease by the headline index came as the
new orders index slid to 17.0 in July from 22.2 in June, while the
shipments index fell to 24.6 from 27.2.

The number of employees index also edged down to 29.2 in July from 30.7
in June, indicating a slight slowdown in the pace of price growth.

The report also showed the prices paid index tumbled to 69.7 in July
from 80.7 in June, while the prices received index slipped to 46.8 from
49.7.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said the diffusion index for future
general activity tumbled to 48.6 in July from a nearly 30-year high of
69.2 in June.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a separate report on
Thursday showing a substantial acceleration in the pace of growth in New
York manufacturing activity in the month of July.
