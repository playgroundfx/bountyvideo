The manufacturing sector in New Zealand continued to expand in June, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Friday
with a manufacturing PMI score of 60.7.

That's up from 58.6 in May and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, all of the major components were firmly in expansion
territory, including production (64.5), employment (56.5), new orders
(63.6), finished stocks (57.3) and deliveries (55.0).

"The overt strength in the PMI comes amid ongoing supply side challenges
that the sector faces and clear weakness in the Central region during
the month," said BNZ Senior Economist, Doug Steel.
