Consumer prices in New Zealand were up 3.3 percent on year in the second
quarter of 2021, Statistics New Zealand said on Friday - exceeding
expectations for 2.8 percent and up sharply from 1.5 percent in the
three months prior.

Individually, transport prices increased 9.4 percent, with private
transport supplies and services up 11 percent. Housing and household
utilities increased 3.9 percent, with home ownership up 7.4 percent.

Food prices increased 1.6 percent, with restaurant meals and ready-to-
eat food up 4.3 percent. Recreation and culture prices increased 2.6
percent, with accommodation services up 11 percent.

On a quarterly basis, inflation climbed a seasonally adjusted 1.3
percent - again beating forecasts for 0.8 percent, which would have been
unchanged from the first quarter.
