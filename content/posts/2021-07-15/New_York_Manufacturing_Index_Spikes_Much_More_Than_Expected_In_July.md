The Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a report on Thursday
showing a substantial acceleration in the pace of growth in New York
manufacturing activity in the month of July.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index soared
to 43.0 in July from 17.4 in June, with a positive reading indicating
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to inch up to 18.0.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months, although the index
for future business conditions slid to 39.5 in July from 47.7 in June.
