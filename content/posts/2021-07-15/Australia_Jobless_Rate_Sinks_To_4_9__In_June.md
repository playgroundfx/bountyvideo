The unemployment rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 4.9
percent in June, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

That was beneath expectations for 5.0 percent and down from 5.1 percent
in May.

The Australian [economy][1] added 29.100 jobs last month - shy of
forecasts for the addition of 30,000 jobs following the increase of
115,200 jobs in the previous month.

The participation rate was 66.2 percent - missing forecasts for 66.3
percent but unchanged from the May reading.
