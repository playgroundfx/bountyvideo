(originally -0.7 percent).

On a monthly basis, producer prices jumped 0.8 percent - again exceeding
expectations for 0.4 percent and up from 0.6 percent in the previous
month.

Export prices were up 2.8 percent on month and 5.5 percent on year, the
bank said, while import prices advanced 3.8 percent on month and 5.6
