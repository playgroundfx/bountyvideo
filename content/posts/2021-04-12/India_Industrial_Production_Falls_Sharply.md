India's industrial production declined sharply and at a faster than
expected pace in February, preliminary figures from the statistical
office showed Monday.  
  
The industrial production index dropped 3.6 percent year-on-year
following a 0.9 percent decrease in January. Economists had expected a
3.0 percent fall.  
  
In the same month last year, production grew 5.2 percent.  
  
Manufacturing output fell 3.7 percent from a year ago and mining
production dropped 5.5 percent. Electricity output edged up 0.1 percent.  
  
During the April to February year-to-date period, industrial production
decreased 11.3 percent and manufacturing output shrank 12.6 percent.
