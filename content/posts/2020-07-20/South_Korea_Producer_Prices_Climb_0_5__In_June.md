Producer prices in South Korea advanced 0.5 percent on month in June,
the Bank of Korea said on Tuesday.

That beat forecasts for a gain of 0.3 percent following the flat reading
in May.

Individually, prices for agricultural, forestry and marine products
dropped 1.6 percent on month, while manufacturing products rose 1.0
percent, electric power, gas, water and waste eased 0.1 percent and
services rose 0.3 percent.

On a yearly basis, producer prices sank 0.9 percent - again exceeding
forecasts for a fall of 1.4 percent following the 1.8 percent drop in
the previous month.
