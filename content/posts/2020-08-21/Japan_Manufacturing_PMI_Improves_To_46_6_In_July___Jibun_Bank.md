The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in July, albeit
at a weaker pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank showed on Friday
with a manufacturing PMI score of 46.6.

That's up from 45.2 in June, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The survey also showed that the services PMI fell to 45.0 from 45.4 in
June, while the composite PMI was unchanged at 44.9.

Individually, output, new orders, new export orders, employment,
backlogs of work, output prices, input prices and future output all
remained in contraction territory.
