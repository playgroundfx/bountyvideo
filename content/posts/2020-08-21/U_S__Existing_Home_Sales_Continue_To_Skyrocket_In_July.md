Existing home sales in the U.S. continued to soar in the month of July,
the National Association of Realtors revealed in a report released on
Friday.

NAR said existing home sales skyrocketed by a record 24.7 percent to an
annual rate of 5.86 million in July after spiking by 20.2 percent to a
revised rate of 4.70 million in June.

Economists had expected existing home sales to jump by 14.0 percent to
an annual rate of 5.38 million from the 4.72 million originally reported
for the previous month.

With the continued surge, existing home sales in July were up by 8.7
percent compared to the same month a year ago.

"The housing market is well past the recovery phase and is now booming
with higher home sales compared to the pre-pandemic days," said Lawrence
Yun, NAR's chief economist.

He added, "With the sizable shift in remote work, current homeowners are
looking for larger homes and this will lead to a secondary level of
demand even into 2021."

The report said the median existing home price was $304,100 in July, up
3.3 percent from $294,500 in June and up 8.5 percent from $280,400 a
year ago. NAR noted this is the first time the national median home
price breached the $300,000 level.

NAR also said total housing inventory fell by 2.6 percent to 1.50
million units at the end of July from 1.54 million units at the end of
June and is down 21.1 percent year-over-year.

The unsold inventory represents 3.1 months of supply at the current
sales rate, down from 3.9 months in June and 4.2 months in July of 2019.

"The number of new listings is increasing, but they are quickly taken
out of the market from heavy buyer competition," Yun said. "More homes
need to be built."

The report also said single-family homes sales spiked by 23.9 percent to
an annual rate of 5.28 million in July, while existing condominium and
co-op sales soared by 31.8 percent to a rate of 580,000.

Next Tuesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report
on new home sales in the month of July.
