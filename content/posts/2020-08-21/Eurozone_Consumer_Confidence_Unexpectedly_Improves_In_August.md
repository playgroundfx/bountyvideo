Euro area consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in August, amid fears of
a second wave of [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, infections in some
countries in the bloc, preliminary figures from the European Commission
showed on Friday.

The consumer confidence index rose to -14.7 from -15 in July. Economists
had expected the index to remain unchanged.

In June, the reading was at -14.7.

The consumer confidence index for EU edged up to -15.5 from -15.6 in
July.

Both indicators remain well below their long-term averages of -11.1 and
-10.5, respectively.

The final readings for August are scheduled to be released along with
the monthly economic sentiment survey data on August 28.
