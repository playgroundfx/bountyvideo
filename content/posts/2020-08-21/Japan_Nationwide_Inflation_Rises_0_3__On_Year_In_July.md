Nationwide consumer prices in Japan were up 0.3 percent on year in July,
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on Friday - in
line with expectations and up from 0.1 percent in June.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food costs, came in flat on year - shy
of expectations for an increase of 0.1 percent but unchanged from the
previous month.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall consumer prices were up
0.2 percent and core consumer prices gained 0.1 percent.
