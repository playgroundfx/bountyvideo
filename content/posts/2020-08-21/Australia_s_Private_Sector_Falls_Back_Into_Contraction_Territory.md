Australia's private sector contracted in August due to the re-imposition
of [coronavirus][1] disease containment measures in parts of the
country, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed Friday.

The Commonwealth composite output index fell to 48.8 in August from 57.8
in July. A score below 50 indicates contraction.  
  
New order inflows dropped after two months of growth while employment
contracted at a steeper rate. Inflationary pressures intensified in
August.  
  
Business confidence weakened slightly, but remained positive overall as
firms continued to expect further recovery from the Covid-19 downturn
over the coming twelve months.

The overall reduction in operations contrasted with two months of solid
growth. The survey showed that trends diverged between services and
manufacturing sectors.

The downturn in overall activity was primarily driven by the service
sector, as manufacturing output continued to rise. The services
Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 48.1 from 58.2 in July.

At the same time, the manufacturing PMI fell marginally to 53.9 in
August from 54.0 a month ago.
