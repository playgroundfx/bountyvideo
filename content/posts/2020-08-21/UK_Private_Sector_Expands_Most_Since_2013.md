The UK private sector grew at the fastest pace since late 2013 as both
manufacturing and service sectors recovered in August following the
reopening of the [economy][1] after the lockdown, flash data from IHS
Markit showed Friday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply flash
composite output index climbed to 60.3 in August from 57.0 in July. A
score above 50 indicates expansion.

The index signaled the fastest growth since October 2013 and the reading
was also above economists' forecast of 57.1.

The manufacturing sector grew at a slightly faster pace than service
sector activity in August. The flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers'
Index hit a 30-month high of 55.3 versus July's 53.3.

At 60.1, the flash services PMI came in at 72-month high in August and
up from 56.5 in July.

Total volumes of new work expanded for the second month running in
August, with the latest increase the fastest since mid-2014. However,
concerns about the speed and duration of the recovery resulted in
sustained job cuts across the private sector.

Despite a slowdown in inflation, average cost burdens increased strongly
in August. Survey respondents noted that higher fuel bills and rising
costs for imported items had pushed up operating expenses, which was
only partially offset by higher average prices charged.

Further, [business][2] optimism eased slightly since July as some
manufacturers cited worries about the sustainability of the recovery
over the longer term.

The survey provided further evidence that the recovery continued at a
strong pace in the third quarter, Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. Even so, rising unemployment is likely to put a brake
on the recovery later this year.
