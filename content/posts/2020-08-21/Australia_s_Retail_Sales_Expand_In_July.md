Australia's retail sales expanded in July as all states except Victoria
reported monthly growth in turnover, preliminary data from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Friday.

Retail turnover increased 3.3 percent month-on-month in July. On a
yearly basis, retail sales grew 12.2 percent.

Due to a spike in [coronavirus][1] cases in Victoria, retail sales fell
2 percent on month in July. Victorian turnover fell across Clothing,
footwear and personal accessory retailing, Cafes, restaurants and
takeaway food services, and Department stores.

At the national level, household goods retailing led the monthly rises
across the industries in July. Turnover in household goods was 30
percent above the levels of July 2019, with sales of furniture, white
goods and electrical items remaining high.

Food retailing registered a rise of 1.2 percent, with supermarket and
grocery store turnover elevated in Victoria especially, with spikes in
sales of non-perishable items evident in July, the statistical office
said.
