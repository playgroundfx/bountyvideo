Hungary's central bank left its key rate unchanged after cutting it for
two straight months.

The Monetary Council of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank on Tuesday decided to
hold the base rate at 0.60 percent, as widely expected.

The bank had lowered the rate by 15 basis points each at the previous
two rate-setting sessions.

The overnight central bank deposit rate was retained at -0.05 percent
and the one-week collateralized loan rate was maintained at 1.85
percent.

Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics, said further interest
rate cuts are now off the table. The rise in inflation and the central
bank's concerns about the forint mean that the risks are becoming skewed
towards tightening.
