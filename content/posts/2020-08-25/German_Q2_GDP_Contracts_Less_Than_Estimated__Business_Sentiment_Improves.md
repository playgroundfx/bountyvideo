Germany's [economy][1] shrank less than initially estimated in the
second quarter but the pace of contraction was the sharpest on record as
the coronavirus pandemic shattered spending, investment and trade,
revised data from Destatis revealed Tuesday.

Elsewhere, survey results from the ifo Institute showed that German
[business][2] confidence improved for the fourth straight month in
August.

Gross domestic product fell 9.7 percent sequentially after shrinking 2
percent in the first quarter. The rate was revised down from -10.1
percent estimated on July 30.

Nonetheless, the quarterly decline was much larger than during the
financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009 and the sharpest since
quarterly GDP calculations started in 1970.

The statistical office confirmed that the largest euro area economy has
entered a recession in the second quarter.

On a yearly basis, GDP declined by a [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)-adjusted 11.3 percent in
the second quarter versus the 2.2 percent fall posted in the first
quarter and the initial estimate of -11.7 percent.

Price-adjusted GDP also declined 11.3 percent in the second quarter,
which was revised from -11.7 percent.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household spending slid 10.9
percent on quarter due to the ongoing corona pandemic and the
restrictions related with it, Destatis said. Preventing a larger GDP
decline, government spending grew 1.5 percent.

Gross fixed capital formation decreased 7.9 percent as investment in
machinery and equipment plunged 19.6 percent and that in construction
fell 4.2 percent.

Exports and imports logged double-digit decreases of 20.3 percent and 16
percent, respectively. This suggests that the decreases were even
markedly larger than during the financial and economic crisis in the
first quarter of 2009.

A big rebound in the third quarter is already baked in the cake, but
survey evidence, including from the Ifo business climate suggests that
the recovery is slowing, Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

According to ifo, the business confidence index rose to a six-month high
of 92.6 in August from 90.4 in July. This was above economists' forecast
of 92.2.

The German economy is on the road to recovery, ifo Institute President
Clemens Fuest said.

Companies assessed their current business situation markedly more
positively than last month. Their expectations were also slightly more
optimistic.

The current conditions indicator advanced to 87.9 from 84.5 a month ago.
The expected level was 87.0.

Likewise, the expectations indicator came in at 97.5 versus 96.7 in the
previous month. The reading was forecast to rise to 98.0.

Business sentiment strengthened in manufacturing, services and
construction in August, while the upward trend flattened in trade.

Today's Ifo index keeps the hopes for a V-shaped rebound alive, Carsten
Brzeski, an ING economist, said. However, the fact that a rebound is not
necessarily the same as a recovery will be the main theme of the coming
months.
