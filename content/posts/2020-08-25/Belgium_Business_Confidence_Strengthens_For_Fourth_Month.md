Belgium's [business][1] confidence strengthened for a fourth straight
month in August as morale improved in manufacturing and business
services sectors, survey data from the National Bank of Belgium showed
on Tuesday.

The business confidence index rose to -12 from -13.9 in July. Economists
had forecast a score of -11.5.

The business climate improved in the manufacturing industry and in
business-related services, while morale weakened in the building
industry and trade.

Manufacturers assessed their current situation as brighter and expects
the employment to increase in coming months. Services firms were
optimistic about business activity and market demand.

Constructors also expect demand to increase modestly in the coming three
months.

Meanwhile, all components of the trade indicator got worse, notably the
unemployment outlook and forecasts for orders placed with suppliers, the
survey found.
