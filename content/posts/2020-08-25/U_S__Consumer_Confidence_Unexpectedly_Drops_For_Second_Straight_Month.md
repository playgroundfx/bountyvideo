Reflecting a significant deterioration in consumers' assessment of
current conditions, the Conference Board released a report on Tuesday
showing U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly declined for the second
straight month in August.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slumped to 84.8
in August after tumbling to a downwardly revised 91.7 in July.

The continued decrease came as a surprise to economists, who had
expected the index to inch up to 93.0 from the 92.6 originally reported
for the previous month.

The unexpected decrease by the headline index came as the present
situation index plunged to 84.2 in August from 95.9 in July.

The percentage of consumers claiming current [business][1] conditions
are "good" dipped to 16.4 percent from 17.5 percent, while those
claiming conditions are "bad" jumped to 43.6 percent from 38.9 percent.

Consumers' appraisal of the job market was also less favorable, with
consumers saying jobs are "plentiful" edging down to 21.5 percent from
22.3 percent and those claiming jobs are "hard to get" rising to 25.2
percent from 20.1 percent.

The Conference Board said its expectations index also fell to 85.2 in
August from 88.9 in July, as consumers were more pessimistic about the
short-term outlook.

Consumers expecting business conditions will improve over the next six
months slipped to 29.9 percent from 31.6 percent, while those expecting
business conditions will worsen inched up to 20.5 percent from 20.2
percent.

The outlook for the labor market was also less positive, as consumers
expecting more jobs in the months ahead edged down to 29.1 percent from
29.6 percent and those anticipating fewer jobs ticked up to 21.9 percent
from 21.3 percent.

The report also said the percentage of consumers expecting an increase
in income dropped to 12.7 percent from 14.8 percent, while those
expecting a decrease rose to 16.6 percent from 15.8 percent.

"Consumer spending has rebounded in recent months but increasing
concerns amongst consumers about the economic outlook and their
financial well-being will likely cause spending to cool in the months
ahead," said Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The
Conference Board.

On Friday, the University of Michigan is scheduled to release its
revised reading on consumer sentiment in the month of August.

The consumer sentiment index for August is currently expected to be
unrevised from the preliminary reading of 72.8, which was up slightly
from 72.5 in July.
