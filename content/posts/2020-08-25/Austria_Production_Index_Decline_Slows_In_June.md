Austria's production index declined at a softer pace in June, amid a
fall in both industrial production and construction output, data from
Statistics Austria showed on Tuesday.

The production index decreased 10.3 percent year-on-year in June,
following a 14.3 percent fall in May.

Production in the metal industry, machine and vehicle construction, and
mineral oil processing has been declining from the previous year, since
March, the agency said.

Industrial production fell 11.5 percent annually in June and
construction output decreased 6.8 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, the production index rose 5.0 percent in
June, after a 8.5 percent gain in the prior month.

On a monthly basis, industrial production grew 5.7 percent in June and
construction output rose 3.1 percent.
