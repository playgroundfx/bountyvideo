South Africa's leading index increased in June, survey data from the
South African Reserve Bank showed on Tuesday.

The leading index rose to 94.1 in June from 91.6 in May.

Seven of the nine components increased in June, while two decreased from
the previous month, the central bank said.

The biggest positive contributions to the movement in the composite
leading [business][1] cycle indicator came from an increases in the
number of residential building plans approved and in new passenger
vehicles sold, the bank said.

The negative contributors came from deceleration in the six-month
smoothed growth rate in the real M1 money supply and a narrowing in the
interest rate spread.

The coincident index fell to 72.6 in May from 73.2 in April.

The lagging index rose to 82.8 in May from 79.4 in the prior month.
