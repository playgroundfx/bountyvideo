New home sales in the U.S. saw another substantial increase in the month
of July, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Tuesday.

The report said new home sales spiked by 13.9 percent to an annual rate
of 901,000 in July after soaring by 15.1 percent to a rate of 791,000 in
June.

Economists had expected new home sales to climb by 1.2 percent to a rate
of 785,000 from the 776,000 originally reported for the previous month.

The much bigger than expected jump lifted new home sales to their
highest annual rate since reaching 998,000 in December of 2006.

New home sales in the Midwest led the way higher in July, skyrocketing
by 58.8 percent to an annual rate of 127,000.

The Commerce Department said new home sales in the South and West also
surged up by 13.0 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively, while new home
sales in the Northeast plunged by 23.1 percent.

The report also said the median sale price of new houses sold in July
was $330,600, down 1.9 percent from $337,000 in June but up 7.2 percent
from $308,300 in the same month a year ago.

The estimate of new homes for sale at the end of July was 299,000,
representing 4.0 months of supply at the current sales rate. The months
of supply is down from 4.6 months at the end of June.

Last Friday, the National Association of Realtors released a separate
report showing existing home sales also continued to soar in the month
of July.

NAR said existing home sales skyrocketed by a record 24.7 percent to an
annual rate of 5.86 million in July after spiking by 20.2 percent to a
revised rate of 4.70 million in June.

Economists had expected existing home sales to jump by 14.0 percent to
an annual rate of 5.38 million from the 4.72 million originally reported
for the previous month.
