Global foreign direct investment flows are set to pick up this year
after a severe slump in 2020 as economic activity across the world was
impacted by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, a UN report showed Monday.  
  
FDI flows are expected to bottom out this year and recover some lost
ground with an increase of 10-15 percent, the UNCTAD's latest World
Investment Report said.

The relatively modest recovery in global FDI projected for 2021 reflects
lingering uncertainty about access to vaccines, the emergence of virus
mutations and the reopening of economic sectors, the report said.  
  
"This would still leave FDI some 25 percent below the 2019 level," James
Zhan, UNCTAD's director of investment and enterprise, said.

"Current forecasts show a further increase in 2022 which, at the upper
bound of projections, bring FDI back to the 2019 level."

Prospects are highly uncertain and will depend on, among other factors,
the pace of economic recovery and the possibility of pandemic relapses,
the potential impact of recovery spending packages on FDI, and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
pressures, UNCTAD said.

Zhan pointed out that increased expenditures on both fixed assets and
intangibles will not translate directly into a rapid FDI rebound, as
confirmed by the sharp contrast between rosy forecasts for capex and
still-depressed greenfield project announcements.

The FDI recovery is expected to be uneven, largely driven by developed
economies helped by strong cross-border mergers and acquisitions
activity and large-scale public investment support.

Asia will continue to attract significant FDI inflows as the region has
stood out as an attractive destination for international investment
throughout the pandemic, the report said.

UNCTAD said a substantial recovery of FDI to Africa and to Latin America
and the Caribbean is unlikely in the near term.

The 35 percent slump last year due to the Covid-19 crisis was heavily
skewed towards developed economies, the report said. The total value of
FDI dropped to $1 trillion from $1.5 trillion in the previous year.

Work on existing projects was hurt by the pandemic and the consequent
lockdowns, while multinational enterprises were forced to reassess new
projects due to the prospects of a recession.

In 2020, FDIs to developed economies shrunk 58 percent, those to
developing economies deceased only 8 percent, thanks to robust flows to
Asia.

Consequently, developing economies accounted for two thirds of global
FDI, up from just under half in 2019, the report said.
