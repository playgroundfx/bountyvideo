Japan's government downgraded its economic assessment citing the impact
of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic on consumer spending and [business][2]
conditions.

In the monthly report, released Wednesday, the Cabinet Office said that
the Japanese [economy][3] shows weakness in some components further,
although it remains in picking up in a severe situation due to the Novel
Coronavirus.

Downgrading its view on household consumption, the government said
private consumption shows weakness further recently, especially in
service spending.

The government also lowered its view on business conditions, saying that
current business conditions appear to be pausing for picking up, while
some severe aspects still remain.

The report said business investment is picking up and exports continue
to increase moderately. The office repeated that industrial production
is picking up.

Concerning short-term prospects, the office observed that the economy is
expected to show movements of picking up, supported by the effects of
the policies and improvement in overseas economies while the socio-
economic activities will be resumed with taking measures to prevent the
spread of infectious diseases.
