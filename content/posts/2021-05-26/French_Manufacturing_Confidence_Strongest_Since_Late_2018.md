French manufacturing sentiment rose to its highest level in more than
two years in May, survey data from the statistical office Insee revealed
on Wednesday.

The manufacturing sentiment index advanced to 107 in May from 104 in the
previous month. Economists had forecast the score to rise moderately to
106. This was the highest score since August 2018, when the reading was
109.

Manufacturers were more confident about their personal production
prospects. The corresponding index rose to 19 from 12. At the same time,
the general production expectations index rose sharply to 18 from 3. The
score reached its highest point since the spring of 2018.

The balance concerning activity over the last three months has been
virtually stable at a high level, close to that of the beginning of
2018.

The manufacturers' opinion on the level of order books further improved
with the balance on overall order books rising to -10 from -15 in the
previous month.

The balance on foreign order books continued to increase in May. The
corresponding gauge climbed to -18 from -22.

Further, [business][1] managers improved their view of the trend in
their workforce size. The balances related to past as well as expected
changes in the workforce size rebounded, after a slight decline in
April.

The overall business confidence index that comprises the responses of
business leaders in manufacturing, construction, services, retail trade
and wholesale trade, improved in May.

At 108, the index has returned above its long-term average of 100, for
the first time since February 2020, and was even higher than before the
[health][2] crisis.
