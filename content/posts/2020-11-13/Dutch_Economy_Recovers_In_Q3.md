The Dutch [economy][1] rebounded in the second quarter as the relaxation
of Covid-19 containment measures boosted household spending, preliminary
data from Statistics Netherlands showed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 7.7 percent sequentially in the third
quarter, reversing an 8.5 percent decline seen in the second quarter and
faster than the 7 percent growth economists' had forecast.

However, the latest growth does not offset the decline in the first two
quarters.  
  
Recently reinstated social distancing measures will push down services
again in the fourth quarter, Marcel Klok, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. All in all, a general decline in GDP in the fourth
quarter seems unavoidable, as both domestic and foreign demand will take
a step back.

Data showed that more than half of the sequential growth was driven by
the 9.4 percent increase in household consumption. Government
consumption, trade balance and investments also increased in the third
quarter.

Government spending and investment gained 6.3 percent each. Exports and
imports were up 8.6 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.

On a yearly basis, GDP shrank 2.5 percent, but slower than the 9.4
percent decline posted in the second quarter.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said consumer spending
dropped at a faster rate of 3.5 percent annually in September after a
2.4 percent fall in August.

Consumers spent more on goods and less on services over the past few
months.

Another report showed that exports of goods grew 0.7 percent annually in
September, reversing a 3.6 percent fall in August. Similarly, imports
gained 1 percent, in contrast to a 0.9 percent drop in August.
