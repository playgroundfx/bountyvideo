Denmark's [economy][1] moved out of recession at a record pace in the
third quarter due to the gradual reopening of the most parts of the
economy, data released by Statistics Denmark showed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 4.9 percent sequentially, the biggest on
record, after falling 6.8 percent in the second quarter and 1.6 percent
in the first quarter. However, the economy was still well below the 2019
level.

The economy had entered a technical recession in the second quarter.

After falling sharply in the second quarter, trade, transport and
[business][2] services provided a significant contribution to quarterly
growth.

The employment indicator showed a 2.3 percent rise in employment in the
third quarter.
