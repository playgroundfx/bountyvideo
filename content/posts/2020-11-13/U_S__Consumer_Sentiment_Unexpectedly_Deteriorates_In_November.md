Reflecting a less favorable assessment of future economic prospects, the
University of Michigan released a report on Friday showing an unexpected
decrease in U.S. consumer sentiment in the month of November.

The preliminary report said the consumer sentiment index fell to 77.0 in
November after rising to a seven-month high of 81.8 in October. The
pullback came as a surprise to economists, who had expected index to
inch up to 82.0.

The unexpected decrease by the headline index came as the index of
consumer expectations tumbled to 71.3 in November from 79.2 in October.

The report showed a much more modest drop by the current economic
conditions index, which edged down to 85.8 in November from 85.9 in the
previous month.

"The outcome of the presidential election as well as the resurgence in
covid infections and deaths were responsible for the early November
decline," said Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin

"Interviews conducted following the election recorded a substantial
negative shift in the Expectations Index among Republicans, but recorded
no gain among Democrats," he added. "It is likely that Democrats' fears
about the covid resurgence offset gains in economic expectations."

On the inflation front, the report said one-year inflation expectations
crept up to 2.8 percent in November from 2.6 percent in October, while
five-year inflation expectations rose to 2.6 percent from 2.4 percent.
