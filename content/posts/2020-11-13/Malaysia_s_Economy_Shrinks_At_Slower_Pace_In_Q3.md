Malaysia's [economy][1] contracted at a slower pace in the third quarter
due to the relaxation of the Covid-19 containment measures and better
global demand, official data revealed Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 2.7 percent on a yearly basis in the third
quarter, following a record 17.1 percent decline seen in the second
quarter, the Department of Statistics reported. GDP was forecast to fall
3.2 percent.

Quarter-on-quarter, the economy registered a sharp growth of 18.2
percent, in contrast to a 16.5 percent fall seen in the second quarter.

The central bank said the economy is expected to improve further going
into 2021 in tandem with better global demand and domestic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
support.

"While a second wave of infections will weigh on growth in the fourth
quarter, we don't think it will be long before the recovery is back on
track," Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

However, if Malaysia is able contain the second wave, as others in the
region have been successful in doing, the economic impact should be
relatively small and brief, the economist noted.

The production-side breakdown of GDP showed that the slower annual fall
in GDP was driven by the recovery in manufacturing.

The manufacturing sector grew 3.3 percent, in contrast to an 18.3
percent fall in the preceding quarter. At the same time, the service
sector posted a smaller decrease of 4 percent after easing 16.2 percent
in the previous quarter.

Farm output was down 0.7 percent and construction output decreased 12.4
percent in the third quarter.

On the expenditure-side, private final consumption expenditure slid 2.1
percent, while government spending expanded 6.9 percent. Gross fixed
capital formation decreased 11.6 percent.

Exports of goods and services decreased 4.7 percent and imports were
down 7.8 percent.

In the third quarter, headline inflation registered a smaller negative
at -1.4 percent, due mainly to the higher domestic retail fuel prices,
in line with the recovery in global oil prices. Core inflation moderated
slightly to 1.0 percent.

Reflecting the higher projected global oil prices, headline inflation is
forecast to average higher next year, the central bank said. Underlying
inflation is projected to be subdued amid spare capacity in the economy.
