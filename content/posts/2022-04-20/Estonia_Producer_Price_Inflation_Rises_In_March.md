Estonia's producer price inflation increased in March mainly due to
rising prices in electricity and heat energy production, data from
Statistics Estonia showed on Wednesday.

The producer price index increased 30.3 percent year-on-year in March
after a [26.3 percent rise in February][1]. The latest rise was also
driven by higher prices in the manufacture of wood and wood products,
fabricated metal products and food products.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices rose 3.0 percent in March.

"Compared to February, the producer price index was primarily affected
by price increases in the manufacture of fuel oils, in the manufacture
of wood and wood products, in electricity production and in the
manufacture of food products," Eveli Sokman, leading analyst at
Statistics Estonia, said.

Import prices increased 3.3 percent monthly in March and gained 27.2
percent from a year ago.

Export prices also rose 2.8 percent monthly in March, and increased 23.5
percent yearly.
