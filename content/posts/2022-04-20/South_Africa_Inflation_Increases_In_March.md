South Africa's consumer price inflation accelerated for the first time
in three months in March, figures from Statistics South Africa showed on
Wednesday.

The consumer price index grew 5.9 percent year-on-year in March,
following a 5.7 percent rise in February and January.

Economists had expected a rate of 6.0 percent. Same rate of inflation
was seen in December.

The main contribution came from prices of food and non-alcoholic
beverages, housing and utilities, transport, and miscellaneous goods and
services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased 6.2 percent
annually in March and the housing and utilities cost rose 4.8 percent.

Prices of transport, and miscellaneous goods and services grew 15.7
percent and 3.2 percent, respectively.

In March, inflation for goods rose 8.7 percent and those for services
was 3.4 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices rose 1.0 percent in March.
This was in line with economists' expectations.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, climbed to 3.8 percent in March from 3.5 percent in
February. Economists had forecast 3.7 percent.

On a monthly basis, the core CPI rose 0.8 percent in March, while
economists' expected a 0.7 percent increase.
