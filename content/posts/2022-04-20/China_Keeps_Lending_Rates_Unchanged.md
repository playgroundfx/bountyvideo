China left its benchmark lending rates unchanged on Wednesday,
confounding expectations for a reduction, as the People's Bank of China
opted for a more cautious stance to further easing.

The one-year loan prime rate, or LPR, was retained at 3.70 percent and
the five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage rates, was maintained at
4.60 percent.

Although the one-year medium-term lending facility, the forerunner of
LPR, was kept unchanged last week, economists expected a slight
reduction in the LPR today.

The previous change in the one-year loan-prime rate was a 5 basis points
cut in January, which was the second consecutive reduction.

The LPR is fixed monthly based on the submission of 18 banks, though
Beijing has influence over the rate-setting. This lending rate replaced
the central bank's traditional benchmark lending rate in August 2019.

For now, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are mostly relying on targeted measures to help
support firms hit by the latest virus wave, economists at Capital
Economics said.

The reluctance to embrace more wholesale easing suggests that a strong
stimulus-led rebound of the kind we saw in 2020 is not likely this year,
economists added.

The central bank announced relief measures to companies and households
affected by the lockdown, on Monday. This included ensuring enough
supply of funds to small and medium-sized companies.

Last week, the PBoC lowered the reserve requirement ratio by 0.25
percentage points. The reduction freed up CNY 530 billion in long-term
liquidity. The weighted average RRR for Chinese financial institutions
now stands at 8.1 percent.

Official data showed on Monday that the Chinese [economy][1] expanded at
a faster pace of 4.8 percent in the first quarter despite the COVID-19
pandemic restrictions hitting consumption and heightened geopolitical
risks.

That said, the retail sales and industrial production data for the month
of March were tepid suggesting weakness in coming months in the backdrop
of supply disruptions due to the lockdown restrictions in some regions
to curb a fresh wave of Covid infections.

For the whole year of 2022, the government targets around 5.5 percent
growth.

The International Monetary Fund, on Tuesday, downgraded China's growth
forecast for this year to 4.4 percent from 4.8 percent. The outlook for
next year was trimmed to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent.
