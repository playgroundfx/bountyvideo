Japan posted a merchandise trade deficit of 412.4 billion yen in March,
the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday

That missed expectations for a shortfall of 100.8 billion yen following
the downwardly revised 669.7 billion yen in February (originally -668.3
billion yen).

Exports were up 14.7 percent on year - shy of expectations for an
increase of 17.5 percent and down from 19.1 percent in the previous
month.

Imports jumped an annual 31.2 percent versus forecasts for a gain of
28.9 percent and down from an upwardly revised 34.1 percent spike a
month earlier (originally 34.0 percent).
