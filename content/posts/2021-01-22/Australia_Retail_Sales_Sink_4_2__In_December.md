The total value of retail sales in Australia were down a seasonally
adjusted 4.2 percent on month in December, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Friday - coming in at A$30.324 billion.

That missed expectations for a decline of 2.5 percent following the 7.1
percent jump in November.

Following the November rise, all industries except for Cafes,
restaurants and takeaway food services fell.

Household goods retailing led the falls (-9%), following the Black
Friday sales, and new product releases, that boosted turnover in
November.

Similarly, Other retailing, Department stores, and Clothing, footwear
and personal accessory retailing, saw falls after reporting large rises
in November.

Food retailing fell 2%, with sales across the Food industry down in
Victoria and New South Wales in line with restrictions on Christmas
gatherings.
