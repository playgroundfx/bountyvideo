Existing home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly rebounded in the month of
December, according to a report released by the National Association of
Realtors on Friday.

NAR said existing home sales climbed by 0.7 percent to an annual rate of
6.76 million in December after tumbling by 2.2 percent to a revised rate
of 6.71 million in November.

The rebound surprised economists, who had expected existing home sales
to slump by 2.1 percent to a rate of 6.55 million from the 6.69 million
originally reported for the previous month.

With the unexpected monthly increase, existing home sales in December
were up by 22.2 percent compared to the same month a year ago.

"Home sales rose in December, and for 2020 as a whole, we saw sales
perform at their highest levels since 2006, despite the pandemic," said
Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.

He added, "What's even better is that this momentum is likely to carry
into the new year, with more buyers expected to enter the market."

The report said the existing home price for all housing types was
$309,800 in December, up 2.9 percent year-over-year.

Housing inventory at the end of December totaled 1.07 million units,
down 16.4 percent from November. The unsold inventory represents an all-
time low of 1.9 months of supply at the current sales pace.

Looking ahead, Yun expects to see a continuation of the strong activity
that's currently taking place in the housing market and in the overall
[economy][1].

"Although mortgage rates are projected to increase, they will continue
to hover near record lows at around 3%," Yun said.

He added, "Moreover, expect economic conditions to improve with
additional stimulus forthcoming and vaccine distribution already
underway."

Next Thursday, the Commerce Department is expected to release a separate
report on new home sales in the month of December.

Economists currently expect new home sales to jump by 2.7 percent in
December after plunging by 11.0 percent in November.
