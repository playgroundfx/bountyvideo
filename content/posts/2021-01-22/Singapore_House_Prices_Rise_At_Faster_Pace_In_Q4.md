Singapore house prices increased at a faster pace in the fourth quarter,
the Urban Redevelopment Authority reported Friday.

House prices grew 2.1 percent on a yearly basis, faster than the 0.8
percent increase seen in the previous quarter.

However, in 2020 as a whole, house price inflation slowed to 2.2 percent
from 2.7 percent in 2019.

Further, data showed that prices of landed properties dropped 1.6, while
prices of non-landed properties advanced 3.0 percent in the fourth
quarter. For the whole of 2020, prices of landed properties climbed 1.2
percent and those of non-landed properties were up 2.5 percent.

In the fourth quarter, rentals of houses edged up 0.1 percent, reversing
a 0.5 percent fall in the previous quarter.
