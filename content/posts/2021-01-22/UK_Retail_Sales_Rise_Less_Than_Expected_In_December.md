UK retail sales recovered in December but the pace of growth was much
slower than expected, data released by the Office for National
Statistics showed Friday.

The retail sales volume gained 0.3 percent month-on-month, reversing a
4.1 percent decline seen in November. However, the pace of growth was
weaker than the economists forecast of +1.2 percent.

Sales increased by 2.7 percent from the February's pre-lockdown level.

Clothing stores reported strong monthly growth of 21.5 percent,
rebounding from a large fall in November, when stores were closed
because of [coronavirus][1] restrictions.

Excluding auto fuel, the retail sales volume gained 0.4 percent on
month, in contrast to a 3 percent fall in November. Sales were forecast
to gain 0.8 percent.

On a yearly basis, retail sales growth improved to 2.9 percent from 2.1
percent in November. Economists had forecast an annual growth of 4
percent.

Excluding auto fuel, retail sales were up 6.4 percent, faster than the
5.3 percent rise logged a month ago but slower than the 7 percent
increase economists' had forecast.

In 2020 as a whole, retail sales volume decreased by 1.9 percent,
marking the largest annual fall on record.
