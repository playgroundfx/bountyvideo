The UK private sector logged a renewed downturn in January as the third
lockdown dampened the services [economy][1] and trimmed the
manufacturing growth, flash survey results from IHS Markit and the
Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed Friday.

The flash composite output index fell sharply to an eight-month low of
40.6 in January from 50.4 in December.

Moreover, a reading below 50 indicates contraction. The score was
forecast to rise to 50.7. Nonetheless, the speed of the downturn in the
private sector output was softer than at the start of the pandemic.

"A steep slump in [business][2] activity in January puts the lockeddown
UK economy on course to contract sharply in the first quarter of 2021,
meaning a double-dip recession is on the cards," Chris Williamson, chief
business economist at IHS Markit, said.

The composite PMI points to a fall in GDP in January of about 5 percent
month-on-month, Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said.  
  
This suggests that the fall in GDP in January could be almost double the
size of November's 2.6 percent decline, the economist noted. Although
that drop would be mild in the context of the 18.8 percent monthly
decline seen during the first lockdown in April 2020.

The service economy was hard-hit by restrictions on trade and reduced
consumer spending at the start of the year. At the same time, the
manufacturing sector grew at the slowest pace since mid 2020.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index plunged unexpectedly to 38.8
from 49.4 a month ago. The expected level was 49.9.

At 52.9, the manufacturing PMI dropped to a seven-month low from 57.5 in
December and was much weaker than the expected reading of 57.3.

Lower levels of new orders, reduced employment and a swift depletion of
pre-production inventories were the main factors weighing on the
headline manufacturing PMI. There was a shortage of critical
manufacturing inputs due to Brexit disruptions and a severe lack of
international shipping availability.

At the composite level, volumes of new work decreased for the fourth
consecutive month in January due to weak consumer spending.

Strong cost pressures persisted at the start of 2021, with the overall
rate of inflation holding close to December's 11-month peak.

Higher operating expenses, squeezed margins and lower demand also
contributed to a moderate acceleration in the pace of private sector job
shedding in January.  
  
Driven by vaccine roll-out, business expectations for the next 12 months
picked up slightly since December, reaching its highest since May 2014.
