Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it should prepare to respond
to the new payment and settlement systems and the future need for
digital currency.

Although the bank has not changed its stance that it "currently has no
plan to issue central bank digital currency," it is important to prepare
thoroughly to respond to changes in circumstances in an appropriate
manner, Kuroda said in a video message.

The banker said central banks share the view that it is not an
appropriate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response to start considering CBDC only when the need
to issue CBDC arises in the future.
