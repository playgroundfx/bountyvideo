With steep drops in manufacturing and mining output more than offsetting
a sharp increase in utilities output, the Federal Reserve released a
report on Tuesday showing an unexpected slump in U.S. industrial
production in the month of February.

The Fed said industrial production tumbled by 2.2 percent in February
after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.1 percent in January.

The pullback surprised economists, who had expected industrial
production to climb by 0.6 percent compared to the 0.9 percent increase
originally reported for the previous month.

The unexpected decrease in industrial production came as manufacturing
output plunged by 3.1 percent in February after surging up by 1.2
percent in January.

Mining output also showed a substantial pullback during the month,
plummeting by 5.4 percent in February following a 2.1 percent spike in
January.

The Fed said the severe winter weather in the south central region of
the country in mid-February accounted for the bulk of the declines in
output for the month.

Excluding the effects of the winter weather, the central bank said
manufacturing output would have dipped by just 0.5 percent and mining
output would have risen by 0.5 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed utilities output soared by 7.4 percent in
February after falling by 0.6 percent in the previous month.

"With the weather returning to seasonal norms in March, all those
distortions should be reversed soon, and the latest survey evidence
suggests that underlying manufacturing demand remains strong," said
Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "The big concern, however, is that the supply problems evident
in the auto industry are the tip of the iceberg of more widespread
global supply constraints that will prevent output from closing the gap
with goods demand, especially with the latter set to be boosted by the
latest round of stimulus checks."

The Fed also said capacity utilization for the industrial sector dropped
to 73.8 percent in February from a revised 75.5 percent in January.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to inch up to 75.8 percent
from the 56.6 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and mining sectors fell to
72.3 percent and 77.5 percent, respectively, while capacity utilization
in the utilities sector jumped to 78.5 percent.
