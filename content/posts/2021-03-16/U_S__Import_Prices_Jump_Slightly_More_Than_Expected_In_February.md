With fuel prices continuing to skyrocket, the Labor Department released
a report on Tuesday showing another jump in U.S. import prices in the
month of February.

The report showed import prices increased by 1.3 percent in February
after surging up by 1.4 percent in January. Economists had expected
import prices to climb by 1.2 percent.

The Labor Department said export prices also shot up by 1.6 percent in
February following a 2.5 percent spike in January. Export prices were
expected to increase by 0.9 percent.
