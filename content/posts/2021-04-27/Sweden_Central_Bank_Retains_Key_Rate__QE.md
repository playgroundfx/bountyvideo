Sweden's central bank retained its key interest rate and the asset
purchase programme on Tuesday, to support economic recovery and subdued
inflation.

The Executive Board of Riksbank decided to hold the repo rate at zero
percent. The rate is set to remain at the current level in the coming
years.

The board also kept the envelope of the asset purchase programme
unchanged at SEK 700 billion.

The bank vowed to design monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) so that it supports the
recovery and inflation as long as necessary.

The economic outlook is slightly brighter now than it was in February,
but the pandemic is not over, and inflationary pressures remain low, the
bank said.

The growth outlook for 2021 was downgraded to 3.7 percent from 3 percent
and the 2022 forecast to 3.6 percent from 3.9 percent. The growth for
2023 was seen at 2 percent instead of 2.4 percent.

According to Riksbank, total economic activity will approach more normal
levels towards the end of the year.

The bank said it will take time before inflation is more permanently
close to the target of 2 percent.

Inflation is forecast to rise to 1.4 percent this year and then to 1.5
percent in 2022 and 1.7 percent in 2023. The projections for 2021 and
2022 were lifted from 1.3 percent, while that for 2023 was downgraded
from 1.8 percent.
