Import prices advanced 1.4 percent year-on-year in February, reversing a

prices since April 2019.  
  
Economists had forecast an annual growth of 1.1 percent for February.

On a monthly basis, import price inflation slowed to 1.7 percent from
1.9 percent in the previous month.

Excluding energy, import prices advanced 1 percent on both monthly and
annual comparison. Energy prices advanced 5.2 percent from last year.

Export prices grew 0.7 percent year-on-year, following a 0.1 percent
