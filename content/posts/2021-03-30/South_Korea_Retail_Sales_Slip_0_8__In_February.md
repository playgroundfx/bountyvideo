The value of retail sales in South Korea was down a seasonally adjusted
0.8 percent on month in February, Statistics Korea said on Wednesday.

That missed expectations for a decline of 0.3 percent following the 1.6
percent increase in January.

On a yearly basis, retail sales climbed 8.4 percent - exceeding
expectations for a gain of 5.0 percent following the flat reading in the
previous month.
