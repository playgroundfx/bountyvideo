level in three months as households' expectations regarding their
financial situation outlook strengthened and the saving intentions hit a
record high.

data from INSEE showed Tuesday. Economists had expected the index
reading to remain unchanged.

The latest score was the highest since December's 95, but remained below
the long-term average of 100.

The measure reflecting households' opinion on their future financial
situation rose four points to -4, which was above its long-term average.  
  
The index mirroring their assessment of the past financial situation
gained one point and remained above its average.

Households were less pessimistic on making big purchases and the
relevant measure climbed to -15 to -17.  
  
The index for savings intentions for next 12 months rose sharply to a
record high 42 from 39. While the index measuring the current saving
capacity was unchanged at 25, the gauge for future saving capacity
decreased to 9 from 11.  
  
A sharp improvement was witnessed in the households expectations on the
standard of living in future and the measure jumped sixteen points.

high and above average. Households' inflation expectations increased.
