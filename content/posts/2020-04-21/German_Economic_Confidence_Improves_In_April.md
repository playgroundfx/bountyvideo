German economic confidence improved strongly in April, survey data from
the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research showed Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment advanced 77.7 points to 28.2
points in April. This was well above the forecast of -42.3.

Meanwhile, the current conditions index plunged 48.4 points to -91.5
points. The expected reading was -77.5.

This constellation of values currently witnessed for expectations and
the assessment of the current situation roughly corresponds to that seen
in April/May 2009 during the financial crisis, ZEW said.

ZEW President Achim Wambach said the financial market experts are
beginning to see a light at the end of the very long tunnel.

The results of the special questions on the [coronavirus][1] crisis
included in the survey show that the experts do not expect to see
positive economic growth until the third quarter of 2020, Wambach added.
