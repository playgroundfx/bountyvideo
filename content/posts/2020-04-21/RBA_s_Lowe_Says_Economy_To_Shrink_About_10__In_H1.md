Reserve Bank of Australia's Governor Philip Lowe on Tuesday said the
[economy][1] is set to experience the biggest contraction in national
output and income since the 1930s due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lowe expects the national output to fall by around 10 percent over the
first half of 2020, with most of this decline taking place in the June
quarter.

The unemployment rate is likely to be around 10 percent by June, Lowe
noted. However, the rate might be lower than this if businesses are able
to retain their employees on lower hours.

Further, he cautioned that as the economic data roll in over coming
months, they will present a very sobering picture of the state of the
economy. There will be many reports of record declines in economic
activity, the banker added.

"Whatever the timing of the recovery, when it does come, we should not
be expecting that we will return quickly to [business][2] as usual,"
said Lowe.

In March, the Reserve Bank had reduced the cash rate to a record low of
0.25 percent and targeted to bring the yield on three-year government
bonds at around 0.25 percent. Also the bank introduced a three-year
funding facility to help small and medium sized firms.
