Switzerland's exports declined for a second straight month and at a
faster pace in March, mainly due to massive fall in shipments of
machinery and electronics and watches, that offset the strong demand for
chemical and pharmaceutical products amid the [coronavirus][1] pandemic,
data from the Federal Customs Administration showed on Tuesday.

Exports decreased by a real 4.0 percent month-on-month in March,
following a 3.1 percent fall in February. Shipments of machinery and
electronics slumped 18 percent, while demand for chemical and
pharmaceutical products grew 6.6 percent.

Watch exports fell for a second straight month, down 13.4 percent from
February.

Imports declined 6.7 percent monthly in March, following a 0.4 percent
fall in the previous month.

The fall was driven by a 17.9 percent drop in imports of vehicles. This
in turn was led by a massive 62.9 percent decline in demand for the
aerospace imports.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports increased 2.2 percent in March and imports
fell 3.9 percent.

On a quarterly basis, exports declined by a real 0.6 percent in the
first quarter, following a 2.6 percent decrease in the fourth quarter.

Imports fell 3.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter,
following a 3.1 percent decrease in the previous fourth months.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports rose 1.0 percent in the first quarter and
imports fell 2.8 percent.

The trade surplus increased to CHF 8.342 billion in the first quarter
from CHF 6.328 billion in the previous quarter.

Exports increased due to the significant growth of chemical-
pharmaceuticals in March and in the first quarter, the agency said.

The increase in this branch is mainly due to the Covid-19 outbreak in
the environment of the global economic situation and this covered the
mostly declining development in the other branches of industry, the
agency reported.

According to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, watch exports
dropped 21.9 percent year-on-year in March.

The 43.1 percent fall in volumes is more representative, on average, of
the real state of the watch market, the group said.

The industry body expects watch exports to fall again in April due to
the weak demand in main [markets][2] as most are under lock-down to slow
the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
