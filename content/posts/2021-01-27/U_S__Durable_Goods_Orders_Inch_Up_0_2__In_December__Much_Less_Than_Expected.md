After reporting a notable increase in new orders for U.S. manufactured
durable goods in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a
report on Wednesday showing durable goods orders rose by much less than
expected in the month of December.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders edged up by 0.2
percent in December after surging by an upwardly revised 1.2 percent in
November.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to increase by 0.9 percent
compared to the 1.0 percent jump that had been reported for the previous
month.

The weaker than expected growth was partly due to a pullback in orders
for transportation equipment, which slumped by 1.0 percent in December
after spiking by 1.9 percent in November.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts showed a particularly steep
drop during the month, plummeting by 51.8 percent.

Excluding the decrease in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders climbed by 0.7 percent in December after advancing by 0.8
percent in November. Ex-transportation orders were expected to rise by
0.5 percent.

The increase in ex-transportation orders was partly due to a 2.4 percent
jump in orders for machinery as well as more modest upticks in orders
for fabricated metal products and primary metals.

The report also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a closely watched indicated of [business][1] spending, rose by
0.6 percent in December after climbing by 1.0 percent in November.

"The weaker 0.2% gain in headline durable goods orders in December was
mainly due to ongoing problems among aircraft manufacturers and a drop
off in defense orders," said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at
Capital Economics.

He added, "The bigger story is the continued strong gains in core
orders, which underlines that the recovery in business equipment
investment - which looks set to rise above its pre-pandemic level in the
fourth quarter - still has plenty of momentum."

The Commerce Department also said shipments of durable goods increased
for the seventh time in eight months, jumping by 1.4 percent in December
after rising by 0.4 percent in November.
