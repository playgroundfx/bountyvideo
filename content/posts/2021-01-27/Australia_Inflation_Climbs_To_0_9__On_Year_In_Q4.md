Consumer prices in Australia were up 0.9 percent on year in the fourth
quarter of 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday -
exceeding expectations for 0.7 percent, which would have been unchanged
from Q3.

On a quarterly basis, inflation also gained 0.9 percent - beating
forecasts for 0.7 percent and down from 1.6 percent in the three months
prior.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's trimmed mean was up 0.4 percent on
quarter and 1.2 percent on year - both matching forecasts and unchanged.

The weighted median rose 0.5 percent on quarter and 1.4 percent on year
after rising 0.3 percent on quarter and 1.3 percent on year in the
previous three months.
