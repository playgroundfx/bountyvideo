Poland's jobless rate rose for the first time in seven months in
December, as expected, figures from the statistical office showed on
Wednesday.

The unemployment rate climbed to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent in
November. The increase was in line with economists' expectations.

The rate had remained at 6.1 percent since June.

The number of registered unemployed rose to 1.05 billion from 1.03
billion in the previous month.

The number of newly registered unemployed in December was 105,400
persons, which was higher than that in November.
