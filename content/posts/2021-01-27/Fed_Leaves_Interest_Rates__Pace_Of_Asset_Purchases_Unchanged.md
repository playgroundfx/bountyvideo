In its first monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision of the New Year, the Federal
Reserve left interest rates unchanged as widely expected on Wednesday
and revealed it plans to maintain its asset purchase program at the
current pace.

The Fed said it decided to keep the target range for the federal funds
rate at zero to 0.25 percent and once again said it expects to leave
rates at near-zero levels until labor market conditions reach levels
consistent with maximum employment and inflation is on track to
moderately exceed 2 percent.

The more closely watched section of the Fed's accompanying statement
revealed that the central bank plans to continue purchasing bonds at a
rate of at least $120 billion per month.

The statement reiterated the assertion first made last month, when the
Fed said it will maintain asset purchases at the current rate until
"substantial further progress" has been made toward its goals of maximum
employment and price stability.

"We don't expect the Fed to begin tapering its asset purchases until
early next year and think the first rate hike could be delayed until
2024," said Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

In one of the few changes to the statement, the Fed said pace of the
economic recovery has moderated in recent months, with weakness
concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the ongoing
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The December statement said economic activity and employment have
continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning
of the year.

The latest statement also referenced the rollout of coronavirus
vaccines, noting the path of the [economy][2] will depend significantly
on the course of the coronavirus, including progress on vaccinations.

The Fed reiterated that it will continue to monitor the implications of
incoming information for the economic outlook and be prepared to adjust
the stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as appropriate if risks emerge that could
impede the attainment of its goals.
