Industrial output in Japan climbed a seasonally adjusted 8.0 percent on
month in July, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on
Monday.

That beat forecasts for a gain of 5.8 percent and was up from 1.9
percent in June.

On a yearly basis, industrial production sank 16.1 percent - missing
forecasts for a decline of 15.0 percent after tumbling 18.2 percent in
the previous month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI upgraded its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it is showing signs of picking up.

Industries that contributed to the increase were motor vehicles, other
manufacturing and non-ferrous metals - offset by declines among
production machinery, transport equipment and petroleum and coal
products.

Shipments were up 6.0 percent on month and down 17.1 percent on year,
while inventories dipped 1.6 percent on month and 4.9 percent on year.
The inventory ratio dropped 8.8 percent on month and jumped 17.8 percent
on year.

According to the METI's forecast of production, output is expected to
rise 4.0 percent in August and 1.9 percent in September. Gains in August
are linked to transport equipment, [business][1]-oriented machinery and
chemicals. In September, gains are expected from transport equipment,
electrical machinery and paper.

Also on Monday, the METI said that the total value of retail sales in
Japan was down a seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent on month in July. That
missed forecasts for a gain of 3 percent and was down from 13.1 percent
in June.

On a yearly basis, retail sales sank 2.8 percent - again shy of
expectations for a decline of 1.7 percent following the 3.9 percent
increase in the previous month.
