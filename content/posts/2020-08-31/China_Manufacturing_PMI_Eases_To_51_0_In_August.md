The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in August, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from the National Bureau of
Statistics said on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.0.

That missed expectations for a reading of 51.2 and it's down from 51.1
in July. It does, however, remain above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that
separates expansion from contraction.

The NBS also said on Monday that its mom-manufacturing index came in
with a score of 55.2 - beating forecasts for 55.0 and up from 54.2 in
the previous month.
