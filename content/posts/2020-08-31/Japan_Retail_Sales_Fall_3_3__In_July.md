The total value of retail sales in Japan was down a seasonally adjusted
3.3 percent on month in July, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry said on Monday.

That missed forecasts for a gain of 3 percent and was down from 13.1
percent in June.

On a yearly basis, retail sales sank 2.8 percent - again shy of
expectations for a decline of 1.7 percent following the 3.9 percent
increase in the previous month.
