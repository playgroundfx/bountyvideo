Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing private
sector employment in the U.S. increased by less than expected in the
month of November.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 307,000 jobs in November
after climbing by an upwardly revised 404,000 jobs in October.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 410,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 365,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

"While November saw employment gains, the pace continues to slow," said
Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute.
