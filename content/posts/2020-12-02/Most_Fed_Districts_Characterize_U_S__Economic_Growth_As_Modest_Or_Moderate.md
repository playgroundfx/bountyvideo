Economic growth in the U.S. has been characterized as modest or moderate
by most Federal Reserve districts, according to the Fed's Beige Book
released on Wednesday.

However, the Fed said four of the twelve districts described little or
no growth, and five narratives noted that activity remained below pre-
pandemic levels for at least some sectors.

The central bank also cautioned that Philadelphia and three of the four
Midwestern Districts observed that activity began to slow in early
November as new [coronavirus][1] cases surged.

A compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic conditions in the twelve
Fed districts, the Beige Book is typically released about two weeks
before the next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting.

The Fed said reports from the districts tended to indicate higher-than-
average growth of manufacturing, distribution and logistics,
homebuilding, and existing home sales, although not without disruptions.

Banking [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s in numerous districts also reported some deterioration
of loan portfolios, particularly for commercial lending into the retail
and leisure and hospitality sectors, the Fed said.

The Beige Book said nearly all Fed districts reported job growth, but
for most, the pace was slow, at best, and the recovery remained
incomplete.

Looking ahead, the central bank said that most districts reported that
firms' outlook for the [economy][2] remained positive.

Optimism has waned, however, with many [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s citing concerns over the
recent pandemic wave, mandated restrictions and the looming expiration
dates for unemployment benefits and for moratoriums on evictions and
foreclosures.
