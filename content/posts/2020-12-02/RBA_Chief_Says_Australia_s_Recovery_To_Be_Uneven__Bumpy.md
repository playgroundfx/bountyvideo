Australia's economic recovery will be uneven and bumpy, Reserve Bank of
Australia Governor Philip Lowe said Wednesday.

The economic growth is set to be solidly positive in the third and
fourth quarters, Lowe told a parliamentary committee. The central bank
expects the [economy][1] to grow 5 percent next year and then 4 percent
over 2022.

And even with the overall economy now growing solidly, it will not be
until the end of 2021 that GDP reach the pre-pandemic level of output,
Lowe said.

"These figures, though, cannot hide the reality that the recovery will
be uneven and bumpy and that it will be drawn out," Lowe added. Some
parts of the economy are doing quite well, but others are in
considerable difficulty.

The unemployment rate is expected to be still above 6 percent in two
years' time, he noted. Due to higher unemployment, wage and price
pressures are likely to remain subdued. And underlying inflation is seen
at just 1 percent next year and 1.5 percent in 2022, said Lowe.

Official data released earlier in the day showed that the Australian
economy exited recession in the third quarter. GDP grew 3.3 percent
sequentially after falling 7 percent in the second quarter.
