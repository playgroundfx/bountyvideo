The services sector in Australia continued to expand in November, and at
a faster rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Thursday with a seasonally adjusted PMI score of 55.1.

That's up from 53.7 in October and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, mew [business][1] growth accelerated, while job creation
resumed and business confidence remained at a high level.

Input prices rose for a sixth month running, with the pace of inflation
accelerating to a two-year high.

The survey also showed that the composite index improved to 54.9 in
November, up from 53.5 a month earlier.
