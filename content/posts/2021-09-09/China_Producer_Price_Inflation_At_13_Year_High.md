China producer price inflation accelerated to a 13-year high in August
on higher commodity prices, while consumer price inflation slowed
unexpectedly, official data showed on Thursday.

Producer prices advanced 9.5 percent annually, following an increase of
9 percent in July, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. The
latest growth was the biggest since August 2008. Prices were forecast to
climb again by 9 percent.

Month-on-month, producer prices grew 0.7 percent in August.

Consumer price inflation rose to 0.8 percent in August from 1 percent in
July, the NBS said in a separate communiqu√©. The rate was forecast to
remain unchanged at 1 percent.

The government targets consumer price inflation of around 3 percent for
2021.  
On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent, much slower
than the expected rate of 0.5 percent.

Core consumer price inflation, which strips out volatile items such as
food and energy, eased marginally to 1.2 percent in August from 1.3
percent in July.

Food prices were down 4.1 percent, following a 3.7 percent decrease in
the July. Non-food prices advanced 1.9 percent after increasing 2.1
percent in July.

The breakdown of producer prices suggests that upward pressure on the
factory-gate prices of consumer goods is easing, Julian Evans-Pritchard
and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital Economics, said. PPI inflation is
likely to ease before long.

The economists noted that headline consumer price inflation should
remain below 2 percent in the coming quarters and is unlikely to
constrain the People's Bank of China's ability to loosen [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
