Malaysia's central bank decided to leave its key interest rates
unchanged, as widely expected, on Thursday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to
maintain the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 1.75 percent.

Policymakers observed that the further easing of containment measures,
rapid progress of the domestic vaccination programme and continued
expansion in global demand will support the growth momentum going into
2022.

Nonetheless, risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside
due to external and domestic factors.

Headline inflation is projected to average between 2.0 percent and 3.0
percent for 2021. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation,
is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5 percent and 1.5
percent for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the [economy][1].

Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the MPC repeated that
the stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will continue to be determined by new data
and information and their implications on the overall outlook for
inflation and domestic growth.

Although the economy should start to rebound now that virus restrictions
are being eased, output is likely to remain below potential for some
time to come, Alex Holmes and Gareth Leather, economists at Capital
Economics, said.

The economist said the upshot is that interest rates are likely to
remain on hold for some time to come, and financial [markets][2] are
getting well ahead of themselves by pricing in a 25 basis point hike in
the middle of next year.
