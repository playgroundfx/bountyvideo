The Mainland-Norway [economy][1] grew at a slower pace in July, data
from Statistics Norway showed on Thursday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent on month in July, much slower
than the 0.8 percent expansion posted in June.

Total GDP expanded 0.7 percent from June, when it was up 0.9 percent.

The slowdown in economic growth was largely driven by the fall in gross
fixed capital formation. GFCF was down 1.4 percent. Household spending
rose 2.6 percent, while government spending grew only 0.1 percent.

Exports advanced 1.8 percent from the last month. By contrast, imports
slid 3.5 percent.

The statistical office said the Mainland GDP was 0.5 percent higher than
in February 2020, which was the last month before the pandemic hit
Norway.
