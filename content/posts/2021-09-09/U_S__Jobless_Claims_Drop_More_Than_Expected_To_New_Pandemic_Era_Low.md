After last Friday's disappointing monthly jobs report, the Labor
Department released a report on Thursday showing a bigger than expected
decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended September 4th.

The report said initial jobless claims fell to 310,000, a decrease of
35,000 from the previous week's revised level of 345,000. Economists had
expected jobless claims to edge down to 335,000 from the 340,000
originally reported for the previous week.

With the bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims once again
dropped to their lowest level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended
March 14, 2020.

The less volatile four-week moving average also dipped to a new
pandemic-era low of 339,500, a decrease of 16,750 from the previous
week's revised average of 356,250.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also fell by 22,000 to 2.783 million in the
week ended August 28th, hitting the lowest level since March of 2020.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also dropped to a more
than one-year low of 2,840,250, a decrease of 29,000 from the previous
week's revised average of 2,869,250.

"While the August jobs report showed employers may have hit the pause
button on hiring amid renewed concerns about the pandemic, the claims
data suggest a reluctance to lay off workers amid a record number of job
openings," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Capital
Economics.

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
U.S. job growth fell well short of economic estimates in the month of
August.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 235,000
jobs in August after soaring by an upwardly revised 1.053 million jobs
in July.

Economists had expected employment to jump by about 750,000 jobs
compared to the spike of 943,000 jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

Despite the much weaker than expected job growth, the unemployment rate
fell to 5.2 percent in August from 5.4 percent in July, matching
economist estimates.
