New Zealand will on Friday release August figures for electronic retail
card spending, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

Spending is expected to have risen 1.7 percent on month and 11.4 percent
on year after gaining 0.6 percent on month and 4.7 percent on year in
July.

Australia will see consumer inflation expectations for September; in
August, the forecast suggested an increase of 3.3 percent on year.
