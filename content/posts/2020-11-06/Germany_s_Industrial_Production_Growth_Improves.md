Germany's industrial production growth accelerated in September, albeit
at slower than expected pace ahead of new restrictions imposed to
contain the [coronavirus][1], data released by Destatis showed on
Friday.

Industrial output climbed 1.6 percent on month, bigger than the revised
0.5 percent rise seen in August but slower than economists' forecast of
2.7 percent.

Excluding energy and construction, production in industry was up 2.0
percent in September.

Within industry, production of intermediate goods showed an increase of
1.4 percent. Output of consumer goods advanced 3.0 percent and that of
capital goods by 2.2 percent.

Production in the automotive industry, the largest segment of
manufacturing, grew 10 percent on the previous month.

Outside industry, energy production was down 2.5 percent, while
construction output grew 1.5 percent.

Data showed that annual fall in industrial production came in at 7.3
percent in September. However, this was slower than the 8.7 percent fall
logged in August.

Compared with February, the month before restrictions were imposed due
to the corona pandemic in Germany, production were 8.4 percent lower in
seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

Given the sentiment impact from the latest lockdown measures but also
weaker foreign demand as many other eurozone countries have also gone
into lockdown again, this positive momentum in industrial production
will not be enough to avoid double dip for the German [economy][2],
Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said.
