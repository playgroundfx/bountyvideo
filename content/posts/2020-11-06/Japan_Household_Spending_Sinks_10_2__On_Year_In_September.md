The average of household spending in Japan was down 10.2 percent on year
in September, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said
on Friday - coming in at 269,863 yen.

That beat forecasts for a decline of 10.7 percent following the 6.9
percent drop in August.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 469,235 yen, up 2.6
percent on year.

Individually, spending on furniture, clothing, medical care and
recreation all were down sharply.

On a monthly basis, household spending rose 3.8 percent - beating
forecasts for a gain of 2.2 percent following the 1.7 percent gain a
month earlier.
