UK house prices increased at the fastest pace since mid-2016, data
released by the Lloyds Bank subsidiary Halifax and IHS Markit showed
Friday.

House prices increased 7.5 percent on a yearly basis in three months to
October from the same period last year, the strongest rise since June
2016. Prices had advanced 7.3 percent in three months to September.

On a monthly basis, house price inflation slowed to 0.3 percent from 1.5
percent in September.

Russell Galley, Managing Director, Halifax, said for the first time in
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), average house price exceeded a quarter of a million pounds.

"This level of price inflation is underpinned by unusually high levels
of demand, with latest industry figures showing home-buyer mortgage
approvals at their highest level since 2007, as transaction levels
continue to be supercharged by pent-up demand as a result of the
spring/summer lockdown, as well as the Chancellor's waiver on stamp duty
for properties up to GBP 500,000," Galley added.

With a number of clear headwinds facing the housing market, Halifax
expects to see greater downward pressure on house prices moving into
2021.
