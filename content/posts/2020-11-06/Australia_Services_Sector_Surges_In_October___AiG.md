The services sector in Australia swung to expansion in October, the
latest survey from the Australian Industry Group showed on Friday with a
seasonally adjusted Performance of Service Index score of 51.4.

That's up sharply from 36.2 in September and it moves above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, the index indicated growth in one sector, stability in two
sectors and contraction in two sectors. All activity indicators were
positive or stable in October, with the indices for sales, new orders
and supplier deliveries improving significantly from the previous month.
