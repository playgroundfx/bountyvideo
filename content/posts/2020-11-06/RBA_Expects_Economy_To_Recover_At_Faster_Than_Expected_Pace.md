The Reserve Bank of Australia said it expects the [economy][1] to
recover over coming quarters at a faster than previously estimate pace.

However, the economy is likely to be noticeably smaller at the end of
the forecast period than anticipated prior to the pandemic, partially
because of a sharp slowing in population growth, the bank said in the
Statement of Monetary Policy, released Friday.

Gross domestic product is forecast to grow 6 percent in the year ending
June 2021 compared to the previous projection of 4 percent. At the same
time, the outlook for the year ending June 2022 was retained at 4
percent.

The unemployment rate is expected to peak a little below 8 percent
around the end of the year. This peak represents a very high level of
spare capacity in the labor market, the bank noted.

The unemployment rate is expected to decline only gradually, to just
above 6 percent by the end of 2022.

Both headline and trimmed mean inflation are forecast to bottom out
below 1 percent in 2021, and reach 1.5 percent by end 2022.

According to RBA forecast, population growth will be 0.2 percent in
2020/21 and 0.4 percent in 2021/22. This was the slowest rate of
population growth since the First World War.
