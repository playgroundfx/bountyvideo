The consumer price index fell 1.5 percent year-on-year in October,
following a 1.1 percent decline in September. This was the highest since

"Plane tickets bought for October were 42 percent cheaper than last
year," Trasanov added.

Prices for transportation decreased 9.2 percent annually in October and
those of housing fell 3.5 percent.

Prices for clothing and footwear fell 0.8 percent. Prices for hotels,
cafes and restaurants, and communications decined 2.5 percent and 2.1
percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.5 percent in October,
following a 0.3 percent decline in the previous month.
