Finland's trade deficit increased in September as exports declined
faster than imports, preliminary figures from the Finnish Customs showed
on Friday.

The trade deficit widened to EUR 380 million in September from EUR 243
million in the same month last year. In August, the trade deficit was
EUR 230 million.

Exports declined 7.9 percent year-on-year in September and imports fell
5.1 percent.

Shipments to the EU countries decreased 4.0 percent in September and
imports from them fell 3.3 percent. Exports to countries outside the EU
decreased 12.5 percent and imports from those countries declined 17.7
percent.

For the January-September period, the trade deficit was EUR 2.8 billion
compared to a EUR 1.0 billion shortfall registered a year ago. Exports
declined 15.2 percent and imports decreased 11.4 percent.
