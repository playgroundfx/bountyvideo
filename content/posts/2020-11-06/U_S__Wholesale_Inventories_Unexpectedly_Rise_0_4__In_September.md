A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed an
unexpected increase in U.S. wholesale inventories in the month of
September.

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose by 0.4 percent
in September after climbing by 0.5 percent in August. Economists had
expected inventories to edge down by 0.1 percent.

The unexpected increase in wholesale inventories came as inventories of
non-durable goods advanced by 0.7 percent, while inventories of durable
goods inched up by 0.1 percent.

Meanwhile, the report said wholesale sales crept up by 0.1 percent in
September after jumping by 1.2 percent in August.

A 0.7 percent increase in sales of durable goods was partly offset by a
0.5 percent decrease in sales of non-durable goods.

The inventories/sales ratio for merchant wholesalers subsequently came
in at 1.31 in September, unchanged from the previous month.
