Employment in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the month of
October, according to a closely watched report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The report said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 638,000 jobs in
October after surging up by a revised 672,000 jobs in September.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 600,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 661,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate dropped to 6.9
percent in October from 7.9 percent in September. The unemployment rate
was expected to slip to 7.7 percent.
