Singapore's central bank left its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged on Wednesday
as the [economy][1] rebounded from a technical recession in the third
quarter.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore decided to maintain a zero percent
per annum rate of appreciation of the S$NEER [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) band. The width of
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) band and the level at which it is centered will be unchanged.

Signaling that the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain loose for an extended period, the
central bank said an accommodative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance will remain appropriate
for some time, as core inflation is set to stay long.

The MAS applies the exchange rate against a basket of currencies within
an undisclosed band as its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tool.

With GDP still well below its pre-crisis level, the MAS is likely to
maintain its accommodative stance for at least the next year, Alex
Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Prakash Sakpal, an ING economist said there is no room for complacency
on the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) front with the fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) continuing to do the heavy-
lifting to support the recovery going forward.

Although the economy is expected to see a recovery next year, the bank
said the underlying growth momentum will be weak and the negative output
gap will only narrow slowly in the year ahead.

Both MAS core inflation and overall consumer price inflation are
forecast to come in between -0.5 and 0 zercent in 2020. In 2021, core
inflation will average 0-1 percent, while headline inflation is
projected to be between -0.5 and 0.5 percent.

The city-state economy is forecast to contract by 5-7 percent this year,
and record above-trend growth for 2021 due to the effects of the low
base in 2020.

The advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry, released
Wednesday, showed that gross domestic product expanded 7.9 percent
sequentially in the third quarter, ending two consecutive quarters of
contraction.
