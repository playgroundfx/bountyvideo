Singapore's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 7.9
percent on quarter in the third quarter of 2020, the Ministry of Trade
and Industry said in Wednesday's advance estimate.

That was roughly in line with forecasts following the 13.2 percent
contraction in the three months prior.

On a yearly basis, GDP was down 7.0 percent - missing expectations for a
decline of 6.8 percent following the downwardly revised 13.3 percent
drop in the previous three months (originally -12.6 percent).

The manufacturing sector grew 2.0 percent on year in the third quarter,
a reversal from the 0.8 percent contraction in the previous quarter.
Growth of the sector was supported by output expansions in the
electronics and precision engineering clusters, which were in turn
driven by robust global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.

On a seasonally-adjusted quarterly basis, the manufacturing sector
expanded 3.9 percent, a turnaround from the 9.1 percent contraction in
Q2.

The construction sector shrank 44.7 percent on year in the third
quarter, extending the 59.9 percent decline in Q2. Construction output
in the third quarter remained weak on account of the slow resumption of
construction activities due to the need for construction firms to
implement safe management measures for a safe restart.

On a seasonally-adjusted quarterly basis, the construction sector spiked
38.7 percent, a rebound from the sharp contraction of 59.4 percent in
the second quarter when most construction activities had to come to a
stop due to the Circuit Breaker and movement restrictions in the foreign
worker dormitories.

The services producing industries contracted 8.0 percent on year in Q3,
an improvement from the 13.6 percent decline in the previous quarter.
Within services, aviation- and tourism-related sectors like air
transport and accommodation continued to see significant contractions,
as global travel restrictions and sluggish travel demand brought air
travel and visitor arrivals to a near complete standstill. Other trade-
related services sectors, such as wholesale trade, were also weighed
down by weak external demand as major economies around the world
continued to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.

On a seasonally-adjusted quarterly basis, the services producing
industries expanded 6.8 percent, a reversal from the 11.2 percent
decline seen in the second quarter.
