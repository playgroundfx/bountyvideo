Eurozone industrial production grew at a slower pace in August despite
the easing of [coronavirus][1] containment measures in many member
countries, data published by Eurostat revealed Wednesday.

Industrial production grew only 0.7 percent month-on-month, following
July's 5 percent increase. Output was forecast to climb 0.8 percent.

Among components, non-durable consumer goods and capital goods
production dropped 1.6 percent each.

Meanwhile, production of durable consumer goods advanced 6.8 percent and
that of intermediate goods gained 3.1 percent. Energy production rose
2.3 percent from the last month.

On a yearly basis, industrial output logged a decline of 7.2 percent
after falling 7.1 percent in July. The rate of decline came in line with
economists' expectations.  
  
In EU27, industrial output grew 1 percent on month in August but
declined 6.2 percent on a yearly basis.
