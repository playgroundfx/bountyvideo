Ireland's construction activity continued to expand in June following
loosening of the restrictions related to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic,
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank construction Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 65.0
in June, down from 66.4 in May. Nonetheless, a score above 50 indicates
expansion and the latest pace of growth was one of the strongest since
the survey began 21 years ago.

Among three categories, housing continued to lead the expansion, while
rates of growth in commercial and civil engineering activity accelerated
marginally.

"While the signals of ongoing strength in activity are certainly
encouraging, the rate of input cost inflation accelerated to a second
consecutive record high as the June survey results highlight that the
sector continues to face important supply-chain and cost challenges
related to Brexit, covid and global supply and shipping problems," Simon
Barry, chief economist Republic of Ireland at Ulster Bank, said.

New orders grew for the third straight month in June and firms raised
their staffing levels and purchasing activity.

On the price front, the survey showed that input price inflation hit a
record high in June largely due to Brexit and global supply issues.

Companies remained optimistic that activity will continue to rise over
the coming year amid expectations that demand will expand as the
[economy][2] reopens further.
