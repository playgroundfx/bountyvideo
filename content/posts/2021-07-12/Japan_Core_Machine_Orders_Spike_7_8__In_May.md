The value of core machine orders in Japan was up a seasonally adjusted
7.8 percent on month in May, the Cabinet Office said on Monday - coming
in at 865.7 billion yen.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 2.6 percent following the
0.6 percent increase in April.

On a yearly basis, core machine orders jumped 12.2 percent - again
beating forecasts for 6.3 percent after rising 6.5 percent in the
previous month.

The total value of machinery orders - including volatile ones for ships
and those from electric power companies - received by 280 manufacturers
operating in Japan jumped 9.8 percent on month in May.
