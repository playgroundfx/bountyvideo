The total value of core machine orders in Japan advanced a seasonally
adjusted 5.2 percent on month in December, the Cabinet Office said on
Wednesday - coming in at 899.6 billion yen.

That beat expectations for a decline of 6.2 percent following the 1.5
percent increase in November.

On a yearly basis, core machine orders jumped 11.8 percent - again
exceeding expectations for a fall of 3.0 percent after tumbling 11.3
percent in the previous month.

The total value of machinery orders received by 280 manufacturers
operating in Japan increased by 8.8 percent in December from the
previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.
