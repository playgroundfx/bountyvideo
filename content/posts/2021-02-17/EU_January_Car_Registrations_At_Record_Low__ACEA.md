European new car registrations hit a record low for January with a sharp
fall in sales mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic-related restrictions
across the region.  
  
New car registrations slumped 24.0 percent year-on-year following a 3.3
percent fall in December, figures from the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association/ACEA showed Wednesday.  
  
The number of units sold was 726,491, a record low for the month.  
  
The latest decline was the worst since a 52.3 percent fall in May, at
the peak of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.  
  
Many [markets][2] also had one [business][3] day less than in January
2020 and this negative [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) effect clearly also had an impact on
registrations, the Brussels-based industry group said.  
  
Almost all 27 EU markets suffered double-digit losses in January.  
  
Among the big four, Spain logged the worst fall of 51.5 percent,
followed by Germany with a 31.1 percent decline. Sales in Italy dropped
14.0 percent.  
  
France and Sweden were the only EU countries that did not post double-
digit drops in January.

France registered a modest decline of 5.8 percent. In Sweden,
registrations grew 22.5 percent in January.
