Following recent declines in U.S. retail sales, the Commerce Department
released a report on Wednesday showing retail sales rebounded by much
more than anticipated in the month of January.

The Commerce Department said retail sales spiked by 5.3 percent in
January after sliding by a revised 1.0 percent in December.

Economists had expected retail sales to jump by 1.1 percent compared to
the 0.7 percent decrease originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding sales by motor vehicle and parts retailers, retail sales
soared by 5.9 percent in January after tumbling by a revised 1.8 percent
in December.

Economists had expected ex-auto sales to increase by 1.0 percent
compared to the 1.4 percent slump originally reported for the previous
month.
