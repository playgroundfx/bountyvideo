Industrial production in the U.S. saw another notable increase in the
month of January, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve
on Wednesday.

The Fed said industrial production climbed by 0.9 percent in January
after jumping by a downwardly revised 1.3 percent in December.

Economists had expected industrial production to rise by 0.5 percent
compared to the 1.6 percent spike originally reported for the previous
month.

The bigger than expected increase in industrial production came as
manufacturing output surged up by 1.0 percent in January after climbing
by 0.9 percent in December.

Mining output also spiked by 2.3 percent in January after rising by 0.7
percent in December, while utilities output slumped by 1.2 percent after
soaring by 4.9 percent in the previous month.

"Industrial production is relatively protected from COVID-related risks
and will stay in expansion mode this year," said Oren Klachkin, Lead
U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Solid consumer goods demand, inventory restocking, rebounding
[business][1] investment, and additional pandemic relief from Congress
will keep industrial production from sliding into contraction."

The report also said capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose
to 75.6 percent in January from an upwardly revised 74.9 percent in
December.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to inch up to 74.8 percent
from the 74.5 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and mining sectors increased
to 74.6 percent and 82.2 percent, respectively, while capacity
utilization in the utilities sector fell to 73.5 percent.
