Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting did
not do much to change the view that the central bank is likely to leave
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged for the foreseeable future.

The minutes from the January meeting showed participants described the
[economy][1] as "far from" achieving the Fed's goal of maximum
employment.

Participants observed that "even with a brisk pace of improvement in the
labor market, achieving this goal would take some time."

The Fed said participants generally acknowledging that the medium-term
outlook for real GDP growth and employment had improved but continue to
see elevated uncertainty surrounding that outlook.

"Participants noted that economic conditions were currently far from the
Committee's longer-run goals and that the stance for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would need
to remain accommodative until those goals were achieved," the minutes
said.

They added, "Consequently, all participants supported maintaining the
Committee's current settings and outcome-based guidance for the federal
funds rate and the pace of asset purchases."

The minutes said various participants highlighted the importance of the
Fed clearly communicating its assessment of progress toward its longer-
run goals well in advance of when it could be judged substantial enough
to warrant a change in the pace of purchases.

"The minutes of the Fed's late January [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting show officials
still in dovish mood - willing to 'abstract from temporary factors
affecting inflation' and focused instead on achieving the FOMC's 'broad-
based and inclusive goal of maximum employment," said Paul Ashworth,
Chief US Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "We doubt that the Fed will begin to taper its asset purchases
until early next year and believe that the first rate hike will be
delayed until 2024."
