The jobless rate is tipped to ease to 6.5 percent from 6.6 percent in
December, with the addition of 40,000 jobs following the increase of
50,000 in the previous month. The participation rate is called steady at
66.2 percent.

The central bank in Indonesia will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting

to trim its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points, to 3.50 percent
from 3.75 percent.

Hong Kong will see unemployment data for January; in December, the
