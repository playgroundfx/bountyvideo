The Australian [economy][1] is gradually starting to pick up steam in
January, the latest survey from Westpac Bank and the Melbourne Institute
revealed on Monday with a leading index forecast of 4.48 percent - up
from 4.24 percent in December.

The growth rate of the Index continues to point to above trend growth in
the Australian economy through 2021.

In its February Statement on Monetary Policy the Reserve Bank forecast
growth of 3.5 percent for 2021, almost in line with the Westpac forecast
of 4 percent. With population growth forecast to slow to 0.2 percent in
2021 compared to 1.5 percent in 2019, both forecasts represent
significant above trend growth.

Westpac expects this growth to be led by the consumer with consumer
spending contributing around 3ppts to the overall 4 percent growth rate.
