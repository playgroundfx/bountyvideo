The value of non-oil domestic exports from Singapore climbed a
seasonally adjusted 7.0 percent on month in January, Enterprise
Singapore said on Wednesday - coming in at S$15.4 billion.

That beat expectations for an increase of 2.0 percent and was up from
4.8 percent in December, which had a value of S$14.4 billion.

On a yearly basis, non-oil domestic exports spiked 12.8 percent - far
exceeding expectations for a gain of 5.4 percent and up from the 6.8
percent jump in the previous month.

The increase was mainly due to electronics, specialized machinery, non-
monetary gold and petrochemicals, the bureau said.
