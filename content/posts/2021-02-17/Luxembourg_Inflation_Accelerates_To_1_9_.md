Luxembourg's headline inflation accelerated in January and prices rose
from the previous month, driven by higher prices for oil products.  
  
Consumer price inflation accelerated to 1.9 percent in January from 0.6
percent in the previous month, figures from the statistical office
showed Wednesday.  
  
The statistical office attributed the acceleration to the shift in the
sales period, which this year will only be included in the results for
February.  
Without this effect, inflation was 0.4 percent.  
  
Compared to the previous month, consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in
January.  
Separately, the statistical office forecast 1.7 percent inflation for
this year. Price growth would be supported by the recovery in oil prices
while underlying inflation would remain contained, the agency said.  
  
Inflation is expected to rise to 1.8 percent next year, led by the
economic recovery and the indexation of salaries.
