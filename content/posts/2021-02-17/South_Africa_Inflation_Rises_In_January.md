South Africa's consumer price inflation rise in January, figures from
Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 3.2 percent year-on-year in January,
following a 3.1 percent increase in December. This was in line with
economists' expectation. A similar higher rate of inflation was seen in
November.

The main contributions to the annual inflation came from food and non-
alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and
services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 5.4 percent
annually in January and housing and utilities cost rose by 2.6 percent.

Prices of miscellaneous goods and services grew 6.5 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer price grew 0.3 percent in January.
Economists had expectation a 0.4 percent rise.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.3 percent in January. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

On a monthly basis, the core CPI increased 0.1 percent in December.
Economists had forecast a rise of 0.2 percent.
