Largely reflecting a jump in retail inventories, the Commerce Department
released a report on Wednesday showing U.S. [business][1] inventories
increased by slightly more than expected in the month of December.

The Commerce Department said business inventories climbed by 0.6 percent
in December after rising by 0.5 percent in November. Economists had
expected another 0.5 percent increase.

Retail inventories jumped by 1.2 percent during the month, while
manufacturing and wholesale inventories both edged up by 0.3 percent.

The report also showed business sales increased by 0.8 percent in
December after coming in unchanged in the previous month.

Manufacturing sales spiked by 1.7 percent and wholesale sales surged up
by 1.2 percent, more than offsetting a 0.6 percent drop in retail sales.

With inventories and sales both climbing, the total business
inventories/sales ratio in December was unchanged from the previous
month at 1.32.
