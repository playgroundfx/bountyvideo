After reporting a substantial rebound in U.S. consumer sentiment in the
previous month, the University of Michigan released a report on Friday
showing sentiment has continued to improve in April but by much less
than anticipated.

The preliminary report showed the consumer sentiment index rose to 86.5
in April after soaring to 84.9 in March. Economists had expected the
index to jump to 89.6.

Despite the much smaller than expected increase, the consumer sentiment
index still reached its highest level since hitting 89.1 in March of
2020.

The modest increase by the headline index reflected an improvement in
assessments of current conditions, with the current economic conditions
index climbing to 97.2 in April from 93.0 in March.

Meanwhile, the report showed the index of consumer expectations for
April was unchanged from the previous month at 79.7.

Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin noted recoveries in
consumer sentiment are usually paced by larger and earlier gains in
expectations.

"The strength in current economic conditions reflects much larger than
usual stimulus payments during the past year, and much larger than usual
economic gains due to comparisons with last year's shutdowns," Curtin
said.

He added, "Other factors suppressed the pace of expected gains,
including persistent concerns with vaccine safety as well as a surge in
year-ahead inflation expectations to 3.7%, the highest level in nearly a
decade."

While the report showed one-year inflation expectations spiked to 3.7
percent in April from 3.1 percent in March, five-year inflation
expectations edged down to 2.7 percent from 2.8 percent.
