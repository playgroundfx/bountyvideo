Dutch producer confidence improved modestly in May, as the country eased
the lockdown restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, data from the Central Bureau of
Statistics showed on Thursday.

The producer confidence index rose to -25.1 in May from a record low
-28.7 in April.

The average reading for the past twenty years was 0.6. The confidence
index had peaked at 10.9 in February 2018, while the lowest reading of
-28.7 was seen in April 2020, the CBS said.

Despite the latest improvement, manufacturers remained negative about
their expected activity and the stocks of finished products decreased,
the CBS said.

In May, there were more producers who expected their production to
decrease in the coming three months than those who forecast a growth.

Electrical engineering and machine industry producer were less negative
in May and confidence in food, stimulants and transport industries
continued to decline.
