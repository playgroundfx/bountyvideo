Poland's central bank cut its key interest rate for a third [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
session in a row as the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic and the
lockdown imposed to slow its spread, have had a severe impact on the
[economy][2].  
  
The Monetary Policy Council decided to cut the key reference rate by 40
basis points to a fresh record low 0.10 percent, the National Bank of
Poland said in a statement on Thursday.  
  
In April, the bank had slashed the rate by 50 basis points, after a
similar reduction in an emergency meeting on March 17.

The lombard rate was lowered to 0.50 percent from 1 percent, while the
deposit rate was retained at zero. The rediscount rate was reduced to
0.11 percent from 0.55 percent.
