New Zealand [business][1] confidence improved in May, the final business
outlook survey data from the ANZ Bank showed Thursday.

The business confidence index rose to -41.8 in May from -66.6 in April.
The flash score was -45.6.

The full-month May survey showed small further lifts in most indicators
versus the preliminary results as the country continued to make good
progress on beating back Covid-19 and loosening restrictions on economic
activity.

However, the ANZ said the business outlook activity indicators are
improving painfully slowly. The levels of the indicators remained pretty
bleak, the survey showed.

Further, the ANZ said the recession is just starting to make itself
felt.
