Eurozone economic confidence improved in May after the record declines
of March and April, signaling early signs of recovery, survey data from
the European Commission showed Thursday.

The economic sentiment index rose to 67.5 in May from 64.9 in the
previous month. However, the reading was below economists' forecast of
70.3.

The indicator adds to the evidence that the euro-zone [economy][1]
bottomed out in April, but that activity is recovering only very slowly,
Melanie Debono, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The ESI's uptick reflected a recovery in industry and consumer
confidence which neutralized about a fifth of the combined slump of
March and April, the survey showed.

Meanwhile, services confidence continued declining, albeit at a lower
rate than in the preceding two months. Changes in construction and
retail trade confidence were much more contained, survey results showed.

The consumer sentiment index came in at -18.8 versus -22.0 in the
previous month. The reading matched the preliminary estimate.

Consumer sentiment recovered on the back of households' much improved
expectations regarding their financial conditions, their intentions to
make major purchases and the general economic situation.

The industrial confidence index advanced to -27.5 from -32.5 a month
ago. The recovery was entirely attributable to a vivid improvement in
managers' production expectations.

The confidence index in retail improved marginally to -29.7 from -30.1
in April.

Meanwhile, the services sentiment index declined to -43.6 from -38.6 in
April. While views on the past [business][2] situation and past demand
worsened, significantly improved demand expectations provided a glimmer
of hope for the months to come in May.

As the assessments of the level of order books continued plummeting, the
construction sentiment index fell to -17.4 from -16.1 a month ago.

The business confidence index declined to -2.43 from -1.99 in April,
data showed. This was the lowest since September 2009.
