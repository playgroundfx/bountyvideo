A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a continued
decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended May 23rd.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims dropped to 2.123
million, a decrease of 323,000 from the previous week's revised level of
2.446 million.

Economists had expected jobless claims to fall to 2.100 million from the
2.438 million originally reported for the previous week.

With the decrease, jobless claims pulled back further off the record
high of 6.867 million set in the week ended March 28th.

While jobless claims have steadily decreased over the past several
weeks, the number of claims since the [coronavirus][1]-induced lockdown
now exceeds 40 million.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also fell to 2.608 million, a decrease of 436,000 from the previous
week's revised average of 3.044 million.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, tumbled by 3.860 million to 21.052 million in
the week ended May 16th.

Meanwhile, the four-week moving average of continuing claims climbed to
22,722,250, an increase of  
760,250 from the previous week's revised average of 21,962,000.

The Labor Department is scheduled to release its closely watched report
on the employment situation in the month of May next Friday.
