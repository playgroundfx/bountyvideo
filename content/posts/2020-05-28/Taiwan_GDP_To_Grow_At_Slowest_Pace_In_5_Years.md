Taiwan's [economy][1] is forecast to grow at the slowest pace in five
years in 2020 as coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic has weighed on
consumption, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting & Statistics,
or DGBAS, said on Thursday.

Gross domestic product is forecast to grow 1.67 percent this year, much
slower than the 2.71 percent growth logged in 2019. The 2020 full year
outlook was downgraded from 2.37 percent.

In the first quarter, GDP advanced 1.59 percent compared to the previous
estimate of 1.54 percent. This was also slower than the 3.29 percent
growth seen in the preceding quarter.

On a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted annualized basis, GDP
contracted 3.57 percent compared to 6.56 percent expansion seen a
quarter ago.

On the demand side, real private final consumption fell 1.58 percent
annually in the first quarter, a reversal from the 2.95 percent growth
in the previous quarter.

Real gross capital formation expanded 5.70 percent led by the growth of
the investment in transportation equipments, constructions and
intellectual property products.

Meanwhile, exports and imports of goods and services dropped 2.37
percent and 3.95 percent, respectively.

The agency said Taiwan's export-related manufacturing activities are
less affected from the pandemic since there have been no curfew or
lockdown measures so far.  
However, due to weakened global demand, slumping oil price and reducing
tourists, exports of goods and services are forecast to shrink 0.70
percent this year.

Real private consumption is expected to contract 0.24 percent, while
private fixed capital formation is forecast to grow by 2.31 percent in
2020.

Consumer prices will decrease 0.32 percent this year, which was revised
downward by 0.94 percentage point, mainly reflecting the declining
prices of oil and raw material.
