German consumer price inflation eased to the lowest since 2016,
preliminary data from Destatis revealed Thursday.

Consumer price inflation slowed to 0.6 percent in May from 0.9 percent
in April. The rate came in line with expectations. A similar lower rate
was last reported in September 2016.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices dropped 0.1 percent in May, as
expected.

Data showed that cost of goods fell 0.4 percent annually, while cost of
services increased 1.3 percent in May.

Inflation, based on the harmonized index of services, slowed to 0.5
percent from 0.8 percent a month ago. The annual rate matched
expectations. This was the lowest rate since August 2016, when prices
climbed 0.3 percent.

Month-on-month, the harmonized index of consumer prices remained flat,
while economists had forecast a 0.1 percent fall.
