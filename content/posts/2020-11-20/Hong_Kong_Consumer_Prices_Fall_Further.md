Hong Kong's consumer prices declined for the fourth month in a row in
October, albeit at a softer pace, data from the Census and Statistics
Department showed on Friday.

The composite consumer price index fell 0.2 percent year-on-year in
October, following a 2.2 percent decline in September.

The pace of annual decline slowed mainly due to the effect of the waiver
of public housing rents by the Hong Kong Housing Authority in September,
dissipated in October.

Excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, the
composite consumer price index rose 0.4 percent annually in October,
following a 0.5 percent rise in the previous month.  
  
The year-on-year increase in prices of meals bought away from home
accelerated slightly as the local epidemic situation remained stable, a
government spokesman said.

"Looking ahead, overall inflationary pressures should stay tame in the
near term as the evolving COVID-19 pandemic still weighs on the global
and local economic conditions," the spokesman said.
