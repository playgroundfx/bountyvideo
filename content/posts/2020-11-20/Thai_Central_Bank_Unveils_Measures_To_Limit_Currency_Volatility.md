Thailand's central bank on Friday unveiled measures to mitigate
pressures on the Thai baht and to address structural issues in the
foreign exchange market.

The outcome of the US presidential election and the progress on the
Covid-19 vaccine development lifted confidence and prompted renewed
inflow of funds into the emerging market economies.

The rapid appreciation of the currency is likely to affect the fragile
economic recovery of Thailand, Vachira Arromdee, assistant governor for
financial [markets][1] operations group, said.

To address the risk associated with currency volatility, the Bank of
Thailand permitted residents to freely deposit funds in Foreign Currency
Deposit accounts and allow free fund transfers between them. This would
help exporters to effectively manage liquidity and [forex][2] risk.

Further, the bank relaxed [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s regarding investment in foreign
securities, including lifting investment thresholds and expanding
eligible financial products for portfolio diversification.

Further, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were required to complete a registration process
before investing in debt securities, which will upgrade the bond
surveillance system. This will help to enable the implementation of
targeted measures in a timely manner, the bank said.
