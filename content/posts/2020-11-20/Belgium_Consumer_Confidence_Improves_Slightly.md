Belgium's consumer confidence improved slightly in November after
weakening in the previous month as initial impact of the tighter
lockdown measures waned, survey data from the National Bank of Belgium
showed on Friday.  
  
The consumer confidence index fell to -15 from -17 in October.  
  
All components of the indicator have improved, even if only modestly,
with the exception of prospects regarding consumers' financial
situation, which have remained stable.  
  
Households' perception of the general economic outlook turned more
optimistic in November and the indicator climbed to -17, its pre-
pandemic level.  
  
Consumers continued to be less fearful of rising unemployment over the
next twelve months, but the level of worry remained high. The
corresponding indicator eased slightly to 58 from 59.  
  
Their view on the personal finances outlook remained unchanged and the
indicator was steady at 1. A higher proportion were inclined to save
more and the indicator rose to 13 from 10.

The [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly high level of the indicator suggest a persistence of
the effects of the [health][1] crisis, the survey said.
