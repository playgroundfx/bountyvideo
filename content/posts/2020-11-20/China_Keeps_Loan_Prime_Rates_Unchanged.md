China kept its benchmark loan prime rates unchanged for the seventh
consecutive month, as widely expected, on Friday.

The one-year loan prime rate was retained at 3.85 percent and the five-
year loan prime rate was maintained at 4.65 percent.

The one-year and five-year loan prime rates were last reduced in April.
The one-year loan prime rate was lowered by 20 basis points and five-
year rate by 10 basis points in April.

The loan prime rate is fixed monthly based on the submission of 18
banks, though Beijing has influence over the rate-setting. This new
lending rate replaced the central bank's traditional benchmark lending
rate in August 2019.

As the PBoC had not adjusted the rate on its medium-term lending
facility early this month, commercial banks were widely expected to
retain the LPR today.

Given that the [economy][1] is now back on track and fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
set to remain supportive until at least the start of next year, the PBoC
is shifting its focus away from supporting growth back towards
addressing financial risks and moral hazard, Julian Evans-Pritchard and
Sheana Yue, economists at Capital Economics, said.

And while the PBoC will probably want to start increasing the LPR at
some point, recent comments by the vice governor suggest that it is no
rush to do so, economists noted.

The economists expect PBoC [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates to rise by 30 basis points in
2021.
