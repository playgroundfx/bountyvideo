The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in November, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on Friday
with a manufacturing PMI score of 48.3.

That's down from 48.7 in October and was shy of expectations for 49.4.
It also moved further beneath the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates
expansion from contraction; the index has been in contraction for 19
straight months.

Production and new orders fell at faster rates, while employment fell
marginally further and [business][1] expectations slipped to a three-
month low.

The survey also said the services PMI fell to 46.7 from 47.7 a month
earlier, and the composite PMI sank to 47.0 from 48.0 in the previous
month.
