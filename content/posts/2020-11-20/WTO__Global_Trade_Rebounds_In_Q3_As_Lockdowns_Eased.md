The World Trade Organization said the global merchandise trade rebounded
strongly in the third quarter after plunging amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Goods Trade Barometer, a real-time gauge of trends in global trade,
rose to 100.7 in the third quarter from 84.5 registered last August.

The index reading greater than 100 suggests above-trend growth, while
those below 100 indicate below-trend growth.

The indicator signaled a strong rebound in trade in the third quarter as
lockdowns were eased, but growth is likely to slow in the fourth quarter
as pent-up demand is exhausted and inventory restocking is completed.

The WTO observed that renewed lockdowns in Europe and North America
could lead to another round of [business][1] closures and financial
distress.

According to WTO forecast, world merchandise trade volume will fall 9.2
percent this year. This outcome would require a sharp rebound in the
third quarter, following the 17.2 percent annual decline registered in
the second quarter.
