Eurozone's consumer confidence weakened for a second consecutive month
in November to reach its lowest level in six months as countries like
Germany and France returned to lockdown amid a resurgence in the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The flash consumer confidence index fell to -17.6 from -15.5 in October,
preliminary data from the European Commission showed on Friday.
Economists had forecast a score of -17.7.  
  
The latest reading was the weakest since May, when it was -18.8.  
  
The corresponding indicator for the EU also dropped to a six-month low
of -18.7 from -16.5 in October.  
  
The survey was conducted from November 1 to 19.  
  
The final readings are set to be published along with the monthly
economic sentiment survey results on November 27.
