The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to expand in September, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit showed on Monday
with a PMI score of 55.2.

That's up from 52.2 in August, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output rose at a sharper pace and there was a substantial
increase in new work. Employment expanded at the quickest rate in nearly
two and a half years.

The steeper increase in new [business][1] added further pressure to
operating capacities, as highlighted by a sustained upturn in backlogs
of work. Moreover, the rate of accumulation was the sharpest for over
two years.
