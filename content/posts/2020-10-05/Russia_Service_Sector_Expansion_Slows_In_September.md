Russia's service sector expanded at a softer pace in September, survey
data from IHS Markit showed on Monday

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.7 in September from
58.2 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

The quarterly PMI reading was the highest since the opening of three
moths of 2017.

New [business][1] growth was solid in September, but the rate of
increase eased to the lowest in three months. New export orders weighed
on total sales with demand from abroad falling for the seventh straight
month.

The number of staff were reduced in September and the backlogs of work
declined at a faster pace.

Cost burden rose sharply in September, with the rate of inflation
quickest for six months and input cost increased. Selling prices rose at
the fastest rate since March.

Business confidence moderated in September and firms remained optimistic
of an increase in business activity over the coming year, but the degree
of positive sentiment was muted.

The composite output index decreased to 53.7 in September from 57.3 in
the preceding month.

"Panelist reports of currency volatility and cost pressures from
supplier price hikes mean we are not likely to see a further interest
rate cut by the Central Bank of Russia in the coming months," Sian
Jones, economist at IHS Markit, said.

"Our latest forecast expects the base rate to remain at 4.25 percent for
the rest of 2020," Jones said.
