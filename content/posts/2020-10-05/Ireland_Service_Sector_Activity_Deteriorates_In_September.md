Ireland's service sector contracted in September amid rising virus cases
and economic uncertainty, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The AIB Ireland services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 45.8 in
September from 52.4 in August. Any score below 50 indicates contraction
in the sector.

Over the third quarter, the index rose to 50.0 compared to 25.7 in the
second quarter.

Transport, tourism and leisure declined at a faster rate in September.
Financial intermediation dropped for the sixth time in seven months,
while [business][1] services and the technology, media and telecoms
sectors fell marginally.

Total activity declined with the fall in incoming new business in
September. Export demand weakened due to Covid-19 uncertainty and Brexit
and the rate of decline in new exports was the fastest on three months.

Backlogs of work declined for the seventh month in a row in September
and the rate of depletion was the weakest in the current sequence. The
rate of job shedding fell slightly from August.

Input prices rose for the third straight month in September and prices
charged increased for the first time in seven months.

The 12-month outlook remained positive in September, though it eased
from its recent high in June.

Private sector output, covering manufacturing and services, decreased in
September. The composite output index fell to 46.9 in September from
54.0 in the previous month.

"The recent marked rise in new cases of Covid-19 in Europe and resulting
re-imposition of restrictions on activity is being most clearly felt in
services sectors that depend on discretionary consumer spending," Oliver
Mangan, AIB chief economist, said.
