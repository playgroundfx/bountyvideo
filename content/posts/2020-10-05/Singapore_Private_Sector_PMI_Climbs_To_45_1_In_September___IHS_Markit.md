The private sector [economy][1] in Singapore continued to contract in
September, albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit
showed on Monday with a PMI score of 45.1.

That's up from 43.6 in August, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output declined at a slower rate, while last month saw the
slowest job shedding since February. Business sentiment turned positive.

Demand conditions continued to be hampered by social distancing measures
designed to control the spread of COVID-19. New [business][2] inflows
fell again in September, with the rate of decline broadly similar to
that seen in August.
