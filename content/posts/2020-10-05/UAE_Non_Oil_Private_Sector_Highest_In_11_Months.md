The UAE non-oil private sector recovered in September amid a rise in new
orders, and reached its best level in nearly a year, survey data from
IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.0 in September from 49.4 in
August. This was the highest reading for eleven months.

Any reading above 50.0 marks expansion in the sector.

Output increased further in September and new [business][1] increased
with rising activity level. Export sales rose for the second time in
eight months.

Cost burden increased for the fifth month in a row in September, albeit
slightly.

New orders inflow led to a slower fall in private sector employment in
September. Firms reduced their spending on purchases for the first time
in the recent period of output growth.

The 12-month outlook weakend and the business sentiment was at its
second-lowest level.

"More concerning is a recent rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases that could
lead to lockdown restrictions being reimposed in the future," David
Owen, Economist at IHS Markit, said.

"Given the weak nature of the current rebound, any further measures
could lead to a "double-dip" in business activity," Owen added.
