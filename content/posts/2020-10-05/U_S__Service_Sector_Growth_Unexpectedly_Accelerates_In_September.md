Activity in the U.S. service sector unexpectedly grew at a faster rate
in the month of September, according to a report released by the
Institute for Supply Management on Monday.

The ISM said its services PMI rose inched up 57.8 in September from 56.9
in August, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the service
sector. Economists had expected the index to edge down to 56.3.

"The composite index indicated growth for the fourth consecutive month
after contraction in April and May," said Anthony Nieves, Chair of the
ISM Services Business Survey Committee.

He added, "Respondents' comments remain mostly optimistic about
[business][1] conditions and the economy, which correlates directly to
those businesses that are operating."

The unexpected uptick by the headline was partly due to an acceleration
in the pace of growth in new orders, as the new orders index jumped to
61.5 in September from 56.8 in August.

The report also showed a turnaround in employment in the service sector,
with the employment index climbing to 51.8 in September from 47.9 in
August.

Meanwhile, the report showed a slowdown in the pace of price growth in
the sector, as the prices index slumped to 59.0 in September from 64.2
in August.

The ISM released a separate report last Thursday showing the
manufacturing activity in the U.S. expanded for the fourth straight
month in September, although the pace of growth unexpectedly slowed
modestly.

The ISM said its purchasing managers index edged down to 55.4 in
September after rising to 56.0 in August. While a reading above 50 still
indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, economists had expected
the index to inch up to 56.3.
