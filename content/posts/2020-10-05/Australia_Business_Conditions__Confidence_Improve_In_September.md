Australia's [business][1] conditions and confidence improved in
September, survey data from the National Australia Bank showed Monday.

The business confidence index rose to -4 from -8 in the previous month.
Confidence rose in all industries except finance, business & property
services which was flat.

At the same time, the conditions index advanced to zero from -6 a month
ago.  
Conditions returned to the levels seen in early 2020 though it remained
well below average.

The improvement in conditions was driven by a rise in all three sub-
components. Trading and profits logged positive figures and the
employment index advanced eight points but remained in negative zone.

"While the improvement in conditions and confidence in the last few
months has been promising, it is important to remember that in a levels
sense, things are still weak," Alan Oster, NAB group chief economist,
said.

"With forward orders still negative it is unlikely that capacity
utilisation will be fully recovered in the near term," Oster added.
