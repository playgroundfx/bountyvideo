Business optimism improved among UK [business][1] and professional
services in the three months to February, while morale weakened in
consumer services, the latest quarterly Service Sector Survey from the
Confederation of British Industry showed on Thursday.

Sentiment among business and professional services improved at the
strongest pace since August 2015. The balance advanced to +23 percent
from -21 percent.

At the same time, sentiment about the general business situation
continued to worsen in consumer services, and at a slightly faster pace
than in the three months to November, to -39 percent from -34 percent.

Profitability as well as employment in business and professional
services and consumer services continued to decline in three months to
February.

"Although, the pace of decline has eased, particularly compared with the
first lockdown last year, the next few months promise mixed fortunes for
the sector," Ben Jones, CBI principal economist, said.

"Consumer service activity, in particular, is expected to remain in the
doldrums, though business and professional services firms are a bit more
hopeful, with profitability projected to stabilise and employment set to
grow," Jones added.
