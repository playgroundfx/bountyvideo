German consumer confidence is set to improve in March, survey results
from the market research group GfK showed on Thursday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index rose more-than-expected to
-12.9 in March from revised -15.5 in the previous month. The expected
level was -14.3.

"Consumers are recovering somewhat from the shock that hit them after
the hard lockdown in mid-December," Rolf Bürkl, GfK consumer expert,
said.

"The recent drop in the number of infections and the vaccination
campaigns that have started are fueling hopes that the measures will be
relaxed soon," Bürkl added.

Economic and income expectations and the propensity to buy showed
increases in February after the lockdown-induced slump at the beginning
of the year. Moreover, a fall in propensity to save also contributed to
the improvement in consumer confidence.

The economic expectations came in at 8.0, up from 1.3 in January. After
four consecutive declines, the income expectations index rose to 6.5 in
February from -2.9 in the previous month.

At the same time, the propensity to buy climbed to 7.4 from 0 a month
ago, the survey showed.
