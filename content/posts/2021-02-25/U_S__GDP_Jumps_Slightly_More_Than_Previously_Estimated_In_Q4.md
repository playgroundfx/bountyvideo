Revised data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed U.S.
gross domestic product jumped by slightly more than originally estimated
in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The Commerce Department said GDP surged up by 4.1 percent in the fourth
quarter compared to the previously reported 4.0 percent spike. The
upward revision matched economist estimates.

The slightly stronger than previously estimated GDP growth came as
upward revisions to residential fixed investment, private inventory
investment, and state and local government spending were partly offset
by a downward revision to consumer spending.
