Portugal's consumer confidence deteriorated in February after
strengthening in the previous two months, preliminary data from
Statistics Portugal showed Thursday.

The consumer confidence index fell to -25.8 from -23.1 in January. The
weakening was mainly due to the negative contribution of the
perspectives regarding the outlook for the country's economic situation.

Expectations on the outlook for spending on major purchases also
contributed negatively.

The economic sentiment index dropped to -1.8 from -0.9 in the previous
month. The manufacturing confidence measure improved to -13.9 from
-15.1.
