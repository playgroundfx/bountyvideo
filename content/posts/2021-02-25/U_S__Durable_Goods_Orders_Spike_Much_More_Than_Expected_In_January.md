New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods spiked by much more than
expected in the month of January, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department on Thursday.

The report said durable goods orders soared by 3.4 percent in January
after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.2 percent in December.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to surge up by 1.1 percent
compared to the 0.5 percent increase that had been reported for the
previous month.

Excluding a sharp increase in orders for transportation equipment,
durable goods orders still jumped by 1.4 percent in January after
spiking by an upwardly revised 1.7 percent in December.

Ex-transportation orders had been expected to climb by 0.7 percent,
matching the increase that had been reported for the previous month.
