South Africa's producer price inflation rose to the highest level in
eleven months in January, figures from Statistics South Africa showed on
Thursday.

The producer price index rose 3.5 percent year-on-year in January,
following a 3.0 percent increase in December and November. Economists
had expected inflation to rise to 3.1 percent.

The latest producer price inflation was the highest since February last
year, when prices rose 4.5 percent.

The main contribution for the increase in prices came from food
products, beverages and tobacco products, metals, machinery, equipment
and computing equipment, and transport equipment in January.

Producer prices for mining industry gained 22.9 percent annually in
January and prices for electricity and water increased 8.7 percent.

Prices for agriculture, forestry and fishing, and intermediate goods
rose by 11.3 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.8 percent in January.
Economists had expected a 0.4 percent rise.
