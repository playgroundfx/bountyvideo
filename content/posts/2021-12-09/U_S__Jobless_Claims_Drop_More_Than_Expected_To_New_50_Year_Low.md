First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits pulled back by much
more than expected in the week ended December 4, according to a report
released by the Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims slid to 184,000, a decrease of
43,000 from the previous week's revised level of 227,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 215,000 from the
222,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims dropped to their
lowest level since hitting 182,000 in September of 1969.

The less volatile four-week moving average also fell to 218,750, a
decrease of 21,250 from the previous week's revised average of 240,000,
hitting its lowest level since hitting 215,250 in March of 2020.

Meanwhile, the report said continuing claims, a reading on the number of
people receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, rose by 38,000 to
1.992 million in the week ended November 27th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims still declined to a
new pandemic-era low 2,027,500, a decrease of 54,250 from the previous
week's revised average of 2,081,750.

"Seasonal adjustment factors continue to wreak havoc with the data, and
the claims figures may remain volatile through the holiday season," said
Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Looking past the noise, we think claims will eventually
hover more consistently around pre-pandemic levels of 220k, assuming the
Omicron variant of the [coronavirus][1] has only a moderate negative
impact on the [economy][2]."

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
employment in the U.S. increased by much less than expected in the month
of November.

The report said non-farm payroll employment rose by 210,000 jobs in
November after surging by an upwardly revised 546,000 jobs in October.

Economists had expected employment to spike by 550,000 jobs compared to
the jump of 531,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

Despite the much weaker than expected job growth, the unemployment rate
slid to 4.2 percent in November from 4.6 percent in October. Economists
had expected the unemployment rate to edge down to 4.5 percent.

With the much bigger than expected decrease, the unemployment rate fell
to its lowest level since hitting 3.5 percent in February of 2020.
