UK recruiters reported a robust expansion in hiring activity in
November, with both permanent placement and temp billing rising
strongly, the latest KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs survey showed on
Thursday.

Permanent placements rose at a sharper rate than in October, the fifth-
quickest on record. Permanent job growth continued to outpace that seen
for temp billings.

Although demand for staff continued to increase in November, the vacancy
growth slipped to a six-month slow.

The downturn in candidate availability eased to its weakest since May.
Nonetheless, the rate of decline remained substantial and among the
quickest since data collection began in late 1997.

Further, low candidate numbers and efforts to attract and secure workers
drove further steep increases in pay for both permanent joiners and
temporary staff.

"It's too early to tell what the effect of the Omicron variant might be
on the labour market - December may be slower than previous months as
its effects feed through," Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC,
said.
