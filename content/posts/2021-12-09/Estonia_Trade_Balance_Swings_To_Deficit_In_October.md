versus a surplus of 27 million in the same month last year. In
September, the trade deficit was EUR 70 million.

Exports grew 18.0 percent year-on-year in October, after a 30.0 percent
rise in September.

Imports rose 32.0 percent yearly in October, after a 37.0 percent growth
in the previous month.

"In October, the imports of goods reached yet another record level,"
Evelin Puura, a leading analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.
