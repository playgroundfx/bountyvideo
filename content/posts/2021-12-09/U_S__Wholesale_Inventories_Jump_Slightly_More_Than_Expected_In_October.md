The Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing a sharp
increase in U.S. wholesale inventories in the month of October.

The report said wholesale inventories surged up by 2.3 percent in
October after jumping by 1.4 percent in September. Economists had
expected inventories to shoot up by 2.1 percent.

The bigger than expected increased came as inventories of durable goods
spiked by 2.1 percent, while inventories of non-durable goods soared by
2.6 percent.

The Commerce Department said wholesales also shot up by 2.2 percent in
October after surging by 1.7 percent in September.

Sales of non-durable goods skyrocketed by 3.0 percent, while sales of
durable goods jumped by 1.4 percent.

With inventories and sales both showing strong growth, the
inventories/sales ratio for merchant wholesalers was unchanged from the
previous month at 1.22.
