China's bank lending increased less than expected in November, data from
the People's Bank of China revealed on Thursday.

Banks extended CNY 1.27 trillion in new loans in November but less than
the expected lending of CNY 1.6 trillion. Lending had increased CNY
826.2 billion in October.

Total social financing, a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the
[economy][1], increased to CNY 2.61 trillion from CNY 1.59 trillion in
October.

Broad M2 money supply grew 8.5 percent year-on-year in November,
following an 8.7 percent rise in October.

Credit growth could edge up further in the coming months given
intensifying efforts to push down borrowing costs and support the
housing market, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

That said, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers still appear to be trying to balance their
desire to soften the economic downturn with their concerns over high
debt levels, the economist added.
