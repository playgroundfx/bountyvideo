UK house prices are expected to increase next year at the national
level, the residential market survey from the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, or RICS, showed on Thursday.

A net 66 percent of contributors said prices to increase over the next
year.

A net balance of 71 percent participants reported an increase in prices
in November as a lack of stock is driving competition between
prospective buyers. The net balance was identical to October's survey.

The net balance for new buyer enquiries rose to 13 percent from 11
percent in October. Meanwhile, there was a net balance fall of -9
percent in agreed sales, the fifth time in a row a negative result has
been reported.

Further, a net 18 percent registered a fall in new listing, which was
the eighth consecutive decrease.

Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said "The imbalance compared to
the demand trend is, meanwhile, likely to continue to be a key factor
supporting prices and indeed, even if the cost of mortgage finance does
begin to edge up, it is likely that house prices will continue to move
higher through the coming year, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than
over the past twelve months."
