UK consumer price inflation rose to a four-month high in July on
clothing and petrol prices, data from the Office for National Statistics
showed Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 1 percent in July, while the rate was
forecast to remain unchanged at 0.6 percent.  
  
On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained unexpectedly by 0.4 percent,
faster than the 0.1 percent rise in June. Prices were forecast to drop
0.1 percent.

Clothing, rising prices at the petrol pump, and furniture and household
goods made large upward contributions.

Core inflation that excludes costs of energy, food, alcoholic beverages
and tobacco, accelerated to 1.8 percent from 1.4 percent in June.

Another report from ONS showed that output prices fell 0.9 percent
annually in July, the same rate of decline as seen in June and in line
with economists' expectations.

Month-on-month, output prices gained again by 0.3 percent as expected in
July.

At the same time, the annual fall in input prices slowed to 5.7 percent
from 6.7 percent in June. Prices were expected to drop 6.1 percent.

On a monthly basis, input prices advanced 1.8 percent, slower than the 3
percent rise in June but faster than economists' forecast of 1.1
percent.
