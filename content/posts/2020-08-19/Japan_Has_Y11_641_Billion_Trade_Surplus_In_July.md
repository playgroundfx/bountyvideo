Japan posted a merchandise trade surplus of 11.641 billion yen in July,
the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday.

That blew away expectations for a deficit of 77.6 billion yen following
the 268.8 billion yen shortfall in June.

Exports slumped 19.2 percent on year, beating forecasts for a decline of
21.0 percent following the 26.2 percent drop in the previous month.

Imports were down an annual 22.3 percent versus expectations for a
decline of 22.8 percent following the 14.4 percent slide a month
earlier.
