Australia's leading index remained in deep negative territory in July
but the index appeared to have bottomed out in April, Westpac said
Wednesday.

The six-month annualized growth rate in the Westpac Melbourne Institute
Leading Index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity
relative to trend three to nine months into the future, rose to -4.37
percent in July from -4.43 percent in June.

The economic contraction in Victoria caused by the hard lockdown
following the renewed virus outbreak will offset the ongoing recovery in
other states, said Westpac.

Wespac expects economic growth to be flat in the September quarter
before lifting by 2.8 percent in the December quarter on the assumption
that Victoria moves through Stage 4 to Stage 2 and the other states
avoid 'second wave' outbreaks.

Looking over the six months since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic,
the index still showed a large, broad-based weakening.
