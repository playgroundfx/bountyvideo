During his much anticipated speech at the Federal Reserve's annual
Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell
said the central bank is likely to begin tapering some of its easy-money
policies before the end of the year.

However, he added that he still feels there's "much ground to cover"
before rate hikes.

Powell said the [economy][1] has reached a point where it no longer
needs as much [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support, indicating the Fed might start reducing
the amount of bonds it purchases each month before the end of 2021,
provided the economy continues to progress.

"The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not
be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest
rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and
substantially more stringent test," Powell said in prepared remarks for
the virtual summit.

He added that while inflation is solidly around the Fed's 2% target
rate, "we have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment," which
is the second prong of the central bank's dual mandate and necessary
before rate hikes happen.

The Fed chair also explained why he continues to think the rise in
inflation is transitory and will drop eventually to the target level. He
said that "test has been met" for inflation while there "has also been
clear progress toward maximum employment."

He added that some of the factors that pushed inflation higher are
starting to abate. "Inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for
concern. But that concern is tempered by a number of factors that
suggest that these elevated readings are likely to prove temporary," he
said.

Powell added that he and other [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers in the Fed agreed at the
July Federal Open Market Committee meeting that "it could be appropriate
to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year."

On the employment front, Powell noted that the delta variant of Covid
"presents a near-term risk" to getting back to full employment. However,
he said "the prospects are good for continued progress toward maximum
employment."
