Sweden's [economy][1] grew at a faster pace in the second quarter,
underpinned by investments and household consumption, preliminary data
from Statistics Sweden showed Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent from the
first quarter, when the economy expanded 0.8 percent.  
  
In the second quarter of 2020, the economy shrank 8.1 percent.

Compared to the same quarter of last year, GDP rose 9.7 percent in the
second quarter after a 0.2 percent fall in the previous three months.
The increase was the first since the March quarter of 2020.

Household consumption rose 1.0 percent from the previous quarter, driven
by growth in foreign consumption and recreation and culture. State
spending grew 0.8 percent.  
  
Change in inventories added 0.1 percentage point to GDP growth.  
  
Gross fixed capital formation grew 3.8 percent, led by machinery and
investment that added 1.4 percentage points.  
  
Exports decreased 1.1 percent, while imports rose 0.7 percent. The
downward contribution from net exports to GDP growth was 0.8 percentage
points.

The number of employed grew by 0.4 percent.  
  
The latest GDP data confirmed that the economy surpassed its pre-virus
peak in the second quarter, and output is set to make further gains in
the third quarter, Capital Economics said.  
  
"On the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) front, while we think interest rate hikes are still years
away, we would not be surprised if strong house price gains prompted
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers to start shrinking the balance sheet before the end of next
year - sooner than they have hinted so far and ahead of other advanced-
economy central banks," David Oxley, economist at Capital Economics,
said.
