A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a steep
drop in U.S. labor productivity in the fourth quarter and a sharp
increase in unit labor costs.

The Labor Department said labor productivity plunged by 4.8 percent in
the fourth quarter after spiking by an upwardly revised 5.1 percent in
the third quarter.

Economists had expected productivity to tumble by 2.8 percent compared
to the 4.6 percent jump that had been reported for the previous quarter.

The substantial decrease in productivity, a measure of output per hour,
came as hours worked soared by 10.7 percent compared to a 5.3 percent
surge in output.

"Looking ahead, productivity growth should pick up later this year as
the economic recovery gets a boost from the rollout of vaccines and
sizeable fiscal stimulus," said Lydia Boussour, Lead U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

She added, "However, we expect the gains to gradually revert back to a
more subdued trend in the medium run."

The report also showed unit labor costs skyrocketed by 6.8 percent in
the fourth quarter after plummeting by a revised 7.7 percent in the
third quarter.

Unit labor costs were expected to surge up by 3.9 percent compared to
the 6.6 percent nosedive that had been reported for the previous
quarter.

The spike in labor costs reflected the steep drop in productivity
combined with a 1.7 percent increase in hourly compensation.
