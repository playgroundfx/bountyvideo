Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers unanimously decided to retain the record
low UK interest rate and quantitative easing amid a third lockdown to
curb the [coronavirus][1].

The nine-member monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee headed by Governor Andrew
Bailey voted to hold the interest rate at 0.10 percent and the
quantitative easing at GBP 895 billion.

On negative interest rate, the MPC said it did not wish to send any
signal that it intended to set a negative Bank Rate at some point in the
future. It concluded overall that it would be appropriate to start the
preparations to provide the capability to do so if necessary in the
future.

The [economy][2] is expected to fall by around 4 percent in the first
quarter of 2021, in contrast to expectations of a rise in the November
Report.

According to latest Monetary Policy Report, GDP is projected to recover
rapidly towards pre-Covid levels over 2021, as the vaccination programme
is assumed to lead to an easing of Covid-related restrictions and
people's [health][3] concern.  
  
Consumer price inflation is forecast to rise quite sharply towards the 2
percent target in the spring, as the reduction in VAT for certain
services comes to an end and given developments in energy prices.

Inflation is projected to be close to 2 percent over the second and
third years of the forecast period.
