Australia had a seasonally adjusted merchandise trade surplus of A$6.785
billion in December, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Thursday.

That exceeded expectations for a A$6.0 billion surplus following the
downwardly revised A$5.014 billion surplus in November (originally
A$5.022 billion).

Exports were up 3.0 percent on month to A$37.268 billion, in line with
forecasts following the downwardly revised 2.8 percent increase in the
previous month (originally 3.0 percent).

Imports slipped 2.0 percent on month to A$30.483 billion versus
expectations for a loss of 4.0 percent following the downwardly revised
9.3 percent increase a month earlier (originally 10.0 percent).
