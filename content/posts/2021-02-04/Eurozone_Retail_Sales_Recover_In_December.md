Eurozone retail sales grew in December after a sharp fall in November,
data from Eurostat revealed on Thursday.

Retail sales increased 2 percent month-on-month in December, in contrast
to a fall of 5.7 percent in November. Sales were forecast to grow 1.6
percent.

Sales of food, drinks and tobacco gained 1.9 percent and non-food
product sales climbed 1.5 percent. Sales of automotive fuel in
specialized stores advanced 5.1 percent.

On a yearly basis, sales volume grew 0.6 percent, reversing a 2.2
percent drop in November. Economists had forecast a 0.3 percent rise.

The small bounce back in December was because of new countries imposing
restrictive measures while others loosened up for the holiday period,
Bert Colijn, an ING economist, said. The modest rebound suggests that
current lockdowns do significantly impair consumption despite online
sales.

In the EU27, retail sales grew 1.4 percent on month and by 0.5 percent
annually in December.
