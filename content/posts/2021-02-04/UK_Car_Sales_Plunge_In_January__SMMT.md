UK car sales declined sharply in January as showrooms across the country
remained shut, leading to the worst start to the year since 1970, the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said Thursday.

Car sales fell 39.5 percent year-on-year to 90,249 units in January.  
  
With lockdown restrictions in place until March, the most important
month of the year, which accounts for one in five new car registrations
on average, the industry will face a challenging year as showroom
closures depressed consumer demand.

Citing the current lockdown, the lobby downgraded its market outlook for
2021 to 1.9 million. The forecast does represent an increase of 15.7
percent compared to 2020's 'lost year' but it would still be a very
subdued market in [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

"Following a GBP 20.4 billion loss of revenue last year, the auto
industry faces a difficult start to 2021," Mike Hawes, SMMT chief
executive, said. "Lifting the shutters will secure jobs, stimulate the
essential demand that supports our manufacturing, and will enable us to
forge ahead on the Road to Zero."

Further, the latest SMMT analysis showed that 2020 recorded the largest
ever fall in average car CO2 emissions, spurred on by increased uptake
of battery electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid vehicles and hybrid electric
vehicles.
