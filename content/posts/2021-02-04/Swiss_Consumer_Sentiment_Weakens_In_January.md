Swiss consumer sentiment deteriorated slightly in January, survey data
from the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, showed on
Thursday.

The consumer sentiment index fell to -14.6 in January from -13.0 in the
preceding quarter. The indicator remained below its long-term average of
-5.0.

Expectations regarding general economic development were more
pessimistic than in October's survey with the index easing to -18.6 from
-14.3.

While the index on the financial situation in the last twelve months has
increased somewhat to -12.4 from -14.8, the surveyed households'
expectations regarding their own financial situation decreased again
slightly to -7.3 from -6.6.

The likelihood of consumers making major purchases remained below
average, with the relevant sub-index standing at -20.0 vs. -16.1 in the
prior quarter.

Although the expected development of unemployment rose slightly in
January, the respondents' assessment of job security remained at a
similar negative level.
