Germany's construction sector contracted further in January, survey
results from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 46.6 in January from
47.1 in December. A score below 50 indicates contraction.  
  
The decline was led by a sustained downturn in work on commercial
building projects. Meanwhile, supply chain pressures continued to
increase, with January seeing longer lead times on building materials
and products.

Commercial construction activity logged a sharp fall, while work on
civil engineering dropped only moderately. On the other hand,
residential construction work increased for the seventh straight month.

Citing general lack of demand and fewer opportunities to tender, inflows
of new work increased in January. Employment increased fractionally for
the first time since February last year.

On the price front, the rate of purchase price inflation faced by German
constructors reached a 23-month high.  
  
Looking ahead, constructors remained downbeat about the prospects for
activity in 12 months' time, citing concerns about the investment
outlook.
