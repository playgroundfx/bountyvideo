Austria retail sales rose in December, figures from Statistics Austria
showed on Thursday.

Retail sales, excluding trade in motor vehicles and including petrol
stations, rose 0.8 percent year-on-year in December.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales increased 0.9 percent annually in
December.

Sales in the food-sector grew 12.7 percent, while non-food sector
declined 4.5 percent, the agency said.

In 2020, retail sales declined a real 0.3 percent.

"The temporary store closings hit the clothing and shoe trade
particularly hard: Here sales fell sharply by 23.7 percent," Tobias
Thomas, General Director of Statistics Austria, said.

Sales of food, beverages and tobacco products grew 7.0 percent and sales
in non-foodstuffs decline 3.9 percent.
