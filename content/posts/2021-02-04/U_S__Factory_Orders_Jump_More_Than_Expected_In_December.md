New orders for U.S. manufactured goods showed another significant
increase in the month of December, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department on Thursday.

The report said factory orders jumped by 1.1 percent in December after
surging up by 1.3 percent for three consecutive months. Economists had
expected factory orders to climb by 0.7 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in factory orders came as orders for
non-durable goods spiked by 1.7 percent, while orders for durable goods
rose by an upwardly revised 0.5 percent.

Shipments of manufactured goods also shot up by 1.7 percent in December
following a 0.8 percent increase in November.

The Commerce Department said inventories of manufactured goods also rose
by 0.3 percent in December after climbing by 0.8 percent in the previous
month.

With shipments rising by more than inventories, the inventories-to-
shipments ratio dropped to 1.39 in December from 1.41 in November.
