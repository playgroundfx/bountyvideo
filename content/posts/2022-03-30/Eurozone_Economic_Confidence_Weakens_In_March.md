Eurozone economic confidence weakened more-than-expected in March mainly
due to plummeting consumer confidence, monthly survey results from the
European Commission showed on Wednesday.

The economic sentiment index fell to 108.5 in March from 113.9 a month
ago. The reading was seen at 109.0.

The decline in the ESI in March was mostly due to plummeting consumer
confidence, accompanied by marked losses in retail trade and industry
confidence.

The consumer confidence declined sharply to -18.7, in line with the
flash estimate, from -8.8 in February. The decrease was largely caused
by the collapse in households' expectations about the general economic
situation and own future financial situation.

Reflecting the sharpest drop in managers' production expectations since
the COVID-19 pandemic, the industrial confidence dropped to a one-year
low of 10.4 from 14.1 in February. However, the score was above the
economists' forecast of 9.0.

After rising for two straight months, the services sentiment index came
in at 14.4, up from 12.9 in the previous month and better than the
expected level of 10.0.

Meanwhile, the sentiment indicator for retailers slid to 0.2 from 5.5 in
February. The marked downturn in confidence resulted from the slump in
managers' assessments of their expected [business][1] situation.

Construction confidence remained broadly unchanged, down only 0.1, as
managers' improved appraisal of the level of order books was offset by
more muted employment expectations.

After reaching record high levels in February, business managers'
Employment Expectations Indicator eased 0.9 points to 115.5 in March.

Further, the survey showed that selling price expectations for the next
three months rose to unprecedented levels in all surveyed business
sectors. After four months of a broadly horizontal movement, consumers'
price expectations for the next twelve months surged to an all-time
high.
