New Zealand [business][1] confidence improved in March as the worst
fears about the impact of Omicron waned, survey results from ANZ showed
on Wednesday.

The business sentiment index rose to -41.9 in March from -51.8 in
February. At the same time, the own activity outlook indicator came in
at +3.3, up from -2.2 a month ago.

Activity indicators generally lifted slightly across the board, with the
marked exception of residential building intentions, the survey showed.
Consistent with the sharp turn evident in house sales data, the
residential construction intentions slid to -26.9 from -5.0.

The export intentions index advanced to 7.9 from 0.9 and the indicator
for investment intentions climbed to 5.2 from 4.5.

The employment intentions gauge moved up to 12.3 from 2.3, and the
profit expectations index came in at -27.1 versus -32.7 in the previous
month.

A net 96 percent of firms report that they expect higher costs. The
survey revealed that pricing intentions took yet another meaningful leg
higher to a net  
81 percent in March.

Inflation pressures increased further, with the commodity price impact
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine giving pressures fresh impetus.
Inflation expectations rose 0.3 percentage points to a new record high
of 5.5 percent.
