Private sector employment in the U.S. increased by slightly more than
expected in the month of March, according to a report released by
payroll processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 455,000 jobs in March after
surging by an upwardly revised 486,000 jobs in February.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 450,000
jobs compared to the addition of 475,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"Job growth was broad-based across sectors in March, contributing to the
nearly 1.5 million jobs added for the first quarter in 2022," said ADP
chief economist Nela Richardson.
