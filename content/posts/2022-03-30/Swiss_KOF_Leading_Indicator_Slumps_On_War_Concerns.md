A leading indicator of key turning points in Switzerland's [economy][1]
dropped sharply in March on concerns over the impact of the war in
Ukraine, survey data from the KOF economic institute showed Wednesday.

The KOF Economic Barometer dropped to 99.7 from 105.3 in February, which
was revised from 105.0. Economists had forecast a score of 100.8. The
reading fell below it long-term average.

"The recovery from the economic consequences of the pandemic is now
overshadowed by the war in Ukraine," the ZÃ¼rich-based think tank said.

"Overall, a moderate development of the Swiss economy can be expected
for the near future."

The latest decline was mainly due to indicators from the manufacturing
sector, followed by those for private consumption, KOF said.
