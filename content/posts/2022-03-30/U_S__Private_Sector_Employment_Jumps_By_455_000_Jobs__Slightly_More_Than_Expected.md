Private sector employment in the U.S. increased by slightly more than
expected in the month of March, according to a report released by
payroll processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 455,000 jobs in March after
surging by an upwardly revised 486,000 jobs in February.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 450,000
jobs compared to the addition of 475,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"Job growth was broad-based across sectors in March, contributing to the
nearly 1.5 million jobs added for the first quarter in 2022," said ADP
chief economist Nela Richardson.

"Businesses are hiring, specifically among the service providers which
had the most ground to make up due to early pandemic losses," she added.
"However, a tight labor supply remains an obstacle for continued growth
in consumer-facing industries."

The report showed employment in the service-providing sector spiked by
377,000 jobs, led by a 161,000 jump in jobs in the leisure and
hospitality industry.

Employment in the goods-producing sector also increased by 79,000 jobs,
as manufacturing employment rose by 54,000 jobs.

ADP said employment at small businesses climbed by 90,000 jobs, while
large and medium businesses added 177,000 jobs and 188,000 jobs,
respectively.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly jobs report, which includes both public and private
sector jobs.

Employment is expected to increase by 480,000 jobs in March after
jumping by 678,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate is
expected to edge down to 3.7 percent from 3.8 percent.
