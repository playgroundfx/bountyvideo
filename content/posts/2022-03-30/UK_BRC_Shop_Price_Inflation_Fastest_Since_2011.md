UK shop prices increased at the fastest pace in more than a decade in
March, data released by the British Retail Consortium showed on
Wednesday.

The shop price index advanced 2.1 percent on a yearly basis in March,
following a 1.8 percent rise in February. This was the fastest increase
since September 2011. Non-food prices were up 1.5 percent.

There have been mounting cost pressures throughout the supply chain for
some time, including rising wages, input costs, global commodity prices,
energy, and transport, Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.  
  
Many of these costs are beginning to be exacerbated by the situation in
Ukraine, but the full impact on prices is yet to be seen, said
Dickinson.
