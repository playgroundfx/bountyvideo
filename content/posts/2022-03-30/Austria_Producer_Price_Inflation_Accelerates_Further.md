Austria's producer price inflation continued to accelerate in February,
mainly driven by strong price increases in the energy sector and
intermediate goods manufacturing, preliminary data from Statistics
Austria showed Wednesday.

The producer price index rose 18.9 percent year-on-year after an 18.4
percent increase in January.  
  
Prices jumped 43.9 percent in the energy sector and rose 19.1 percent in
the intermediate goods industry. Producer prices climbed 3.1 percent in
the capital goods manufacturing and 4.1 percent in the consumer goods
industry.  
  
Compared to the previous month, producer prices rose 1.2 percent in
February, after a 2.4 percent gain in the previous month.

The monthly increase was driven by strong rise in prices in metal
production and processing, production of food and animal feed, and
energy supply.
