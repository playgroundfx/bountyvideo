Germany's consumer price inflation jumped to its highest level in over
four decades in March as the Russia-Ukraine war led to a surge in energy
prices.

The consumer price index rose 7.3 percent year-on-year, after a 5.1
percent increase in February, preliminary data from Destatis showed
Wednesday. Economists had forecast a 6.3 percent inflation.  
  
"Since Russia's attack on Ukraine, the prices of natural gas and mineral
oil products have markedly increased again and have had a considerable
impact on the high rate of inflation," Destatis said.

"A similarly high inflation rate in Germany was last recorded in autumn
1981 when mineral oil prices had sharply increased, too, as a
consequence of the first Gulf war."

Energy prices surged 39.5 percent annually after a 22.5 percent increase
in the previous month. Food inflation accelerated to 6.2 percent from
5.3 percent.

Services costs rose 2.8 percent, same as in the previous month and rents
grew at a stable pace of 1.5 percent.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the CPI increased 2.5 percent in March,
following a 0.9 percent rise in February. Economists were looking for a
1.6 percent increase.  
  
Annual inflation based on the harmonized index of consumer prices, or
HICP, climbed to a record 7.6 percent from 5.5 percent in the previous
month. Economists had forecast 6.7 percent price growth.

The monthly increase in the EU measure of inflation accelerated to 2.5
percent from 0.9 percent, much faster than the 1.8 percent economists
had forecast.

"The bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is that this will not be the end of accelerating
inflation," ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.

"For inflation, the only way is up and double-digit numbers can no
longer be excluded."

Official figures released on Wednesday showed that headline inflation
hit 9.8 percent in Spain, the highest since 1985, and 8.31 percent in
Belgium, the fastest since 1983.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday that the Russia-
Ukraine war has introduced considerable uncertainty into the outlook for
the Eurozone economy.  
  
Speaking in Cyprus, Lagarde said the economic impact of the war has
resulted in a "supply shock" that simultaneously pushes up inflation and
reduces growth.

"The best way that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can navigate this uncertainty is to
emphasize the principles of optionality, gradualism and flexibility,"
the ECB chief said.

Energy prices are expected to stay higher for longer, the pressure on
food inflation is likely to increase and manufacturing bottlenecks are
set to persist, she added.

Earlier on Wednesday, the German government took steps to rationing gas
supplies as deliveries from Russia are expected to halt over price
disputes.  
  
The government urged households and businesses to reduce energy
consumption in a bid to lower the dependence on Russian gas supplies.

Elsewhere, the German government panel of economic experts slashed the
economic growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 4.6 percent
predicted in November.
