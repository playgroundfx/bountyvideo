A report released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed the
U.S. [economy][1] grew by slightly less than previously estimated in the
fourth quarter of 2021.

The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product increased by
6.9 percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting a modest downward revision
from the previously estimated 7.0 percent spike. Economists had expected
GDP growth to be unrevised.

The slightly slower than previously estimated GDP growth primarily
reflected downward revisions to consumer spending and exports that were
partly offset by an upward revision to private inventory investment.
