The private sector in Hong Kong continued to expand in May, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Thursday
with a services PMI score of 52.5.

That's up from 50.3 in April and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Business activity recorded a solid improvement in May, supported by the
further easing of COVID-19 restrictions at the end of April. Although
some firms continued to be affected by lingering COVID-19 implications,
the improvement in output at the fastest pace since February 2018 was a
positive sign.

Driving the rise in activity was an improvement in order book volumes.
Specifically, new [business][1] from abroad rose for the first time
since March 2019 and this included new business from Mainland China
which saw growth after declining for three years for a row. The
stabilization of COVID-19 conditions was widely cited as a reason
contributing to the inflow of new business.
