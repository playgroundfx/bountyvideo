The UK service sector gained further momentum in May on higher spending
in response to looser pandemic restrictions, final data from IHS Markit
showed on Thursday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply services Purchasing
Managers' Index rose to 62.9 in May from 61.0 in April and exceeded the
flash estimate of 61.8.

The score was above the 50.0 neutral level for the third month in a row
and signaled the fastest growth for 24 years.

Service providers reported an accelerated rise in new order volumes in
May, with the speed of recovery the fastest since October 2013, driven
by domestic demand. Meanwhile, export sales fell slightly in comparison
to April.

The latest increase in payroll numbers was the strongest since March
2015, with survey respondents citing a combination of new hires and the
return of employees from furlough.

The input price inflation was the steepest since July 2008. At the same
time, output charges pointed to the fastest rate of inflation since the
survey began in July 1996.  
  
Business expectations remained close to March's 14-year high, drifting
down only slightly since April despite strong inflationary pressures.

The composite output index came in at 62.9 in May from 60.7 in the
previous month. The reading was above the flash 62.0. The index
suggested the strongest expansion since the series began in 1998.

The latest survey results set the scene for an eye-popping rate of UK
GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021, led by the reopening of
customer-facing parts of the [economy][1] after winter lockdown, Tim
Moore, an economics director at IHS Markit, said.
