The private sector in Singapore continued to expand in May, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Thursday
with a services PMI score of 54.4.

That's up from 51.8 in April and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Both manufacturing and services registered stronger performances in May,
but the construction sector saw a sharp downturn. The finance and
insurance sub-sector registered another rapid rate of expansion in
activity.

The key domestic event that took place in May had been the
reintroduction of Phase 2 restrictions mid-month. Some respondents noted
an increase in output ahead of the setting of new restrictions
contributing to the overall improvement of [business][1] activity.
Foreign demand supported the increase in new orders, with renewed export
growth in May following a marginal fall in April.
