India's service sector activity contracted sharply in May, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The IHS Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 46.4 in May
from 54.0 in April.

Economists had forecast a score of 49.0. Any reading below 50.0
indicates contraction in the sector.

New work intakes declined for the first time since September last year
and new export [business][1] fell at the quickest rate in six months.

The 12-month outlook increased in May and the overall degree of optimism
weakened to the lowest since August last year.

The number of workforce decreased in May and outstanding business volume
rose further.

Input prices and output charges increased in May. The rate of inflation
remained sharp.

The survey showed that the composite output index, which combines
services and manufacturing output, fell to 48.1 in May from 55.4 in the
prior month.

"The intensification of the COVID-19 crisis and associated restrictions
suppressed domestic and international demand for Indian services,"
Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.
