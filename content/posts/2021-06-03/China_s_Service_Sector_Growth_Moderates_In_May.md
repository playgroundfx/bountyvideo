China's service sector growth moderated in May as activity and new order
growth softened since April, survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Thursday.  
  
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 55.1 in May
from a four-month high of 56.3 in April. Nonetheless, the score remained
firmly above the neutral 50.0 level to suggest a marked growth in
activity.

Business activity as well as new orders rose sharply in May, despite
rates of expansion softening since April. Customer demand continued to
expand due to the successful containment of COVID-19 in China, while
there were also reports of new product offerings boosting sales.

Employment across China's service sector rose for the third consecutive
month, with a number of firms adding to their payrolls due to rising
sales.

Cost pressures at service providers build further in May amid reports of
higher prices for raw materials, energy, staff and transport.
Consequently, prices charged by services companies increased again in
May with the rate of inflation the quickest recorded in 2021 to date and
solid.

The 12-month outlook for services activity remained strongly positive
but the overall degree of positive sentiment dipped to a four-month low.

Further, the composite output index fell to 53.8 in May from 54.7 in
April, to signal a softer expansion of overall Chinese [business][1]
activity. Growth in both services and manufacturing sectors moderated in
May.
