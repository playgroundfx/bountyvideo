Australia's trade surplus increased notably in April as exports
increased amid falling imports, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
reported Thursday.

The trade surplus increased to A$8.02 billion from A$5.79 billion in
March. This was above the economists' forecast of A$7.9 billion.

Exports grew 3 percent to A$39.77 billion, while imports fell 3 percent
to A$31.74 billion.

As the increase in the trade surplus was largely driven by higher
commodity prices, export volumes will need to recover further in the
months ahead to prevent trade from being a drag on GDP growth yet again
in the second quarter, Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Another report from the statistical office showed that retail sales grew
1.1 percent on a monthly basis, as initially estimated, in April,
following a 1.3 percent rise in March.

On a yearly basis, retail turnover surged 25 percent in April.
