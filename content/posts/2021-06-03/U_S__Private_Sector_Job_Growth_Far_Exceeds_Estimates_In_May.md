A report released by payroll processor ADP on Thursday showed private
sector employment in the U.S. spiked by much more than expected in the
month of May.

ADP said private sector employment soared by 978,000 jobs in May after
surging by a downwardly revised 654,000 jobs in April.

Economists had expected private sector employment to increase by 650,000
jobs compared to the addition of 742,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

The jump in May reflected the strongest job growth since private sector
employment skyrocketed by 4.350 million jobs in June of 2020.

"Private payrolls showed a marked improvement from recent months and the
strongest gain since the early days of the recovery," said Nela
Richardson, chief economist at ADP.

She added, "While goods producers grew at a steady pace, it is service
providers that accounted for the lion's share of the gains, far
outpacing the monthly average in the last six months."

The report showed employment in the service-providing sector shot up by
850,000 jobs in May, with a jump of 440,000 leisure and hospitality jobs
leading the way higher.

Employment in the goods-producing sector also climbed by 128,000 jobs,
reflecting job growth in both the construction and manufacturing
sectors.

ADP also said large businesses added 308,000 jobs during the month,
while employment at small and midsized businesses increased by 333,000
jobs and 338,000 jobs, respectively.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly jobs report, which includes both public and private
sector jobs.

Economists currently expect the report to show employment jumped by
664,000 jobs in May after climbing by 266,000 jobs in April. The
unemployment rate is also expected to dip to 5.9 percent from 6.1
percent.
