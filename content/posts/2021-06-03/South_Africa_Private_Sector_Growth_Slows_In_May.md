South Africa's private sector expanded at a softer pace in May, survey
data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.2 in May from 53.7 in
April. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. This was
the second highest since November 2012.

New orders and output increased in May. Employment increased at the
fastest rate since November 2012 and backlogs of work rose for a third
straight month.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in May. Inventories rose for the
first time in six months.

Confidence for the next 12 months remained robust to the second-highest
in over three years in May.

Input price inflation increased to the quickest for nearly five years in
May.

"Output charges increased sharply and to the greatest extent in almost
five years, giving additional evidence of inflationary pressures that
could harm the economic recovery," David Owen, economist at IHS Markit,
said.
