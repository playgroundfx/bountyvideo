The construction sector in Australia continued to expand in May, albeit
at a slightly slower pace, the latest survey from the Australian
Industry Group showed on Thursday with a seasonally adjusted Performance
of Construction Index score of 58.3.

That's down from 59.1 in April, although it remains well above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

All four components of activity expanded strongly in May, with the index
for employment hitting a new record high. The indexes for activity and
new orders moved lower but remain elevated, as builders nationwide
scrambled to fill orders and commence new residential construction
projects ahead of HomeBuilder grant deadlines. Capacity utilization
inched back towards its recent high at 82.5 percent of capacity in use
in May.
