The average of household spending in Japan was up 13.0 percent on year
in April, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Friday - coming in at 310,043 yen.

That blew away forecasts for an increase of 9.3 percent following the
6.2 percent gain in March.

On a monthly basis, household spending rose 0.1 percent - again
exceeding expectations for a decline of 2.2 percent following the 7.2
percent jump in the previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 543,063 yen, up 2.8
percent on year.
