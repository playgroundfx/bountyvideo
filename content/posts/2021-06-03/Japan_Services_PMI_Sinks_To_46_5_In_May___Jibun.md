The services sector in Japan continued to contract in May, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on Thursday with
a services PMI score of 46.5.

That's up from 49.5 in April and it moves further beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New [business][1] declined at a faster pace in the latest survey period,
extending the current sequence of contraction to 16 months. The latest
reduction was the quickest for three months and modest.

Panel members highlighted that the rise in COVID-19 cases and the
reimposition of a state of emergency to curb the spread of infections
caused the fall in new work. Moreover, international demand for Japanese
services deteriorated further as key [markets][2] around Asia faced
stricter restrictions due to a surge in infection rates.

The survey also said its composite index slipped to 48.8 in May from
51.0 in April.
