A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed personal
income in the U.S. increased by less than expected in the month of
December.

The Commerce Department said personal income rose by 0.3 percent in
December after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.5 percent in November.

Economists had expected personal income to advance by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Meanwhile, the report showed personal spending fell by 0.6 percent in
December after rising by 0.4 percent in November. The decrease in
spending matched economist estimates.
