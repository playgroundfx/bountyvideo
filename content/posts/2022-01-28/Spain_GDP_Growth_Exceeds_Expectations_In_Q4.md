Spain's [economy][1] grew more than expected in the fourth quarter
despite the weakness in household spending, flash estimate from the
statistical office INE showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 2 percent sequentially in the fourth
quarter, faster than the economists' forecast of 1.4 percent. However,
this was slower than the 2.6 percent growth posted in the third quarter.

On a yearly basis, economic growth accelerated to 5.2 percent from 3.4
percent in the third quarter. The rate also exceeded the expected 4.5
percent.

In the full year of 2021, GDP was 7.2 percent higher than in 2020.

On the expenditure-side, household spending slid 1.2 percent and
government spending decreased 0.4 percent on quarter. Meanwhile, gross
fixed capital formation surged 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter.

Exports and imports were up 6.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively.
