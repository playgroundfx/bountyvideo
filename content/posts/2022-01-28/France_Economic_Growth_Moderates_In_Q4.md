The French [economy][1] logged a moderate growth at the end of 2021
after a strong rebound in the third quarter with the reopening in
several sectors of activity, the statistical office Insee said on
Friday.

Gross domestic product grew by a more-than-expected 0.7 percent
sequentially, following a 3.1 percent rise in the third quarter.
Economists had forecast a quarterly expansion of 0.5 percent.

After returning to its pre-crisis level in the previous quarter, GDP
exceeded it significantly by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

On the expenditure-side, household consumption grew at a slower pace of
0.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Likewise, growth in government
consumption eased to 0.3 percent.

Gross fixed capital formation gained 0.5 percent, faster than the
marginal 0.1 percent rise a quarter ago.

Foreign trade grew faster than domestic demand. The increase was more
marked on the side of imports, which grew 3.6 percent and exports rose
3.2 percent.

As a result, the contribution of foreign trade to GDP growth was
slightly negative, by -0.2 points. Finally, the contribution of
inventory changes to GDP growth was positive 0.4 points.

On average over 2021, GDP expanded 7.0 percent, in contrast to the -8.0
percent decline in 2020.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said household
consumption of goods declined in December due to the fall in energy and
manufactured goods spending.

Household spending grew only 0.2 percent after the 0.9 percent increase
in November. Energy consumption slid 1.3 percent and manufactured goods
consumption was down 0.4 percent.

Over the whole fourth quarter 2021, household consumption of goods
increased 0.3 percent.
