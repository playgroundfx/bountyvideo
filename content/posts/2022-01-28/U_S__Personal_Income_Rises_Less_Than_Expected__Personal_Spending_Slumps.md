A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed personal
income in the U.S. increased by less than expected in the month of
December.

The Commerce Department said personal income rose by 0.3 percent in
December after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.5 percent in November.

Economists had expected personal income to advance by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, also edged up by 0.2 percent in December after rising by 0.4
percent in November.

When adjusted for inflation, however, disposable personal income
actually dipped by 0.2 percent for the third straight month.

The report also showed personal spending fell by 0.6 percent in December
after rising by 0.4 percent in November. The decrease in spending
matched economist estimates.

Excluding price changes, real personal spending tumbled by 1.0 percent
in December after slipping by 0.2 percent in the previous month.

"Even assuming a bounce-back for each of the three months of the first
quarter, which seems unlikely given that Omicron and the child tax
credit expiry will weigh on spending in January, the devastatingly weak
end to the previous quarter means that we expect first-quarter real
consumption growth to be unchanged overall," said Paul Ashworth, Chief
U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

"Add in a slower pace of inventory accumulation, and we currently have
first-quarter GDP growth tracking at -0.5% annualized," he added. "To
our minds, despite the strength of price and wage inflation, it is
disappointingly weak real economic growth that will prevent the Fed from
delivering a full-blown Ratemaggedon this year."

With income rising and spending falling, personal saving as a percentage
of disposable income jumped to 7.9 percent in December from 7.2 percent
in November.

Meanwhile, a reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal
Reserve showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth accelerated
to 4.9 percent in December from 4.7 percent in November, reaching the
highest level since September 1983.

A separate report from the Labor Department showed its employment cost
index increased by 1.0 percent in the fourth quarter, pushing the growth
rate for 2021 to 4.0 percent.
