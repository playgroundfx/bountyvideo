Eurozone money supply grew at a slower pace in December and the annual
growth in credit to private sector improved, data from the European
Central Bank showed on Friday.

The M3 monetary aggregates logged a slower annual growth of 6.9 percent
in December after November's revised 7.4 percent increase. However, this
was slightly faster than the economists' forecast of 6.8 percent.

In three months to December, M3 growth averaged 7.3 percent, data
showed.  
  
The narrow measure, M1, comprising currency in circulation and overnight
deposits, grew 9.8 percent but weaker than the 10 percent rise in the
previous month.

As regards the dynamics of credit, credit to euro area residents rose
6.1 percent and that to general government advanced 11.3 percent.

Annual growth in credit to the private sector improved to 3.9 percent
from 3.7 percent in November. Adjusted loans to the private sector also
rose at a faster pace of 4.1 percent after rising 3.7 percent.

Among the borrowing sectors, the annual growth rate of adjusted loans to
households stood at 4.1 percent, compared with 4.2 percent in November,
while the annual growth rate of adjusted loans to non-financial
corporations increased to 4.2 percent from 2.9 percent.
