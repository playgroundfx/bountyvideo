The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to expand in January,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics
revealed on Friday with a manufacturing PMI score of 55.1.

That's down from 55.5 in December, although it remains above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Production at Taiwanese manufacturers rose for the second month running
in January, though the pace of expansion softened slightly and was only
modest. While many firms mentioned raising output due to higher sales, a
number of companies noted that shortages of inputs had weighed on
growth.

Although overall new [business][1] rose at a slightly softer pace than
in December, the upturn remained solid overall. Underlying data
suggested that greater foreign demand was a key driver of sales growth,
with new export orders rising sharply. Companies often cited stronger
demand across Europe, mainland China and the US.
