Consumer sentiment in the U.S. deteriorated by more than initially
estimated in the month of January, according to revised data released by
the University of Michigan on Friday.

The report showed the consumer sentiment index for January was
downwardly revised to 67.2 from a preliminary reading of 68.8.
Economists had expected a more modest downward revision to a reading of
68.7.

With the downward revision, the index was further below the final
December reading of 70.6, dropping to its lowest level since hitting
93.7 in November 2011.

"Although their primary concern is rising inflation and falling real
incomes, consumers may misinterpret the Fed's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) moves to slow the
[economy][1] as part of the problem rather than part of the solution,"
said Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin.

He added, "The danger is that consumers may overreact to these tiny
nudges, especially given the uncertainties about the [coronavirus][2]
and other heightened geopolitical risks."

The report showed the index of consumer expectations slid to 64.1 in
January from 68.3 in December, while the current economic conditions
index fell to 72.0 from 74.2.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations ticked up to 4.9
percent in January from 4.8 percent in December. Five-year inflation
expectations also rose to 3.1 percent from 2.9 percent.
