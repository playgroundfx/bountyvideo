Wholesale inventories in the U.S. increased by slightly more than
anticipated in the month of February, the Commerce Department revealed
in a report released on Friday.

The report said wholesale inventories climbed by 0.6 percent in February
after spiking by an upwardly revised 1.4 percent in January.

Economists had expected wholesale inventories to rise by 0.5 percent
compared to the 1.3 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

The slightly bigger than expected increase in wholesale inventories came
as inventories of non-durable goods surged up by 1.1 percent and
inventories of durable goods rose by 0.3 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed wholesales sales fell by 0.8 percent in
February after soaring by 4.4 percent in January.

Sales of durable goods tumbled by 2.2 percent during the month, more
than offsetting a 0.5 percent increase in sales of non-durable goods.

With inventories rising and sales slumping, the inventories/sales ratio
for merchant wholesalers ticked up to 1.27 in February from 1.25 in
January.

Next Thursday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a
separate report on [business][1] inventories in the month of February.
Business inventories are expected to rise by 0.4 percent.
