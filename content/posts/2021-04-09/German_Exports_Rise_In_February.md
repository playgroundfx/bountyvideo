Germany's exports continued to grow in February and imports rebounded
more than expected, data from Destatis revealed on Friday.

Exports increased 0.9 percent on month, but slower than the 1.6 percent
rise in January. This was also slightly weaker than the economists'
forecast of 1 percent.

Meanwhile, imports rebounded 3.6 percent after falling 3.5 percent in
January. Economists had forecast a moderate growth of 2.4 percent for
February.

The trade surplus fell to a seasonally adjusted about EUR 19.2 billion
from EUR 21.3 billion a month ago. The expected level was EUR 20
billion.

Year-on-year, exports slid 1.2 percent, following a 7.9 percent decrease
in January. Imports were up 0.9 percent versus a 9.2 percent fall a
month ago.

The trade surplus totaled unadjusted EUR 18.1 billion compared to EUR
20.3 billion in the same period last year.

The current account surplus declined to EUR 18.8 billion from EUR 21.6
billion last year.
