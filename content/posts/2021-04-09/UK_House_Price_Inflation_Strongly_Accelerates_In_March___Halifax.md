UK house price inflation accelerated sharply in March to its highest
level in four months, survey data from the Lloyds Bank unit Halifax and
IHS Markit showed Friday.  
  
The house price index rose an unadjusted 6.5 percent year-on-year after
a 5.2 percent increase in February.  
  
Compared to the previous month, house prices rose 1.1 percent in March
after remaining unchanged in February. The monthly increase was the
first since November.  
  
The average house price hit a record high GBP 254,606 in March.  
  
Halifax Managing Director Russell Galley said the continuation of
government support measures largely boosted confidence in the housing
market.  
  
The extended stamp duty holiday has put another spring in the step of
home movers, he said.

Meanwhile, the new mortgage guarantee scheme provides an alternative
route onto the property ladder to savers.  
  
"Overall we expect elevated levels of activity to be maintained in the
coming months, with consumer confidence spurred on by the successful
vaccine rollout, and buyer demand still fueled by a desire for larger
properties and more outdoor space, as work-life priorities have shifted
during the pandemic," Galley said.  
  
"A shortage of homes for sale will also support prices in the short
term, as lower availability always favors sellers."

That said, Halifax remained cautious about the longer-term outlook as
the [economy][1] is yet to feel the full effect of its biggest recession
in more than 300 years.

"Given current levels of uncertainty and the potential for higher
unemployment, we still expect house price growth to slow somewhat by the
end of this year," Galley said.
