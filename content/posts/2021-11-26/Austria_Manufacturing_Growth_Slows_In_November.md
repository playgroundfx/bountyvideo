indicates expansion in the sector.

lowest since the penultimate month of 2020, while manufacturers remained
hopeful for the next 12 months.

November.

On the price front, overall input prices increased in November with the
rate of inflation fastest on record. Output costs decreased to the
lowest in three months.

Growth in purchasing activity eased to the lowest in nine months in
November and stocks of finished goods increased.

Job creation declined to the weakest since July and was the fastest
recorded since the survey began in October 1998. Backlogs of work rose
