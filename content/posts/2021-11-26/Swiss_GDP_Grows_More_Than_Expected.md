Switzerland's economic growth slowed slightly in the third quarter, but
the expansion was better than expected, preliminary data from the State
Secretariat For Economic Affairs or SECO showed Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 1.7 percent from the second quarter, when
the [economy][1] expanded 1.8 percent. Economists had forecast 1.6
percent increase.  
  
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, GDP increased 4.1 percent after
an 8.6 percent growth in the previous quarter. Economists had forecast
3.2 percent expansion.  
  
Value added grew significantly in the services sectors due to the
further easing of Covid restrictions and private consumption rose
substantially, SECO said.  
  
Overall, GDP was more than 1 percent higher in the third quarter than
the pre-crisis level seen in the fourth quarter of 2019, the SECO added.
