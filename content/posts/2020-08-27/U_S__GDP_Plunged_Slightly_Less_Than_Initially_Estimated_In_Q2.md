Economic activity in the U.S. contracted slightly less than initially
estimated in the second quarter, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department, although the report still showed a sharp drop in
gross domestic product.

The report said real gross domestic product plummeted by 31.7 percent in
the second quarter compared to the previously reported 32.9 percent
nosedive. Economists had expected the plunge in GDP to be revised to
32.5 percent.

The smaller than previously estimated drop in GDP came as private
inventory investment and consumer spending decreased less than
previously estimated.
