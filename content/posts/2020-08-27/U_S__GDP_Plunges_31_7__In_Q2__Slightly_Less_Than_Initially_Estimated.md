Economic activity in the U.S. contracted slightly less than initially
estimated in the second quarter, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department, although the report still showed a sharp drop in
gross domestic product.

The report said real gross domestic product plummeted by 31.7 percent in
the second quarter compared to the previously reported 32.9 percent
nosedive. Economists had expected the plunge in GDP to be revised to
32.5 percent.

Despite the revision, the steep drop in GDP in the second quarter still
represented the biggest economic contraction on record.

The Commerce Department said the smaller than previously estimated drop
in GDP came as private inventory investment and consumer spending
decreased less than previously estimated.

However, Lydia Boussour, Senior U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics, said
the modest revision "adds little to a story that has already been
written."

"While the [economy][1] has since made some headway towards recovery,
the figure is an important testament to the sharp economic pain
inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic and should motivate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers
to get their act together to preserve the nascent recovery," Boussour
said.

The report said the nosedive in GD in the second quarter, which followed
a 5.0 percent slump in the first quarter, reflected decreases in
consumer spending, exports, non-residential fixed investment, private
inventory investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local
government spending.

The negative contributions were partly offset by a spike in federal
government spending and a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction
in the calculation of GDP.

"The fastest recession in U.S. [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) has been followed by an
unprecedented growth spurt," Boussour said. "But the nascent economic
recovery is showing signs of fizzling out."

She added, "With a [health][2] solution still out of reach and the
economic rebound looking fragile, fiscal stimulus is urgently needed to
prevent the economy from sliding back into a downturn."
