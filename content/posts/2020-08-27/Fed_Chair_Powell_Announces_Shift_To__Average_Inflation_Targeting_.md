In a highly anticipated speech on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome
Powell announced a widely expected shift with regard to the price-
stability side of the central bank's dual mandate.

Powell revealed in a live-streamed speech to the Jackson Hole economic
symposium that the Fed will change its approach to a "flexible form of
average inflation targeting."

The Fed chief stressed that the longer-run goal continues to be an
inflation rate of 2 percent but noted inflation will average less than
that if it runs below 2 percent following economic downturns and never
moves above that level even when the [economy][1] is strong.

"Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that
inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and
pull realized inflation down," Powell said.

He added, "To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could
ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve
inflation that averages 2 percent over time."

Powell said appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will therefore likely aim to
achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods when
inflation has been running below that level.

"In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we
are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that
defines the average," Powell said. "Thus, our approach could be viewed
as a flexible form of average inflation targeting."

Powell stressed the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions will not be dictated
by any formula and said the central bank will not hesitate to act if
excessive inflationary pressures were to build.

Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, expects the
Fed's adoption of average inflation targeting to "trigger additional
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus in the form of stronger forward guidance and possibly
additional asset purchases too."

"But, with long-term interest rates already so low and the Fed still
ruling out negative rates as undesirable, we don't expect that
additional stimulus to provide any significant boost to the real
economy, which means the Fed might struggle to hit its 2% inflation rate
at all, let alone deliver above-target inflation," Ashworth said.

With regard to the employment side of the Fed's dual mandate, Powell
noted the central bank's revised strategy emphasizes that maximum
employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal.

The Fed chief said the revised statement says [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions will be
informed by "assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its
maximum level" rather than by "deviations from its maximum level."

"This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust
job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation,"
Powell said.

Powell acknowledged the revisions partly reflect the way the Fed has
been conducting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in recent years but said there are some important
new features.

"Overall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy
Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals,
given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest
rates to the effective lower bound," Powell said.

"In conducting monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), we will remain highly focused on
fostering as strong a labor market as possible for the benefit of all
Americans," he added. "And we will steadfastly seek to achieve a 2
percent inflation rate over time."
