After reporting an unexpected increase in first-time claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits in the previous week, the Labor Department
released a report on Thursday showing initial jobless claims pulled back
in the week ended August 22nd.

The report said initial jobless claims dropped to 1.006 million, a
decrease of 98,000 from the previous week's revised level of 1.104
million.

Economists had expected jobless claims to decline to 1.000 million from
the 1.106 million originally reported for the previous week.

With jobless claims stuck above 1 million, Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead
U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics said, "The data show that layoffs
remain widespread and underscore that a full recovery in the labor
market won't occur until the [coronavirus][1] is well under control."

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also fell to 1,068,000, a decrease of 107,250 from the previous week's
revised average of 1,175,250.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 223,000 to 14.535 million in
the week ended August 15th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims plunged to 15,215,750,
a decrease of 604,000 from the previous week's revised average of
15,819,750.

Next Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more
closely watched monthly report on the employment situation.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 1.550 million jobs in
August after surging up by 1.763 million jobs in July. The unemployment
rate is expected to dip to 9.9 percent from 10.2 percent.
