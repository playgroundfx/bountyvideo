After reporting an unexpected increase in first-time claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits in the previous week, the Labor Department
released a report on Thursday showing initial jobless claims pulled back
in the week ended August 22nd.

The report said initial jobless claims dropped to 1.006 million, a
decrease of 98,000 from the previous week's revised level of 1.104
million.

Economists had expected jobless claims to decline to 1.000 million from
the 1.106 million originally reported for the previous week.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also fell to 1,068,000, a decrease of 107,250 from the previous week's
revised average of 1,175,250.
