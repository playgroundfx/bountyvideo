China's industrial profits increased for the third straight month in
July as the [economy][1] showed signs of recovery from the downturn
caused by the coronavirus pandemic, data published by the National
Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday.

Industrial profits advanced 19.6 percent on a yearly basis in July,
following a 11.5 percent rise in June.

During January to July, industrial profits fell 8.1 percent from the
same period last year.

In July, the equipment manufacturing industry showed notable growth in
profits driven by higher production of automobiles and electronic goods.
Profits of equipment manufacturing advanced 44.3 percent and that of
high-tech manufacturing climbed 36.5 percent. Meanwhile, profits of
mining industry declined sharply.

There is still a certain degree of uncertainty in future profit growth,
Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at NBS said.
