Switzerland's [economy][1] contracted at a record pace in the second
quarter as economic activity was severely restricted amid the
coronavirus pandemic, data published by the State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs, or SECO, showed Thursday.

Gross domestic product fell 8.2 percent sequentially in the second
quarter after falling 2.5 percent in the previous quarter.

This was the sharpest fall since records began in 1980. Economists had
forecast a quarterly contraction of 8.6 percent.

Compared to the situation in the fourth quarter, before the
[coronavirus][2] crisis, GDP slumped by a total of 10.5 percent in the
first half of 2020.

On a yearly basis, GDP declined 9.3 percent versus a 0.7 percent drop in
the first quarter and economists' forecast of -9.6 percent.
