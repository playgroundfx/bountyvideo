Pending home sales in the U.S. jumped by much more than expected in the
month of July, the National Association of Realtors revealed in a report
on Thursday.

NAR said its pending home sales index spiked by 5.9 percent to 122.1 in
July after soaring by 15.8 percent to 115.3 in June. Economists had
expected pending home sales to surge up by 3.0 percent.

Pending home sales increased for the third straight month after
plummeting in March and April and are now up by 15.5 percent compared to
the same month a year ago.

A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet
closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale.

"We are witnessing a true V-shaped sales recovery as homebuyers continue
their strong return to the housing market," said NAR chief economist
Lawrence Yun.

He added, "Home sellers are seeing their homes go under contract in
record time, with nine new contracts for every 10 new listings."

The bigger than expected jump in pending home sales reflected growth in
all four regions, with pending sales in the Northeast skyrocketing by
25.2 percent.

Pending home sales also surged by 6.8 percent and 3.3 percent in the
West and Midwest, respectively, while pending sales in the South edged
up by 0.9 percent.

Yun expects existing home sales to ramp up to 5.8 million in the second
half, bringing the full-year level of existing home sales to 5.4
million, reflecting a 1.1 percent increase compared to last year.
