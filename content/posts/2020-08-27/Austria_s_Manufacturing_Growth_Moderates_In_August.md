Following the record downturn caused by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic,
Austria's manufacturing sector logged a sustained rebound in August but
the pace of expansion moderated from July, survey data from IHS Markit
showed Thursday.

The UniCredit Bank Austria manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell
to 51.0 in August from 52.8 in July. However, a score above 50 indicates
expansion.

The rates of growth in both output and new orders were slower than in
July. The main drag was from ongoing weakness in demand for investment
goods. Export sales returned to growth in August after falling for six
months.

Employment decreased markedly as rate of staff cuts reaccelerated in
August.

On the price front, the survey revealed that average purchase prices
fell at the slowest rate for 14 months. At the same time, the decline in
factory gate charges eased in August.

Lastly, the survey showed increased optimism towards the outlook for
production, with expectations recovering further from April's record low
to the highest for six months.
