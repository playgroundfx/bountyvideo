South Korea's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged at a
record low and downgraded its GDP outlook as authorities enhanced
[coronavirus][1] containment measures.

The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided to hold its key
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 0.50 percent.

As economic growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures
on the demand side are forecast to remain weak due to the covid-19
pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance, the bank said in a statement on Thursday.

Policymakers observed that the recovery of domestic growth is likely to
be slower than previously forecast due to the domestic resurgence of
Covid-19.

The bank forecast the [economy][2] to shrink 1.3 percent this year
instead of 0.2 percent projected previously. Uncertainties around the
future path of GDP growth are also judged to be very high, the bank
said.

At the same time, inflation outlook was lifted to 0.4 percent from 0.3
percent.

It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run
at the mid-zero percent level this year, reflecting prolonged effects
from the drop in global oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary
pressures.

With little space left for more [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate cuts, the BoK is more likely
to turn to unconventional measures, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

Given that the Bank has already made a vague commitment to reduce
"excess volatility" in long term bond yields, the most likely next step
is an explicit yield target, which would be more effective in driving
down long-term yields and supporting the economy, Holmes added.
