Belgium's consumer confidence rebounded strongly in September to its
highest level in seven months amid improvement in all its components,
survey data from the National Bank of Belgium showed on Monday.

The consumer confidence index rose to -16 from -26 in August. The latest
reading is the strongest since March roughly at the start of the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, outbreak in Europe.

The index weakened in each of the previous two months.

Belgians were more optimistic regarding the general economic outlook for
the next twelve months. The economic expectations index of the survey
shot up to -20 from -38 in the previous month.

The measure reflecting the financial expectations of households turned
positive to 2 from -1 in August. The index showing their saving
intentions rose to 17, which was the highest in at least the past 12
months.

For the first time since the Covid-19 crisis, households gave a less
unfavorable opinion on the outlook for unemployment. The corresponding
indicator fell to 62 from 77. A decline in the index suggests
improvement in the assessment of the unemployment outlook.
