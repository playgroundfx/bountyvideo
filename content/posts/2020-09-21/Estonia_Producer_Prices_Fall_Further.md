Estonia's producer prices continued to decline in August, data from
Statistics Estonia showed on Monday.

The producer price index declined 2.2 percent year-on-year in August.

Prices of manufacturing fell 1.8 percent annually in August. Prices for

Meanwhile, prices for mining and quarrying industry grew 1.0 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices rose 1.1 percent in August.

"In August, compared to July, the producer price index was affected
primarily by price increase in electricity supply," Statistics Estonia

"Price decreases in the manufacture of fish and meat products, and
chemical products, had a big impact on the index," Sokman added.

percent from a year ago.
