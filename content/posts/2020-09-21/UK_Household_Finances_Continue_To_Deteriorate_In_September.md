UK households' perception about the financial well-being showed another
sharp fall in September but this was less severe than the fall logged at
the height of the covid-19 pandemic, survey data published by IHS Markit
showed Monday.

The household finance index remained unchanged at 40.8 in September.

Households' perceptions of their finances in 12 months' time weakened in
September, with the respective index reaching the lowest since May.

Spending decreased moderately though the reduction was the weakest in
the current six-month sequence of falls. Amid lower disposable incomes,
household savings were again depleted in September. Moreover, the latest
fall was the sharpest since December 2013.

Further, the measure of demand for unsecured credit, such as overdrafts
and credit cards, moved above the 50.0 threshold and hit its highest
level since April.

However, perceptions of job security remained extremely weak with the
index falling further into negative territory, registering at 39.9. Due
to squeezed wages and high uncertainty, households' appetite for major
purchases fell in September.

Given the latest figures and the recession the UK is facing during the
pandemic, there is undoubtedly a long and uncertain road ahead for UK
households to recover financially, Lewis Cooper, an economist at IHS
Markit, said.
