Hong Kong's consumer price declined for the second straight month in
August, data from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Monday.

The consumer price index fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in August,
following a 2.3 percent decrease in July.

The smaller annual fall in prices was mainly due to the effect of the
Government's payment of public housing rentals and waiver of two-thirds
of rent for tenants of in some housing estates in July dissipated in
August, the agency said.

Excluding the effects of all government's one-off relief measures, core
inflation was 0.1 percent in August versus 0.2 percent in the previous
month.

The underlying consumer price inflation rate edged down further as
economic conditions remained weak amid the third wave of the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19 epidemic, a government spokesman said.

"Prices of meals bought away from home saw a slightly larger year-on-
year decline, while price pressures on many other major CPI components
receded further," spokesman added.

"Looking ahead, price pressures on both external and domestic fronts
should remain tame in the rest of year amid subdued global and local
economic conditions."
