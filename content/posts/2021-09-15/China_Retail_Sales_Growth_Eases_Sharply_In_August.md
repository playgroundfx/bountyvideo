China's retail sales grew at a much weaker pace in August as the
outbreak of Delta variant weighed on consumption, and industrial
production growth softened amid supply chain bottlenecks and higher raw
material cost.

Retail sales grew only 2.5 percent on a yearly basis in August, data
published by the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. This
was much weaker than July's 8.5 percent growth and the expected rate of
7 percent.

Industrial production grew moderately by 5.3 percent year-on-year in
August, but slower than the 6.4 percent increase seen in July and the
economists' forecast of 5.8 percent.

During January to August period, fixed asset investment climbed 8.9
percent after rising 10.3 percent in January to July period. Economists
had forecast an increase of 9 percent.

In the first eight months of 2021, property investment reportedly grew
10.9 percent from the last year.

The surveyed jobless rate came in at 5.1 percent in August.  
  
Any near-term virus-linked disruptions should prove temporary, if the
flare-up in January is any indication, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

However, the economist said the same cannot be said for the headwinds
facing the property sector, which are likely to intensify further as the
prop to housing demand from savings built-up during the pandemic
continues to unwind.

The current strength of exports is also unlikely to be sustained as
global consumption patterns normalize coming out of the pandemic, the
economists noted.
