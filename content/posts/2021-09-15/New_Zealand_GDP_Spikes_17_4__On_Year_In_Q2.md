percent gain in the three months prior (originally 1.6 percent).

Service industries rose 2.8 percent on quarter, while primary industries
rose 5.0 percent and goods producing industries rose 1.3 percent.

GDP per capita rose 2.6 percent on quarter, while real gross national
disposable income rose 3.4 percent and average annual GDP to June 2021
