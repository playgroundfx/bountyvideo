Eurozone hourly labor costs dropped slightly in the second quarter, data
from Eurostat showed on Wednesday.

Hourly labor cost fell 0.1 percent on yearly basis, in contrast to the
1.3 percent increase registered in the first quarter.

The two main components of labor costs are wages and salaries and non-
wage costs. The costs of wages and salaries per hour worked dropped 0.4
percent, while the non-wage component rose 0.8 percent.

The fall in euro-zone average hourly labor costs in the second quarter
compared to a year earlier was mainly due to pandemic-related
distortions to the data that will continue to muddy the picture for
another couple of quarters, Jessica Hinds, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

Nevertheless, the spare capacity in the labor market will keep wage
growth subdued, the economist added.
