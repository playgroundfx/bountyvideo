UK consumer price inflation accelerated at a record pace in August,
hitting the highest rate since 2012, data from the Office for National
Statistics showed Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 3.2 percent year-on-year following a 2.0
percent climb in July. Economists had forecast 2.9 percent inflation and
also remained well above the 2 percent target.

The 1.2 percentage points increase was the largest ever recorded in the
12-month rate series that began in January 1997, the ONS said. The steep
change is likely to be temporary, the agency added.  
  
The increase reflects low base effects linked to the sharp fall in
prices in August 2020, most of which was driven by the government's Eat
Out to Help Out scheme.

Today' data signals the first step in a rise that may take inflation to
4.5 percent or above by November, Paul Dales, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

But as inflation will fall back almost as sharply next year, the Bank of
England is unlikely to raise interest rates until mid-2023. Nonetheless,
there is a whiff of stagflation in the air and the next six months of
soaring inflation will be an uncomfortable period for the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers,
the economist noted.

Compared to the previous month, the CPI rose 0.7 percent in August,
which was faster than the 0.5 percent increase economists had forecast
and July's nil growth.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of energy, food, alcoholic
beverages and tobacco, accelerated sharply to 3.1 percent from 1.8
percent in July. Economists had forecast 2.9 percent inflation.

The core CPI rose 0.7 percent from the previous month.

Another report from ONS showed that output price inflation accelerated
more than expected to the highest since 2011.

Output price inflation increased to 5.9 percent in August from 5.1
percent in July. The rate was expected to climb moderately to 5.4
percent.

This was the highest rate since November 2011. Petroleum products had
the biggest annual growth rate of 50.4 percent. Transport equipment
provided the largest upward contribution of 2.07 percentage points to
the annual rate.

On the month, the rate of output inflation was 0.7 percent in August,
down from 0.8 percent in July. The expected rate was 0.4 percent.

Input price inflation surged to 11.0 percent from 10.4 percent a month
ago. Prices were forecast to gain 10.3 percent. Crude oil had the
highest annual growth rate of any component of input prices in August.

On a monthly basis, input prices climbed 0.4 percent, but down from the
1.3 percent increase posted in July. Economists had forecast a monthly
growth of 0.2 percent.

In a separate communiqu√©, the ONS said house price inflation eased to 8
percent in July from 13.1 percent in June.

The average UK house price was GBP 256,000 in July, following the record
high of GBP 265,000 in June.
