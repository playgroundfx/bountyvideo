New orders for U.S. manufactured goods showed a substantial rebound in
the month of May, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Thursday.

The Commerce Department said factory orders spiked by 8.0 percent in May
after plunging by a revised 13.5 percent in April.

Economists had expected factory orders to surge up by 8.9 percent
compared to the 13.0 percent plunge originally reported for the previous
month.

The rebound in factory orders came as durable goods orders soared by
15.7 percent in May following an 18.3 percent nosedive in April. Orders
for transportation equipment led the rebound, skyrocketing by 82.0
percent.

The report also showed a notable rebound in orders for non-durable
goods, which jumped by 2.0 percent in May after tumbling by 9.3 percent
in April.

The Commerce Department also said shipments of manufactured goods surged
up by 3.1 percent in May following four consecutive monthly decreases.

Meanwhile, inventories of manufactured goods edged up by 0.2 percent in
May after falling by 0.5 percent in the previous month.

With shipments increasing by much more than inventories, the
inventories-to-shipments ratio dropped to 1.65 in May from 1.70 in
April.
