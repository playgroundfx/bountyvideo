Despite a deep recession, the euro area jobless rate rose only
marginally in May as the short-time work programs of member countries to
support jobs amid the downturn caused by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic
suppressed actual unemployment.

The unemployment rate climbed to 7.4 percent in May from 7.3 percent in
April, data released by Eurostat showed Thursday. In the same period
last year, the jobless rate was 7.6 percent.

However, the unemployment rate was below the economists' forecast of 7.7
percent.

The number of people out of work increased by 159,000 persons from April
to 12.146 million in May.

The unemployment rate among the euro area youth aged below 25 increased
to 16 percent in May from 15.7 percent in April.

Furlough schemes across the member countries helped to prevent people
from becoming unemployed altogether.

In the months ahead, the surprisingly stable Eurozone unemployment rate
is likely to continue to creep up, Bert Colijn, an ING economist said.

This is simply because the [economy][2] is unlikely to reach the level
of pre-crisis output anytime soon, leading to inevitable job losses
especially when short-time work schemes draw to a close, the economist
added.

In the EU27, the jobless rate increased marginally to 6.7 percent from
6.6 percent in April.

Data released by Spain's labor ministry showed that unemployed rose by
5,107 or 0.1 percent from the previous month, which was the first
increase in June since 2008.

Germany's unemployment also increased at a much slower pace in June due
to the short-time work program. Unemployment increased by 69,000 in
June, official data showed Wednesday.

However, in Italy, the jobless rate rose to 7.8 percent from 6.6 percent
in April, the statistical office Istat reported Thursday.
