After reporting an unexpected jump in employment in the U.S. in the
previous month, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday
showing another record spike in employment in the month of June.

The report said non-farm payroll employment skyrocketed by 4.8 million
jobs in June after soaring by an upwardly revised 2.7 million jobs in
May.

Economists had expected employment to surge up by about 3.0 million jobs
compared to the spike of 2.5 million jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

The Labor Department noted the improvement in the labor market reflected
the continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed in
March and April due to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic and efforts to
contain it.

However, the combined jump of 7.5 million jobs seen over the past two
months has only partly offset the combined nosedive of 22.2 million jobs
seen in March and April.

"The 4.8 million rise in non-farm payrolls in June provides further
confirmation that the initial economic rebound has been far faster than
we and most others anticipated," said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S.
Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "But that still leaves employment 9.6% below its February
level and with the spread of the virus accelerating again, we expect the
recovery from here will be a lot bumpier and job gains far slower on
average."

The bigger than expected increase in employment in June was partly due
to a spike in employment in the in leisure and hospitality industry,
which soared by nearly 2.1 million jobs.

Notable job growth was also seen in retail, education and [health][2]
services, other services, manufacturing, and professional and
[business][3] services.

The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate dropped to 11.1
percent in June from 13.3 percent in May. The unemployment rate had been
expected to dip to 12.3 percent.

The decrease in the unemployment rate came as the household survey found
employment soared by more than 4.9 million persons compared to the 1.7
million person increase in the size of the labor force.

Although the unemployment rate fell in May and June, the Labor
Department noted the jobless rate is up by 7.6 percentage points since
February.

Meanwhile, the report said average hourly employee earnings fell by
$0.35 or 1.2 percent to $29.37 in June.

Average hourly earnings also fell in May, with Pearce attributing the
drop to composition effects, as low wage workers were disproportionately
fired then rehired.

Compared to the same month a year ago, average hourly earnings were down
by 2 percent June following a 6.6 percent spike in May.
