With the value of exports falling by much more than the value of
imports, the Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing
the U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in the month of May.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $54.6 billion
in May from a revised $49.8 billion in April.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to $53.0 billion from
the $49.4 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider than expected trade deficit came as the value of exports
plunged by 4.4 percent to $144.5 billion, while the value of imports
slid by 0.9 percent to $199.1 billion.
