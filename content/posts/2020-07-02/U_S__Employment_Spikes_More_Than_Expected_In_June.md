After reporting an unexpected jump in employment in the U.S. in the
previous month, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday
showing another record spike in employment in the month of June.

The report said non-farm payroll employment skyrocketed by 4.8 million
jobs in June after soaring by an upwardly revised 2.7 million jobs in
May.

Economists had expected employment to surge up by about 3.0 million jobs
compared to the spike of 2.5 million jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate dropped to 11.1
percent in June from 13.3 percent in May. The unemployment rate had been
expected to dip to 12.3 percent.
