Finland consumer prices declined for the second straight month in May,
data from Statistics Finland showed on Monday.

The consumer price index fell 0.2 percent year-on-year in May, following
a 0.3 percent decrease in April.

Prices of cigarettes, long-distance train journeys and children's day
care as well as maintenance charges were higher from a year ago.
However, the increase was curbed most by reductions in the cost of
petrol, light fuel oil, diesel and hotel room.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices remained unchanged in May,
after a 0.3 percent decline in the previous month.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, fell 0.1
percent both on a monthly and annual basis in May.
