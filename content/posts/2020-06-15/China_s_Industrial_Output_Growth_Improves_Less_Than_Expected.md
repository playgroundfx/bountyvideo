China's industrial production grew at a weaker than expected pace and
retail sales decreased at a slower rate suggesting a slow recovery from
the [coronavirus][1] crisis.

Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that industrial
production grew 4.4 percent on a yearly basis in May, faster than the
3.9 percent increase logged in April but slower than economists'
forecast of 5 percent rise.

Retail sales dropped at a slower pace of 2.8 percent in May from last
year, slower than the 7.5 percent decrease seen in April. However, the
decline was faster than the expected fall of 2 percent.

During January to May, fixed asset investment decreased 6.3 percent from
the same period of last year after easing 10.3 percent in January to
April period. Economists had forecast a 5.9 percent fall.

The surveyed unemployment rate dropped marginally to 5.9 percent in May
from 6 percent a month ago.

The statistical office said the overseas epidemic situation and global
economic conditions have become more severe and complicated, and the
stable operation of the domestic [economy][2] still faces many risks and
challenges.

The economy is recovering, albeit slowly, Iris Pang, an ING economist
said. However, the economist forecasts the economy to shrink 3.1 percent
in the second quarter and 1.5 percent fall in the whole year of 2020,
unchanged from the previous projections.

Pang said unstable job market and healthcare concerns are the main
factors slowing down the recovery.

Further, data showed that house prices increased 0.7 percent in the
first tier cities in May. Prices in second-tier cities were up 0.6
percent and rose 0.7 percent in third-tier cities.

The People's Bank of China injected CNY 200 billion funds into the
financial system via medium-term lending facility at a rate of 2.95
percent, unchanged from the previous operation.
