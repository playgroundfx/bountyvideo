UK house prices increased in June as [coronavirus][1] containment
measures were eased, data from property [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove showed Monday.

Average asking price of property coming to market in England increased
1.9 percent in June compared to March before the housing market was put
on hold.

On a yearly basis, house prices advanced 2.9 percent in June after
rising 3.5 percent in March.

Releasing flood of pent-up demand, 40,000 new sales were agreed since
market re-opened on May 13.

Data showed that number of sales agreed recovered, to a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) rate of
decline to just 3 percent from a year ago.

There are no signs of panic selling or even a price dip, Rightmove
director Miles Shipside said. Buyers may now be trying to exchange
quickly, as there are signs of high pent-up demand and upwards price
pressure, rather than downwards.

Shipside noted that figures at present show an activity boosting and
price under-pinning dynamic between supply and demand, driven by low
mortgage rates and pent-up housing needs.
