Dutch exports declined the most since mid-2009 and imports fell for the
third month in a row, figures from the statistical office CBS showed on
Monday.

Merchandise exports fell 11.2 percent year-on-year in April, following a
4.5 percent decrease in March. This was the biggest contraction since
June 2009.

In April, exports of transport and machine decreased and conditions for
exports were less favorable mainly due to the sharp contraction of
German industrial production, the agency said.

Imports decreased 8.0 percent annually in April, following a 3.6 percent
fall in the prior month. This was the largest decline since October
2009.
