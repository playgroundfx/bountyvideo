in October.

Investment lending gained 3.8 percent on month to A$10.10 billion,
accelerating from 1.1 percent in October, bringing the value of overall
home loans to A$31.44 billion - up 6.3 percent.

On a yearly basis, overall lending was up 33.2 percent, owner-occupied
lending gains 17.2 percent and investment lending surged 86.9 percent.

Construction lending was down 35.2 percent on month but up 45.6 percent
on year at A$1.63 billion.
