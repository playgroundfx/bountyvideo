A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed
[business][1] inventories in the U.S. surged by more than expected in
the month of November.

The Commerce Department said business inventories shot up by 1.3 percent
in November, matching the upwardly revised jump in October.

Economists had expected inventories to increase by 1.0 percent compared
to the 1.2 percent growth originally reported for the previous month.

The report showed retail inventories spiked by 2.0 percent, while
wholesale inventories surged by 1.4 percent and manufacturing
inventories increased by 0.7 percent.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said business sales climbed by 0.7
percent in November after soaring by 2.2 percent in October.

Wholesale sales jumped by 1.3 percent, while manufacturing sales
increased by 0.7 percent and retail sales inched up by 0.1 percent.

With inventories increasing by more than sales, the total business
inventories/sales ratio ticked up to 1.25 in November from 1.24 in
October.
