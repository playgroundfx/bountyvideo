Partly reflecting a sharp pullback in utilities output, the Federal
Reserve released a report on Friday unexpectedly showing a modest
decrease in U.S. industrial production in the month of December.

The Fed said industrial production edged down by 0.1 percent in December
after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.7 percent in November.

Economists had expected industrial production to rise by 0.4 percent
compared to the 0.5 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

The unexpected dip in production came as utilities output tumbled by 1.5
percent in December after a revised 1.9 percent jump in November.

The report showed manufacturing output also fell by 0.3 percent in
December following a 0.6 percent increase in the previous month.

Meanwhile, the Fed said mining output surged up by 2.0 percent in
December after rising by 0.5 percent in November.

"Solid demand will keep industrial production growing strongly in 2022,"
said Oren Klachkin, Lead US Economist at Oxford Economics. "There are
still plenty of orders for factories to fill, and the recent spike in
Covid cases could keep goods demand elevated for longer."

"Meanwhile, industrial supply chains will continue to face a difficult
operating environment this year; the latest surge in cases already looks
to be exacerbating labor problems," he added. "While we expect
bottlenecks to eventually loosen, we shouldn't discount the risk that
supply chain conditions could still worsen before they improve."

The report said capacity utilization for the industrial sector edged
down to 76.5 percent in December from a downwardly revised 76.6 percent
in November.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to inch up to 77.0 percent
from the 76.8 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and utilities sectors dipped
to 77.0 percent and 71.0 percent respectively, while capacity
utilization in the mining sector rose to 79.1 percent.
