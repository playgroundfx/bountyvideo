The UK [economy][1] expanded at a faster pace in November underpinned by
services activity, data from the Office for National Statistics showed
on Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent month-on-month in November,
faster than the revised 0.2 percent expansion registered in October and
the economists' forecast of 0.4 percent.

GDP was estimated to be above its pre-[coronavirus][2] pandemic level
for the first time, by 0.7 percent.

In November, there was an increase in output in all sectors, with
services output the main driver of GDP growth. Services output grew by
0.7 percent.

Production output increased 1.0 percent from last month. This followed
two consecutive months of negative growth, with a fall of 0.5 percent in
October and a decrease of 0.7 percent in September.

Manufacturing was the largest contributor to production growth in
November, increasing by 1.1 percent. At the same time, construction
output grew 3.5 percent, following a fall of 1.7 percent in October.

In a separate communiqu√©, the ONS said the visible trade deficit
declined to GBP 11.34 billion in November from GBP 11.81 billion in
October. In November, exports grew 8.5 percent and imports climbed 4.9
percent.

The surplus on services trade totaled GBP 11.96 billion, largely
unchanged from the previous month. Consequently, the total trade surplus
increased moderately to GBP 626 million from GBP 151 million a month
ago.
