Import prices in the U.S. unexpectedly showed a modest decrease in the
month of December, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said import prices edged down by 0.2 percent in
December after climbing by 0.7 percent in November. The dip surprised
economists, who had expected import prices to rise by 0.3 percent.

The report also unexpectedly showed a steep drop in export prices, which
plunged by 1.8 percent in December after increasing by a downwardly
revised 0.8 percent in November.

Economists had expected export prices to surge by 1.1 percent compared
to the 1.0 percent jump originally reported for the previous month.
