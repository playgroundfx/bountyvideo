A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday unexpectedly
showed a steep drop in U.S. retail sales in the month of December.

The Commerce Department said retail sales tumbled by 1.9 percent in
December after edging up by a revised 0.2 percent in November.

The sharp pullback surprised economists, who had expected retail sales
to come in unchanged compared to the 0.3 percent growth originally
reported for the previous month.

Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said the
unexpected slump in retail sales appears to mainly reflect the ongoing
impact of higher prices and supply shortages.

The report showed sales by non-store retailers plummeted by 8.7 percent,
while furniture and home furnishing stores, clothing and accessories
stores, sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores and
electronics and appliance stories also saw sharply lower sales.

Sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers saw a more modest 0.4 percent
drop in December after creeping up by 0.2 percent in November.

Excluding auto sales, retail sales plunged by 2.3 percent in December
after inching up by a revised 0.1 percent in November.

Economists had expected ex-auto sales to rise by 0.2 percent compared to
the 0.3 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The Commerce Department said closely watched core retail sales, which
exclude automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services,
also tumbled by 3.1 percent in December after falling by 0.5 percent in
November.

Pearce said the initial wave of the Omicron variant of the
[coronavirus][1] appeared to have only a small impact, with food
services sales declining by a modest 0.8 percent.

"Factoring in the huge drop in control group sales and modest hit to
services spending, we estimate that real consumption fell by close to
1.0% m/m last month, which implies growth of just 3.5% annualized in the
fourth quarter," Pearce said. "As a result, we are lowering our forecast
for fourth quarter GDP growth to 4.0%, from 4.5%."
