Inflation concerns have contributed to a bigger than expected drop in
U.S. consumer sentiment in the month of January, according to
preliminary data released by the University of Michigan on Friday.

The report showed the consumer sentiment index fell to 68.8 in January
from 70.6 in December. Economist had expected the index to edge down to
70.0.

"While the Delta and Omicron variants certainly contributed to this
downward shift, the decline was also due to an escalating inflation
rate," said Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin.

He added, "Three-quarters of consumers in early January ranked
inflation, compared with unemployment, as the more serious problem
facing the nation."

Noting inflation's regressive impact, Curtin said consumer sentiment
among households with total incomes below $100,000 slumped by 9.4
percent in early January, while sentiment among households with incomes
over that amount increased by 5.7 percent.

The report showed one-year inflation expectations ticked up to 4.9
percent in January from 4.8 percent in December, while five-year
inflation expectations rose to 3.1 percent from 2.9 percent.

The bigger than expected drop by the headline index came as the index of
consumer expectations slid to 65.9 in January from 68.3 in December.

Curtin noted lower income households were more negative about the
prospects for the national [economy][1], while higher income households
had a more positive outlook.

The report showed a more modest decrease by the current economic
conditions index, which slipped to 73.2 in January from 74.2 in
December.
