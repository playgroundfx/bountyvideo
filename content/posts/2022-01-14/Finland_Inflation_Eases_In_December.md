Finland's inflation eased in December, preliminary data from Statistics
Finland showed on Friday.

The consumer price index rose 3.5 percent year-on-year in December,
after a 3.7 percent growth in November.

Inflation was curbed most by reductions in the prices of children's day
care, average interest rate on housing loans and consumer credit, long-
distance train journeys, and medical examination and treatment fees, the
agency said.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices dropped 0.1 percent in December,
after a 0.4 percent growth in the prior month.

The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, which is the EU measure of
inflation, rose 3.2 percent annually in December and fell 0.1 percent
from a month ago.

In 2021, inflation was 2.2 percent.
