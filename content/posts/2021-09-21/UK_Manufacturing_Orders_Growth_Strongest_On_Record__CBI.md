UK manufacturing orders grew the most on record in September, survey
data published by the Confederation of British Industry showed on
Tuesday.

The order book balance rose to 22 percent in September from 18 percent
in August, the Industrial Trends Survey revealed. This was the strongest
growth in orders since April 1977.

At the same time, the export order book balance advanced to -2 percent,
the highest since March 2019, from -16 percent in August.

However, output growth in the three months for September slowed for the
second month in a row. The balance fell to +16 percent from +22 in
August. A balance of 25 percent expects output growth to accelerate in
the next three months.

"Today's survey highlights how amidst a variety of supply challenges,
companies are beginning to struggle to meet high demand, Anna Leach, CBI
deputy chief economist, said. Despite close to half of manufacturers
surveyed reporting order books above normal, output growth has slowed
sharply, albeit remaining relatively robust.
