Indonesia's central bank left its key rates unchanged on Tuesday, as
widely expected, in order to maintain the exchange rate stability and
underpin economic growth.

The board of governors of Bank Indonesia decided to hold the the BI
7-Day reverse repo rate at 3.50 percent. The previous change in the rate
was a quarter-point reduction in February.

The deposit facility rate was maintained at 2.75 percent and the lending
facility rates at 4.25 percent.

The board expects economic recovery to continue in line with accelerated
vaccinations, strong export performance, wider opening of priority
sectors, and continued [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus. Economic growth was predicted to
remain within the range of BI's projection at 3.5 percent - 4.3 percent.

With the [economy][1] rebounding on the back of a fall in virus cases
but the rupiah holding up well, Gareth Leather, an economist at Capital
Economics, said the interest rates will be left on hold until the end of
next year.

There is concern that Fed tapering could put some downward pressure on
the currency, but Indonesia is generally much better placed to withstand
a shift in global risk sentiment due to an improvement in the current
account position, the economist noted.  
  
The central bank forecast the current account deficit in 2021 to remain
low in the range of 0.6 percent -1.4 percent of GDP.
