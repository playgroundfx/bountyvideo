The Bank of Japan will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Wednesday
and then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a modest
day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The bank is widely expected to
keep its benchmark lending rate steady at -0.1 percent, although other
forms of stimulus may be introduced.

Australia will see August results for the leading economic index from
Westpac Bank; in July, the index slipped 0.12 percent on month.

Taiwan will release unemployment data for August; in July, the jobless
rate was 4.36 percent.

China will provide updated prime rates for its one-year and five-year
loans; previously, they were 3.85 percent and 4.65 percent,
respectively.

Finally, the [markets][1] in South Korea (Chuseok Festival) and Hong
Kong (Mid-Autumn Festival) are closed on Wednesday; both return to
action on Thursday.
