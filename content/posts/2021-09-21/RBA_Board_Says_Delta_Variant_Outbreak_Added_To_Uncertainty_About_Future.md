The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia said the outbreak of
the Delta variant has delayed the recovery and added to the uncertainty
about the future.

According to the minutes of the meeting held in September, GDP was
expected to decline materially in the September quarter and the
unemployment rate was expected to rise, but the [economy][1] was
expected to bounce back as vaccination rates increase and restrictions
are eased.

The board discussed the implications of the outbreak of the Delta
variant for the Bank's bond purchase program.

With the economy expected to return to its pre-Delta path by mid 2022,
members assessed that, on balance, tapering remained appropriate.

At the September meeting, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers pressed ahead with tapering its
asset purchases. The bank decided to purchase government securities at
the rate of A$4 billion a week and to continue the purchases at this
rate until at least mid February 2022.

The board repeated that it will not increase the cash rate until actual
inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range.

The Board seems to be clearly set on a gradual program of winding back
QE over the course of 2022 in line with other central banks, Bill Evans,
an economist at Westpac, said.

No change in the purchase pace will occur until February when a further
taper of A$2 billion or A$3 billion per week can be expected, the
economist noted.
