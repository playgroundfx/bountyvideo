Hungary's central bank raised its interest rates in September, for a
fourth [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session in a row, and signaled it will continue to do so
in coming months, citing rising inflation and upside risks to the
outlook.  
  
The Monetary Council decided to raise the central bank base rate by 15
basis points to 1.65 percent, the Magyar Nemzeti bank said in a
statement.  
  
Policymakers also announced a 15-basis point increase in the interest
rate corridor, thus the overnight deposit rate was raised to 0.70
percent, while the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending
rates were lifted to 2.60 percent.  
  
The Monetary Council also decided to reduce the target amount of the
MNB's weekly asset purchases from HUF 50 billion to HUF 40 billion from
the week starting on September 27.  
  
"The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes
until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank
target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly
balanced on the horizon of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," the central bank said.  
  
The Council also considered it necessary to gradually phase out the
foreign-exchange swap facility providing forint liquidity and to tighten
the liquidity provided by the instrument.

The central bank expects inflation to rise further and stay above 5
percent for the rest of the year and core inflation is expected to rise
to close to 4 percent.  
  
The effects of the Bank's tightening cycle will be clearly felt in 2022,
the bank said. Inflation is expected to ease from the beginning of next
year before returning to the central bank tolerance band in the second
quarter. The consumer price inflation is expected to stabilize around
the 3 percent central bank target in the second half of 2022.
