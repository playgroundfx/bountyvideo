Sweden's central bank forecast the interest rate to remain at zero
percent until the third quarter of 2024.

At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, the Executive Board of Riksbank decided
to hold the repo rate at zero percent and it is expected to remain at
zero for the entire forecast period.

The board will also continue to purchase securities during the fourth
quarter, in line with the earlier decisions.

The board also decided to close the lending facilities that were
launched during the pandemic and to restore at the turn of the year the
requirements for the collateral the banks have to provide when borrowing
from the Riksbank.

In the near term, the Riksbank's inflation forecast has been revised up,
primarily because electricity prices have risen unexpectedly sharply.

The inflation forecast for 2022 was lifted to 2.1 percent from 1.7
percent and that for 2023 was retained at 1.8 percent.

The [economy][1] is forecast to grow 3.6 percent next year instead of
3.7 percent estimated previously. Meanwhile, the outlook for 2023 was
lifted to 2 percent from 1.9 percent.
