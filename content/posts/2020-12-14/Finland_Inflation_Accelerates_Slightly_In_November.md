Finland's consumer price inflation increased modestly in November, data
from Statistics Finland showed on Monday.

The consumer price index rose 0.21 percent year-on-year in November,
following a 0.18 percent increase in October.

Prices of cigarettes, vegetables, single-unit dwellings, wireless
telephone services as well as fees of medical examination and treatment
were higher from a year ago.

The increase was curbed most by reductions in prices of hotel rooms and
fuels, the statistical office said.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices fell 0.06 percent in
November, after a 0.09 percent rise in the previous month.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, fell 0.1
percent monthly and increased 0.2 percent from a year ago in November.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the retail sales
turnover gained 4.6 percent yearly in October.

The wholesale trade turnover declined 2.9 percent in October, while
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) consumer goods trade grew 8.8 percent.

Another report from Statistics Finland showed that the industrial
turnover in services declined a working-day adjusted 6.2 percent yearly
in October, following a 5.8 percent growth in September.

Turnover in the accommodation and food services activities declined the
most by 33.9 percent annually in October.
