The Czech Republic's current account logged a surplus in the third
quarter versus a deficit in the same period last year, data from the
Czech National Bank showed on Monday.

The current account surplus was CZK 70.5 billion, while there was a
deficit of CZK 61.7 billion in the same period of 2019.  
  
In the second quarter this year, the surplus was CZK 82.5 billion.  
  
In the third quarter, the current account surplus was 2.4 percent of the
gross domestic product on an annual basis, the bank said.  
  
The outflow of funds in the financial account totaled CZK 105.8 billion
and reserve assets increased by CZK 19.9 billion.  
  
The goods and services surplus was CZK 109.4 billion, or 5.7 percent of
GDP on an annual basis, in the third quarter. The figure grew by CZK
38.9 billion due to a bigger decrease in imports of goods than in
exports.  
  
The goods surplus grew by CZK 31.9 billion and the services surplus rose
by CZK 7.1 billion.

TheÂ capital account logged a surplus of CZK 18.4 billion, and grew by
CZK 12.9 billion year-on-year was due higher revenues from the EU budget
recorded on the capital account.
