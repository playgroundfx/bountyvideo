UK house prices are forecast to log robust growth next year as there is
strong evidence that people will continue to have their reprioritised
housing needs high on their life agendas, property [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove
said Monday.

House prices are forecast to climb 4 percent in 2021.

In December, house prices increased 6.6 percent annually, faster than
the 6.3 percent rise registered in November.

However, on a monthly basis, house prices dropped 0.6 percent after
easing 0.5 percent in November.

With the expectation of a return to more normality in the second half of
2021 and a likely 'fresh start' mentality for some, there are sound
reasons for continued positive market sentiment that will outweigh the
economic, political, and [health][1] challenges ahead, Tim Bannister,
Rightmove's Director of Property Data, said.
