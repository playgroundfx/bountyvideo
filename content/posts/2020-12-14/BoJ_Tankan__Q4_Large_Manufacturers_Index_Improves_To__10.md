Large manufacturing in Japan saw some improvement in the fourth quarter
of 2020, the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan Survey on [business][1]
sentiment showed on Monday with a diffusion index score of -10.

That beat forecasts for a reading of -15 as expectations were very soft
because of the global Covid-19 pandemic. But it was up from a score of
-27 three months ago.

The outlook came in at -8, again beating expectations for -11 and up
from -17 in the previous quarter.

Large all industry capex is now seen lower by 1.2 percent, missing
expectations for a fall of 0.1 percent and down from 1.4 percent in the
previous three months.
