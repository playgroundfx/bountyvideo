Large manufacturing in Japan posted some improvement in the fourth
quarter of 2020, the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan Survey on
[business][1] sentiment showed on Monday with a diffusion index score of
-10.

That beat forecasts for a reading of -15 as expectations were very soft
because of the global Covid-19 pandemic. But it was up from a score of
-27 three months ago.

The outlook came in at -8, again beating expectations for -11 and up
from -17 in the previous quarter.

The large non-manufacturers index came in at -5, beating forecasts for
-6 and up from -12. The outlook came in at -6, also topping forecasts
for -7 and up from -11 in the three months prior.

The medium manufacturers index was -17 with an outlook for -17, while
the medium non-manufacturers index was at -14 with an outlook of -17.

The small manufacturing index was at -27, beating forecasts for -36 and
up from -44, while the outlook was at -26. The small non-manufacturing
index was at -12, while the outlook was at -20.

Large all industry capex is now seen lower by 1.2 percent, missing
expectations for a fall of 0.1 percent and down from 1.4 percent in the
previous three months.

The index for business conditions came in at -10 for large enterprises,
-17 for medium and -27 for small.

Sales for FY2020 were seen at -9.1 for large manufacturers and -8.5 for
large non-manufacturers; -7.5 for medium manufacturers and -6.1 for
medium non-manufacturers; and -9.4 for small manufacturers and -8.5 for
small non-manufacturers.

Profits for FY2020 are seen at -25.5 for large manufacturers and -41.9
for large non-manufacturers; -28.8 for medium manufacturers and -38.5
for medium non-manufacturers; and -39.7 for small manufacturers and
-36.9 for small non-manufacturers.
