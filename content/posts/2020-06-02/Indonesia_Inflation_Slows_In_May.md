Indonesia's consumer price inflation slowed in May, data from the
statistics bureau showed on Tuesday.

Consumer prices climbed 2.19 percent year-on-year in May, following a
2.67 percent increase in April. Economists had expected a 2.7 percent
rise.

The latest inflation was mainly driven by an increase in prices of goods
including clothing and footwear, housing, water, electricity and
household appliances.

Prices also increased in [health][1], transportation, information,
communication and financial services, recreation, sports, and culture,
food and beverage and restaurant, and the personal care and other
services.  
  
Core inflation was 2.65 percent in May versus 2.7 percent in April.
