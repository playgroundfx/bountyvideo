The UK house prices declined at the fastest pace since 2009 as the
impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic filtered through the property
market, data from the Nationwide Building Society showed Tuesday.

House prices fell 1.7 percent month-on-month in May, in contrast to a
0.9 percent rise in April. This was the biggest fall since February
2009. Economists had forecast a fall of 1 percent.

On a yearly basis, house prices grew 1.8 percent in May, much slower
than the 3.7 percent rise in April and economists' forecast of 2.8
percent increase.

Housing market activity has slowed sharply as a result of the measures
implemented to control the spread of the virus, Robert Gardner,
Nationwide's chief economist, said.

Mortgage activity has also declined sharply. "Nevertheless, our ability
to generate the house price index has not been impacted to date, as
sample sizes have remained sufficiently large (and representative) to
generate robust results," Gardner added.  
  
The economist said the medium-term outlook for the housing market
remains highly uncertain, where much will depend on the performance of
the wider [economy][2].
