Australia's central bank left its interest rate and the target yield on
three-year government bonds unchanged on Tuesday, as widely expected.

At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia
board kept its interest rate at a record low 0.25 percent and the
targeted yield on three-year government bonds at around 0.25 percent.

Policymakers said this accommodative approach will be maintained as long
as it is required.

The Board said it will not increase the cash rate target until progress
is being made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation
will be sustainably within the 2-3 percent target band.

The bank observed that the outlook, including the nature and speed of
the expected recovery, remains highly uncertain and the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic is likely to have long-lasting effects on the [economy][2].
