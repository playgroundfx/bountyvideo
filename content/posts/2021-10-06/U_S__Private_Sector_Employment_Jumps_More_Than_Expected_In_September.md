Employment in the U.S. private sector increased by more than expected in
the month of September, according to a report released by payroll
processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 568,000 jobs in September
after rising by a downwardly revised 340,000 jobs in August.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 428,000
jobs compared to the addition of 374,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"The labor market recovery continues to make progress despite a marked
slowdown from the 748,000 job pace in the second quarter," said ADP
chief economist Nela Richardson.
