South Korea had a current account surplus of $7.51 billion in August,
the Bank of Korea said on Thursday - down from $8.21 billion in July.

The goods account surplus decreased to $5.64 billion, compared to $7.08
billion in August 2020.

The services account recorded a $1.0 billion surplus, up from the $0.88
billion dollar deficit one year earlier, owing to an improvement in the
transport account.

The primary income account surplus increased from $0.71 billion the year
previously to $1.11 billion in August 2021.
