Employment in the U.S. private sector increased by more than expected in
the month of September, according to a report released by payroll
processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 568,000 jobs in September
after rising by a downwardly revised 340,000 jobs in August.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 428,000
jobs compared to the addition of 374,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"The labor market recovery continues to make progress despite a marked
slowdown from the 748,000 job pace in the second quarter," said ADP
chief economist Nela Richardson.

She added, "Current bottlenecks in hiring should fade as the [health][1]
conditions tied to the COVID-19 variant continue to improve, setting the
stage for solid job gains in the coming months."

The stronger than expected private sector job growth was partly due to a
notable increase in employment in the leisure and hospitality industry,
which added 226,000 jobs.

Employment in the goods-producing sector also climbed by 102,000 jobs
amid increases in both construction and manufacturing jobs.

The report also showed employment at large businesses surged up by
390,000 jobs, while midsized businesses added 115,000 jobs and
employment at small businesses edged up by 63,000 jobs.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to increase by 488,000 jobs in
September after rising by 235,000 jobs in August. The unemployment rate
is expected to dip to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent.
