Germany's construction sector continued to contract in September with
supply bottlenecks, capacity constraints and strong price pressures
acting as headwinds to activity and new orders, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Wednesday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 47.1 in September
from 44.6 in August. However, a reading below 50.0 indicates expansion.

The weakest-performing area of construction activity in September was
civil engineering. By contrast, the downturn in commercial activity
eased noticeably to the weakest since March, while work on residential
projects moved closer to stabilization.

Inflows of new orders in the construction sector remained subdued in
September.

Employment rose for the first time eight months, while the rate of input
cost inflation retreated to a six-month low amid fewer reports of supply
delays.

There was further strong upward pressure on rates charged by sub-
contractors, which rose to the greatest extent in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
since 1999.

Looking ahead, German constructors on balance maintained a slightly
negative outlook for activity over the coming year.
