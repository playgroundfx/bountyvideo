Germany's factory orders declined notably in August largely due to the
weak demand in the auto sector, data from Destatis revealed on
Wednesday.

Factory orders fell 7.7 percent on a monthly basis, reversing a revised
4.9 percent rise in July. This was the biggest fall since April 2020.
Orders were forecast to drop moderately by 2.1 percent.

Excluding major orders, manufacturing orders decreased 5.1 percent from
July.

Although the trend in orders sectors other than automobile continues to
point upward, manufacturing is likely to remain a drag on the recovery
of the German [economy][1], Ralph Solveen, a Commerzbank economist said.

Domestic orders fell 5.2 percent and foreign orders plunged 9.5 percent
on month in August. Within foreign demand, orders from the euro area
grew 1.6 percent, while orders from other countries decreased 15.2
percent.

Producers of intermediate goods reported a fall of 2.8 percent in new
orders. Demand for capital goods was down 11.1 and that for consumer
goods by 2.7 percent.

Year-on-year, manufacturing orders advanced 11.7 percent after rising
26.1 percent in the previous month.

Data showed that manufacturing turnover decreased 5.9 percent month-on-
month, in contrast to the 1.9 percent increase in July.

Elsewhere, survey data from IHS Markit showed that the construction
sector contracted in September as supply bottlenecks, capacity
constraints and strong price pressures each continuing to act as
headwinds to activity and new orders.
