The private sector in Hong Kong continued to expand in September, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 51.7.

That's down from 53.3, although it remains above the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

A stable COVID-19 situation enabled [business][1] conditions to continue
improving, driving higher demand and output in September. Anecdotal
evidence suggested that the distribution of consumption vouchers also
had a positive effect on new orders.

Foreign demand however remained weak in September. New business from
abroad, including China, declined for a fourth consecutive month and at
rates faster than August. Survey respondents highlighted continued
COVID-19 disruptions upon foreign trading partners affecting incoming
new business from abroad.
