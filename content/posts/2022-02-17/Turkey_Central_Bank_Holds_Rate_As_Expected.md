Turkey's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged for the
second straight meeting, despite surging inflation.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to hold the one-week repo
rate at 14.00 percent.

The MPC said the recent increase in inflation has been driven by pricing
formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, supply side
factors such as the rise in global energy, food and agricultural
commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments.

"The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of
measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and
financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the
base effect," the bank said in a statement.

"While cumulative impact of the recent [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions is being
monitored, to create a foundation for sustainable price stability, the
comprehensive review of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework is being conducted with the
aim of encouraging permanent liraization in all [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools of the
CBRT," the bank added.

Under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, the bank had lowered the
rate by 500 basis points since September.

Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate is
likely to be kept unchanged over the coming months and, if anything,
political pressures mean that the next move in rates is more likely to
be down than up.
