Europe new car registrations continued to decline in January as the
ongoing semiconductor shortage negatively affected the sales across the
region, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said
on Thursday.

Passenger car sales fell 6 percent to reach 682,596 units in January,
marking a new historic low in EU car sales for the first month of the
year.

Looking at the four major car [markets][1], double-digit losses were
reported in Italy and France, while only Germany posted solid growth.
Sales in Italy and France were down 19.7 percent and 18.6 percent,
respectively.

Meanwhile, Germany's car sales advanced 8.5 percent and Spain logged a
moderate increase of 1 percent.

Data showed that various markets in Central Europe posted gains, with
Slovakia and Romania registering the strongest growth, although Polish
sales contracted 10.2 percent in January. In Western Europe, on the
other hand, almost all countries posted negative results.
