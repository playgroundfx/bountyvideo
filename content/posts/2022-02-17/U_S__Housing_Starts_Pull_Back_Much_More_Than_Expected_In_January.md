The Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing new
residential construction in the U.S. pulled back sharply in the month of
January.

The report said housing starts tumbled by 4.1 percent to an annual rate
of 1.638 million in January after inching up by 0.3 percent to a revised
rate of 1.708 million in December.

Economists had expected housing starts to edge down by 0.1 percent to a
rate of 1.700 million from the 1.702 million originally reported for the
previous month.

Meanwhile, the report said building permits climbed by 0.7 percent to an
annual rate of 1.899 million in January after spiking by 9.8 percent to
a revised rate of 1.885 million in December.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, had been
expected to plunge by 6.0 percent to a rate of 1.760 million from the
1.873 million originally reported for the previous month.
