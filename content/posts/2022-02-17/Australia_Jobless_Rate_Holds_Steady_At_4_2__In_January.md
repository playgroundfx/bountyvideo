The unemployment rate in Australia was a seasonally adjusted 4.2 percent
in January, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday - in
line with expectations and unchanged from the previous month.

The Australian [economy][1] added 12,900 jobs last month, defying
expectations for a flat reading following the increase of 64,8oo jobs in
December.

Part-time employment added 30,000, while full-time employment shed
17,000.

The participation rate was 66.2 percent, topping forecasts for 66.0
percent and up from the 66.1 percent reading a month earlier.
