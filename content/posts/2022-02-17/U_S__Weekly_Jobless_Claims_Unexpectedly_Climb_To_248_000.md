A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time
claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased in the week
ended February 12th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose to 248,000, an
increase of 23,000 from the previous week's revised level of 225,000.

The rebound surprised economists, who had expected jobless claims to
edge down to 219,000 from the 223,000 originally reported for the
previous week.

Meanwhile, the report showed the less volatile four-week moving average
fell to 243,250, a decrease of 10,500 from the previous week's revised
average of 253,750.
