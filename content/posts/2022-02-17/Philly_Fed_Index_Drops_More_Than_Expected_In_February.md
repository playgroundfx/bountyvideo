Manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area expanded at a slower
rate in the month of February, according to a report released by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity slid to
16.0 in February from 23.2 in January, although a positive reading still
indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to dip to 20.0.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said firms responding to its Manufacturing
Business Outlook Survey continue to anticipate growth over the next six
months.
