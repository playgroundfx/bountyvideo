Switzerland's consumer confidence weakened in the fourth quarter as
households' concerns regarding the economic situation and the labor
market increased amid a resurgence in the [coronavirus][1] pandemic in
Europe, defying expectations for a strong improvement, survey data from
the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, showed on Thursday.  
  
The consumer confidence index rose fell to -12.8 from -12.0 in the third
quarter. Economists had forecast a score of -8.0.  
  
The reading had plummeted to a low of -39.3 in the second quarter.  
  
"The sentiment remains gloomy, coming in well below the long-term
average of -5 points," SECO said.  
  
"Economic development and the situation on the labor market are seen as
unfavorable," the agency added.  
  
None of the sub-indexes showed significant improvement.  
  
The sub-index reflecting expectations on the general economic situation
rose to -14.1 from -16.8.  
  
The measure showing consumers' assessment on the past financial
situation fell to -14.8 from -10.0.  
  
The index reflecting their view on the financial outlook dropped to -6.6
from -4.2.  
  
The sub-index reflecting households' inclination towards big purchases
improved to -15.9 from -17, but remained below-average largely due to
the highly uncertain outlook.
