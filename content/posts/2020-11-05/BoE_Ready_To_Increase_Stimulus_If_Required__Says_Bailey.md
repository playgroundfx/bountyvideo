Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey on Thursday said the bank is
prepared to take whatever measures needed to achieve its remit.

At the press conference, he said it is important that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers take
prompt, strong and coordinated action.

Earlier in the day, the BoE had expanded its bond purchase programme by
a more-than-expected GBP 150 billion to GBP 895 billion and retained its
interest rate at a record low 0.10 percent.

The bank had repeated its guidance that it does not intend to tighten

progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2
percent inflation target sustainably.
