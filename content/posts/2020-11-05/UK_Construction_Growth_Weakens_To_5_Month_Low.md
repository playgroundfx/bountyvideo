The UK construction sector logged a sustained recovery in October but
the pace of expansion weakened to the slowest in five months, survey
results from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing
Managers' Index dropped to 53.1 in October from 56.8 in September.
Nonetheless, the sector has expanded since June.

Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said the construction
sector was a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy month for the UK
[economy][1] during October.

Among major sectors, house building was by far the best-performing area
of construction activity in October though the pace of recovery eased
only slightly.

Commercial activity also expanded but at the slowest rate in five
months. Meanwhile, civil engineering activity contracted for the third
month running.
