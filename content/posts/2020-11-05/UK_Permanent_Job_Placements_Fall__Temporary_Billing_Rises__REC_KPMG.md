There was a renewed fall in the UK permanent job placements in October
as greater uncertainty over the outlook amid rising Covid-19 infections
weighed on hiring activity, the latest KPMG and REC Report on Jobs
revealed Thursday.

However, greater uncertainty drove a further marked rise in temp
billings, according to the report compiled by IHS Markit.

The survey revealed another fall in overall vacancies. At the same time,
widespread reports of redundancies, and fears over current job security,
fueled a further sharp rise in candidate availability.

A combination of rising candidate numbers and reduced client budgets
contributed to further falls in starting pay.

"With a reluctance to recruit permanent staff and a big increase in
people available for work, the impending lockdown puts the UK jobs
market in a precarious position," James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG,
said.

"While the furlough scheme extension may give a brief respite, it will
fuel economic uncertainty and further dampen prospects for jobseekers,
hitting hiring activity hard," Stewart added.
