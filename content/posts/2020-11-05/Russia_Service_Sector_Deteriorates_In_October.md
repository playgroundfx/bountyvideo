Russia's service sector contracted in October, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Thursday

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 46.9 in October from
53.7 in September. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the
sector.

New [business][1] contracted for the first time since June and a solid
decline was seen in new orders. New export orders fell at a sharp rate
that was quickest for three months.

The number of workforce decreased in October and at the fastest pace
since June. The backlogs of work declined further in October.

Firms expect a rise in activity over the next 12 months, with the degree
of confidence falling to the lowest in five months.

Cost burden rose strongly in October and input prices increased. The
rate of charge inflation was solid, after easing slightly in the
previous month.

The composite output index decreased to 47.1 in October from 53.7 in the
previous month.

"A resurgence in virus-related restrictions and weak client demand
plunged the Russian service sector back into contraction at the start of
the fourth quarter," Sian Jones, economist at IHS Markit, said.

"Our latest forecast sees a 9.5 percent decline in GDP during the fourth
quarter compared to the same period a year ago, with the downturn
expected to be extended into the opening three months of 2021," Jones
said.
