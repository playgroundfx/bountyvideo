The UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Thursday announced a five-month
extension of the furlough scheme and an increase in the self-employment
grant.  
  
Sunak announced that the furlough scheme called the Coronavirus Job
Retention Scheme (CJRS) will run until the end of March with employees
receiving 80 percent of their current salary for hours not worked.

Initially, the furlough scheme was extended until December 2.

The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme was increased and the third
grant covering November to January calculated at 80 percent of average
trading profits, up to a maximum of GBP 7,500.

"It's clear the economic effects are much longer lasting for businesses
than the duration of any restrictions, which is why we have decided to
go further with our support," Sunak said in a statement.

"Extending furlough and increasing our support for the self-employed
will protect millions of jobs and give people and businesses the
certainty they need over what will be a difficult winter."

The chancellor also increased the upfront guarantee of funding for the
devolved administrations from GBP 14 billion to GBP 16 billion. This
will cover workers, [business][1] and individuals in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
