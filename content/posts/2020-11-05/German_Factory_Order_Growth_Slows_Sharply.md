Germany's manufacturing new orders growth slowed more than expected in
September as foreign demand remained subdued and the outlook is not
promising with the return of lockdown amid a resurgence in the
[coronavirus][1] infections.

Factory orders rose a seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted 0.5 percent
month-on-month in September, figures from the statistical office
Destatis showed on Thursday. Economists had forecast a 2 percent
increase.  
  
The pace of growth slowed sharply from August's 4.9 percent, which was
revised up from 4.5 percent.

The latest growth figure was the weakest outcome since April, when
orders plunged 26 percent amid the lockdown to fight the Covid-19
pandemic.  
  
Excluding major orders, real new orders in manufacturing rose 4.5
percent from the previous month.  
  
"After the first strong recovery after the lockdown in April, the
industry is still fighting its way out of the crisis," the [economy][2]
ministry said.

Factory orders almost reached their level of the fourth quarter of 2019,
99.4 percent, before the outbreak of the pandemic, the ministry noted.

On a year-on-year basis, factory orders decreased a [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted
1.9 percent in September after a 1.7 percent fall in August.  
  
In the third quarter, manufacturing orders grew 29.1 percent from the
previous quarter.

Compared with February, the month before lockdown restrictions were
imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic in Germany, new orders in
September were 2.6 percent lower, Destatis said.

Amid a resurgence in the Covid-19 infections, Germany and France
announced a fresh lockdown last week.

The European Central Bank has projected that economic activity is set to
slow significantly in the fourth quarter. The central bank has also
signaled a fresh round of stimulus in December.  
  
The economic recovery process in September was broad-based and was
driven by domestic and international demand, the economy ministry said.

In September, domestic orders increased 2.3 percent monthly, while
foreign orders decreased 0.8 percent. Demand from the euro area dropped
6.0 percent, and new orders from other countries grew 2.7 percent.  
  
Orders for intermediate goods grew 4.0 percent monthly, while those for
capital goods decreased 2.0 percent. Consumer goods orders rose 2.6
percent.

Destatis also reported that manufacturing turnover rose 1.1 percent
month-on-month in September. Compared with February, turnover was 8.9
percent lower. In August, turnover shrunk 0.1 percent.
