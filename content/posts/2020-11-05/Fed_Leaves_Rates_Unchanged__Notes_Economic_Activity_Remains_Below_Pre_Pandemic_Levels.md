Most Americans are focused on the outcome of the presidential election,
although members of the Federal Reserve still announced their latest
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision on Thursday.

The members of the Fed announced that they decided to keep the target
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent, as widely
expected.

The accompanying statement said the Fed expects rates to remain
unchanged until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent
with the central bank's assessments of maximum employment and inflation
has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent
for some time.

The Fed also said it plans to increase its holdings of Treasury
securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current
pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative
financial conditions.

In their assessment of the [economy][1], the members of the Fed said
economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain
well below their levels at the beginning of the year.

Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down
consumer price inflation, the central bank added.

The Fed also said overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in
part reflecting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures to support the economy and the flow of
credit to U.S. households and businesses.
