Austria's manufacturing sector logged its steepest declines in output
and new orders in over two decades as [coronavirus][1], or covid-19,
pandemic caused global economic disruption, survey results from IHS
Markit showed Tuesday.

The headline UniCredit Bank Austria manufacturing Purchasing Managers'
Index fell to 31.6 in April from 45.8 in March. A score below 50
indicates contraction in the sector.

The latest reading surpassed the previous record-low of 33.1 seen at the
depth of the global financial crisis in January 2009.

The output index fell to a historic low of 17.2 in April. With firms
reporting order cancellations or postponements, client closures, and
general uncertainty, new orders showed an unprecedented collapse.

Despite widespread use of short-time work, employment fell at a near-
record pace, as firms looked to cut costs.

Purchasing activity dropped to the greatest extent in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
in April. Due to lower demand for input, purchases prices declined.
Consequently, average factory gate prices fell at the steepest pace
since January 2015.

Output expectations hit a record low for the second successive month in
April.
