Eurozone banks are set to ease lending [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) for firms on account of the
support measures introduced by governments, the Bank Lending Survey from
the European Central Bank showed on Tuesday.

The survey revealed high uncertainty surrounding the likely impact of
the [coronavirus][1], or covid-19, pandemic and the different views of
banks on the impact on lending conditions.

Tightening of credit standards on loans to households are set to
continue in the second quarter.

In the first quarter, banks had tightened lending [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) for both firms
and households citing deterioration of the general economic outlook,
increased credit risk of borrowers and lower risk tolerance.

The survey showed that demand for loans from firms surged in the first
quarter due to the emergency liquidity needs in the context of the
coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, demand for housing loans
declined and demand for consumer credit turned negative.

Financial institutions expect that net demand for loans to firms will
increase further in the second quarter. A strongly negative net balance
for demand for housing loans and consumer credit is expected by banks in
the second quarter of 2020.
