French consumer confidence deteriorated at the fastest pace on record in
April after the government initiated [coronavirus][1] containment
measures, survey results from the statistical office Insee showed
Tuesday.

Amid lockdown, the consumer confidence index fell to 95 in April from
103 in March. However, the reading was above economists' forecast of 83.

"The indicator lost 8 points, its most important decrease since the
creation of the survey, in 1972," the Insee said.

In April, the share of households considering it was a suitable time to
make major purchases dropped substantially. The corresponding balance
declined 43 points to -59, the lowest since the creation of the survey.

Moreover, households' opinion balance on their future financial
situation decreased 15 points, which was the strongest fall on the
survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The score came in at -22, the weakest since May 2014.

Nonetheless, the index for past financial situation gained 5 points to
-7.  
The indicator measuring whether this is suitable time to save decreased
by 5 points to 4.

Households' opinion balance on their current saving capacity improved 4
points to 20 in April. On the contrary, the expected saving capacity
index dropped slightly by 2 points.

Households' opinion balance about the future standard of living slid 35
points in April, marking the strongest decrease ever recorded in a
month. At -71, it was the lowest level on record.

On the other hand, the indicator for past standard of living improved
for the fourth consecutive month. The corresponding balance came in at
-31 versus -33 in March.
