Norway's retail sales dropped in March, figures from Statistics Norway
showed on Tuesday.

Retail sales declined 0.9 percent month-on-month in March, after a 2.0
percent increase in February.

The latest decline was driven by a 23.0 percent fall in sales of other
goods. Sales of cultural and recreation goods and automotive fuels
declined by 18.1 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively.

Excluding motor vehicles and gas stations, retail sales rose 0.1 percent
monthly in March, after a 2.2 percent increase in the preceding month.

On a year-on-year basis, retail sales increased 1.3 percent in March,
after a 2.0 percent rise in the prior month.

For the January to March period, retail sales rose 0.3 percent, after a
0.9 percent fall in the three months ended in December.
