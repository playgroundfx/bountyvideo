Sweden's central bank kept its repo rate unchanged at zero percent but
does not rule out a rate cut later to stimulate demand and support
inflation in the recovery phase.

The executive board of Riksbank decided to continue purchases of
government and mortgage bonds up until the end of September 2020. The
bank will buy securities up to SEK 300 billion this year.

The central bank said it is prepared to continue to use the tools at its
disposal.

David Oxley, an economist at Capital Economics, expects interest rates
to turn negative later this year.

In order to facilitate credit supply in the [economy][1] and counteract
a rise in interest rates to households and companies, Riksbank ramped up
measures over the last few weeks.

The measures included offering bank loans of up to SEK 500 billion for
lending to companies and buying securities for up to SEK 300 billion and
offering loans to banks in US dollars.

The central bank cautioned that the economic consequences of the
[coronavirus][2] pandemic will be considerable.

The Riksbank has chosen to describe possible developments regarding
growth and inflation in two scenarios instead of in one detailed
forecast.

According to first scenario, inflation will ease to 0.6 percent in 2020
before rising to 1.5 percent in 2021 and 1.6 percent in 2022. At the
same time, the economy is forecast to shrink 6.9 percent this year but
to expand 4.6 percent in 2021.

In the second set of estimate, the central bank projected 0.6 percent
inflation this year, 1.3 percent in 2021 and 1.4 percent in 2022. GDP is
expected to contract 9.7 percent in 2020 before rising to 1.7 percent
next year and 5.4 percent in 2022.
