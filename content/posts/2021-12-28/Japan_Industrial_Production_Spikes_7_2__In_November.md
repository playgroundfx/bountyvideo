Industrial output in Japan advanced a seasonally adjusted 7.2 percent on
month in November, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on
Tuesday.

That beat expectations for an increase of 4.8 percent and was up from
the 1.8 percent gain in October.

On a yearly basis, industrial production improved 5.4 percent - again
topping forecasts for a gain of 2.5 percent following the 4.1 percent
contraction in the previous month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI upgraded its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it now showing signs of an upward
movement.

Industries that contributed to the increase included motor vehicles,
plastic products and iron and steel. These gains were offset by declines
in production among chemicals and petroleum products.

Shipments were up 7.4 percent on month and 3.5 percent on year, while
inventories rose 1.7 percent on month and 5.2 percent on year. The
inventory ratio slipped 2.6 percent on month and rose 0.4 percent on
year.

According to the METI's forecast for industrial production, output is
expected to rise 1.6 percent in December and 5.0 percent in January.

Industries contributing to the increase in December include transport
equipment and fabricated metals; January's gains are expected to be
supported by production machinery, electrical machinery and electronic
parts.

Also on Tuesday, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
said that the unemployment rate in Japan came in at a seasonally
adjusted 2.8 percent in November.

That missed expectations for 2.7 percent, which would have been
unchanged from the October reading.

The jobs-to-applications ratio was 1.15, unchanged from the previous
month but shy of expectations for 1.16.

The participation rate was 62.0 - unchanged and in line with forecasts.
