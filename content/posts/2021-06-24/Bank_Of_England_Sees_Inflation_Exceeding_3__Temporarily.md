The Bank of England expects inflation to exceed 3 percent temporarily,
and to fall back once the impact of rising commodity prices prove
transitory.

At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Thursday, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers
repeated their forward guidance and kept the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged, as widely
expected.

The MPC said it did not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at least until
there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made in
eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation target
sustainably.

Policymakers maintained the key interest rate at an all-time low of 0.1
percent.

They also retained the existing stock of corporate bond purchases at GBP
20 billion and that of the government bond purchases at GBP 875 billion,
taking the size of total quantitative easing to GBP 895 billion.

Citing a rapidly improving economic outlook and the rising cost
pressure, BoE Chief Economist Andrew Haldane voted against the
proposition to retain the size of government bond purchases.

At his final MPC meeting, Haldane sought to reduce the size to GBP 825
billion from GBP 875 billion. He had voted for a similar reduction at
the May meeting.

Other than the MPC noting the growing upside risks to inflation
alongside the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision, there were no real signs that it
is thinking about tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sooner, Ã  la the Fed, Capital
Economics economist Paul Dales said.

The economist expects the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to be tightened much later than the
mid-2022 date the [markets][1] have assumed.

The central bank expects the [economy][2] to experience a temporary
period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which
growth and inflation will fall back.

Consumer price inflation exceeded the 2 percent target in May.

"CPI inflation is expected to pick up further above the target, owing
primarily to developments in energy and other commodity prices, and is
likely to exceed 3 percent for a temporary period," the bank said.  
  
The MPC expects the direct impact of rises in commodity prices on CPI
inflation to be transitory. Nonetheless, the near-term upward pressure
on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected.  
  
The bank raised its GDP growth forecast for the second quarter to 5.50
percent from 4.25 percent in the May report. Output in June is projected
to be around 2.50 percent lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019.
