The Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing the pace
of U.S. economic growth in the first quarter of 2021 was unrevised from
the previous estimate.

The report said real gross domestic product spiked by 6.4 percent in the
first quarter, matching the estimate provided last month as well as
economist estimates.

The unrevised growth came as upward revisions to nonresidential fixed
investment, private inventory investment, and exports were offset by an
upward revision to imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation
of GDP.
