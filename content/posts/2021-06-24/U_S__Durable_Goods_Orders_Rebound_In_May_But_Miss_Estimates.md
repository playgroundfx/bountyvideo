New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods rebounded in the month of
May, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Thursday, although the increase fell short of economist estimates.

The report said durable goods orders surged up by 2.3 percent in May
after falling by a revised 0.8 percent in April.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to jump by 2.7 percent
compared to the 1.3 percent slump that had been reported for the
previous month.

The rebound in durable goods orders came as orders for transportation
equipment bounced back, spiking by 7.6 percent in May after plunging by
6.6 percent in April.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts soared by 27.4 percent in May
after skyrocketing by 31.5 percent in the previous month.

The report also showed a rebound in orders for motor vehicles and parts,
which jumped by 2.1 percent in May after plummeting by 8.1 percent in
April.

Excluding orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose
by 0.3 percent in May after jumping by 1.7 percent in April. Ex-
transportation orders were expected to increase by 0.7 percent.

The uptick in ex-transportation orders came as significant increases in
orders for primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances, and
components were partly offset by a notable decrease in orders for
fabricated metal products.

Meanwhile, the report said orders for non-defense capital goods
excluding aircraft, a key indicator of [business][1] spending, edged
down by 0.1 percent in May after spiking by 2.7 percent in April.

Shipments in the same category, which is the source data for equipment
investment in GDP, increased by 0.9 percent in May after jumping by 1.0
percent in the previous month.

"The continued strength of shipments suggests business equipment
investment is on track for another strong gain in the second quarter,"
said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.
