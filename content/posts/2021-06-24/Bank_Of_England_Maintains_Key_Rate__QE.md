The Bank of England kept its key interest rate and quantitative easing
unchanged, as widely expected, on Thursday.

The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee headed by Andrew Bailey
unanimously decided to hold the benchmark rate at a record low of 0.1
percent.

The central bank retained the existing stock of corporate bond purchases
at GBP 20 billion and the government bond purchases at GBP 875 billion,
taking the size of total quantitative easing to GBP 895 billion.

Citing rapidly improving economic outlook and rising cost pressure,
Andrew Haldane voted against the proposition to retain the size of
government bond purchases. He sought to reduce the size to GBP 825
billion from GBP 875 billion.

The MPC said it did not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at least until
there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made in
eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation target
sustainably.

Consumer price inflation exceeded the 2 percent target in May. Inflation
is expected to pick up further above the target, owing primarily to
developments in energy and other commodity prices, and is likely to
exceed 3 percent for a temporary period, the bank said.

The committee expects the direct impact of rises in commodity prices on
CPI inflation to be transitory.  
  
More generally, the Committee's central expectation is that the
[economy][1] will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and
above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall
back.
