French manufacturers' confidence remained unchanged in June, monthly
survey results from the statistical office Insee showed on Thursday.

The manufacturing confidence index held steady at 107 in June, while the
score was forecast to climb to 109. This was the joint-highest score
since August 2018.

The balances on the order books increased slightly by one point to -9.
At the same time, the balance on foreign order books, which has been
rising steadily since November 2020, advanced to -15 from -18.

Manufacturers remained optimistic about their own production prospects
but the indicator dropped marginally to 18 in June from 19 a month ago.
Meanwhile, the index for general production expectations rose to 27 from
19.

However, the manufacturers' judgment about their past activity was less
favorable. The corresponding index slid to 16 from 20.

Furthermore, at 30 points, the balance on the expected trend in selling
prices reached its highest level since the beginning of the series.

Regarding employment, the [business][1] managers' perception of the
development in their workforce size remained favorable. The indicator
for expected workforce size improved to +1 from -1 in the previous
month.

The overall business confidence index that comprises the responses of
business leaders from sectors namely, manufacturing, construction,
services, retail trade and wholesale trade, improved in June.

The business sentiment index advanced to 113 in June, the highest level
since mid-2007, from 108 in May.
