German [business][1] confidence strengthened to its highest level in
more than two years in June as the easing of restrictions related to the
coronavirus pandemic lifted expectations and managers' current
assessment, survey results from ifo Institute on Thursday.

The business climate index rose to 101.8 in June from 99.2 in the
previous month. The score was the highest since November 2018 and also
exceeded the expected level of 100.6.

Companies assessed their current business situation as much better and
optimism regarding the second half of the year also grew.

The German [economy][2] is shaking off the coronavirus crisis, Clemens
Fuest, ifo President, said.

The current conditions index came in at 99.6 in June. Economists had
forecast the index to advance to 97.8 from May's 95.7.

Likewise, the expectations index climbed to 104.0 in June from 102.9 in
the previous month. This was marginally above the expected score of
103.9.

In manufacturing, business confidence rose to its highest value since
April 2018. Companies were notably more satisfied with their current
business and their expectations were somewhat less optimistic.

However, many companies were concerned about increasing bottlenecks in
intermediate products.

In the service sector, business sentiment jumped higher. The indicators
for the current situation and for expectations both rose appreciably in
June.

In trade, the easing of restrictions improved the business climate
greatly and confidence in construction rose a little in June.
