A rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia is more likely in 2024, NAB
economists said Thursday.  
  
However, NAB economists said they can see a probability of the RBA
moving in the second half of 2023.

Markets should price in this risk, given the high bar the central bank
has given itself on wages growth being sustained at 3 percent plus, NAB
Economics Director Tapas Strickland said.

NAB economists predicated their view on the RBA sticking to its recent
evolution in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), that being trying to achieve the maximum
sustainable employment by waiting for actual inflation to be sustainably
in the band before tightening, instead of hiking on a pre-conceived
notion of where NAIRU is.

On Wednesday, RBA Assistant Governor Luci Ellis stressed that full
employment is essential for strong wage growth that can keep inflation
with the 2-3 percent target.  
  
Elsewhere, some economists predicted a rate hike in late 2022 and early
2023. The central bank's forward guidance is for a hike in 2024.
