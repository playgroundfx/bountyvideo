S&P Global Ratings affirmed credit ratings of India on Friday despite
weakening fiscal settings and a record economic contraction caused by
the global [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The agency maintained the rating at 'BBB-' citing the [economy][2]'s
above-average long-term real growth, sound external profile and evolving
monetary settings.

"India's democratic institutions promote [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stability and
compromise, and also underpin the ratings," the agency said.

"These strengths are balanced against vulnerabilities stemming from the
country's low per capita income and weak fiscal settings, including
consistently elevated general government deficits and indebtedness,"
said S&P.

The outlook on the ratings was stable as the agency expects India's
economy to recover following the resolution of the Covid-19 pandemic,
and that the country's strong external settings will act as a buffer
against financial strains.  
  
After experiencing a record contraction in fiscal 2021, India's economic
activity is set to begin to normalize in fiscal 2022, resulting in real
GDP growth of about 10 percent, the agency assessed.

According to S&P, India's fiscal deficit will rise to about 12.5 percent
of GDP this year, largely driven by much weaker revenue generation. The
deficit consolidation over the next three years is expected to be
gradual.
