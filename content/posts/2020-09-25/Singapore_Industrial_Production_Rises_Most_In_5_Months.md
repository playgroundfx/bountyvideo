Singapore industrial production grew at the fastest pace in five months
in August driven by strong expansion in electronics output, data from
the Economic Development Board showed Friday.

Industrial output grew 13.7 percent on a yearly basis in August,
reversing a 7.6 percent fall in July. Economists had forecast an annual
growth of 4.6 percent.

This was the first growth in four months and marked the fastest
expansion since March.

Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output grew 15.3 percent from last
year.

On a monthly basis, industrial production growth accelerated to 13.9
percent from 2.3 percent a month ago. Output was expected to advance 2.6
percent.

Data showed that all expect the transport engineering and general
manufacturing industries clusters registered annual growth in August.

Electronics output advanced 44.2 percent and precision engineering
output climbed 9.4 percent. Production of biomedical manufacturing grew
8.4 percent and that of chemicals gained 3.1 percent.

Meanwhile, output of general manufacturing and transport engineering
declined 18.6 percent and 36 percent, respectively.
