The UK budget deficit widened to the highest on record in the financial
year-to-date period reflecting the impact of the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic on the public finances, with the furlough schemes alone adding
GBP 56.0 billion to borrowing as subsidies paid by the central
government.

Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that during April to
August, public sector net borrowing was estimated to have been GBP 173.7
billion, which was GBP 146.9 billion more than in the same period last
year and the highest borrowing in any April to August period since
records began in 1993.

In August alone, public sector net borrowing excluding public sector
banks, increased by GBP 30.5 billion from last year to GBP 35.9 billion
in August.

This was slightly above economists' forecast of GBP 35.05 billion and
the highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993.

In August, receipts fell 14.3 percent annually, while expenditure
including job furlough schemes and social benefits surged 34.7 percent.

Public sector net debt excluding public sector banks at the end of
August 2020 was GBP 2,023.9 billion or around 101.9 percent of gross
domestic product.

The extra funding required to support the government's coronavirus
relief schemes combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross
domestic product have pushed the public sector net debt, the ONS said.

The Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Thursday unveiled a new Job Support Scheme
and measures to support businesses over months ahead.

With the recovery stuttering and no sign of concern in the gilt market,
the government is right to have refocussed on supporting the
[economy][2] rather than raising taxes, Andrew Wishart, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.
