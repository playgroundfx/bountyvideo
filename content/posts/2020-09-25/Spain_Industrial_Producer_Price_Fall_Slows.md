month in August, preliminary data from the statistical office INE showed
on Friday.  
  
The industrial producer price index decreased 3.5 percent year-on-year
after a 4.8 percent fall in July.

The pace of decline has slowed in every month since the 8.8 percent
slump in May.  
  
Excluding energy, producer prices decreased 0.4 percent year-on-year
following a 0.5 percent fall in the previous month.  
  
On a month-on-month basis, producer prices dropped 0.2 percent in August
after a 1.8 percent increase in July. The fall was the first in three
months.
