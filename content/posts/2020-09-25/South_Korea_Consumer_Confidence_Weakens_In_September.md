South Korea's consumer confidence weakened in September for the first
time in four months, survey data from the Bank of Korea showed on
Friday.

The composite consumer confidence index fell to 79.4 from 84.2 in
August. The index had risen in each month after falling to a low of 7.8
in May.

Consumers' assessment of the current and future living standards, income
and spending deteriorated.

Their perceptions regarding the current and future domestic economic
conditions, savings, and employment opportunities also weakened.
