After reporting sharp increases in new orders for U.S. manufactured
durable goods over the past few months, the Commerce Department released
a report on Friday showing durable goods orders climbed much less than
expected in the month of August.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose by 0.4 percent in
August after soaring by an upwardly revised 11.7 percent in July.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to surge up by 1.5 percent
compared to the 11.4 percent spike that had been reported for the
previous month.

Excluding a 0.5 percent increase in orders for transportation equipment,
durable goods orders still climbed by 0.4 percent in August following a
3.2 jump in July. Ex-transportation orders were expected to shoot up by
1.5 percent.

The uptick in durable goods orders partly reflected notable increases in
orders for machinery, primary metals and computers and electronic
products.

The growth was partly offset by significant declines in orders for
fabricated metal products and electrical equipment, appliances and
components.

Meanwhile, the report said orders for non-defense capital goods
excluding aircraft, a reading on [business][1] spending, advanced by 1.8
percent in August after jumping by an upwardly revised 2.5 percent in
July.

Shipments in the same category, which is the source data for equipment
investment in GDP, increased by 1.5 percent in August after surging up
by 2.8 percent in July.

Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said
shipments remain on course to rebound by more than 30 percent annualized
over the third quarter as a whole.

"That suggests that, after falling by 35.9% annualized in the second
quarter, business equipment investment will also rebound by more than
30% in the third," Hunter said.

He added, "Although other sectors of the [economy][2] are clearly still
struggling, this confirms that the overall hit to equipment investment
from the pandemic has been far smaller than during the financial
crisis."
