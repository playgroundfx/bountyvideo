The UK budget deficit widened to the highest on record in August due to
lower income and government's [coronavirus][1] relief schemes.

Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks, increased by
GBP 30.5 billion from last year to GBP 35.9 billion in August, data from
the Office for National Statistics showed Friday.

This was slightly was above economists' forecast of GBP 35.05 billion.
This was the highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993.

During April to August, borrowing was estimated to have been GBP 173.7
billion, which was GBP 146.9 billion more than in the same period last
year and the highest borrowing in any April to August period since
records began in 1993.

Public sector net debt excluding public sector banks at the end of
August 2020 was GBP 2,023.9 billion or around 101.9 percent of gross
domestic product.

The extra funding required to support the government's coronavirus
relief schemes combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross
domestic product have pushed the public sector net debt, the ONS said.
