The Dutch manufacturing expansion improved slightly in September, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The NEVI manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 52.5
in September from 52.3 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

Output rose sharply for nearly two years in September and new orders
increased. New orders from abroad also increased during the month.

Backlogs of work declined in September, with the rate of decline being
the softest in the six-month sequence. Job rate decreased for the
seventh straight month, with the rate of job shedding weaker than
pandemic in the second quarter.

Purchasing activity also rose at a softer rate in September.

On the price front, cost burden increased in September and selling
prices rose modestly.

The 12-month outlook for output remained positive in September and the
level of positive sentiment moderated slightly from August.

"The Netherlands is currently facing a much-feared 'second wave' of
[coronavirus][1] infections," Albert Jan Swart, manufacturing sector
economist at ABN AMRO, said.

"During the first wave of the pandemic, automotive assembly plants in
Germany and other European countries closed down because of a lack of
key parts from Chinese suppliers, causing an unprecedented fall of
export orders for Dutch firms," the economist said.
