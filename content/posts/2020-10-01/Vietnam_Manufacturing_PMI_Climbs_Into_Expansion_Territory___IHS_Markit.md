The manufacturing sector in Vietnam moved into expansion in September,
the latest survey from IHS Markit showed on Thursday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 52.2.

That's up from 45.7 in August, and it moves above the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates from expansion.

Individually, output and new orders expanded, while [business][1]
confidence hit a 14-month high - although employment continued to fall.

Rising new orders encouraged manufacturers to expand their purchasing
activity for the first time in three months, and at a solid pace.
