Ireland's manufacturing sector stagnated in September, survey data from
IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The seasonally adjusted AIB factory Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
fell to 50.0 in September from 52.3 in August.

Any reading showing 50.0 indicates no change in the sector.

In the third quarter, the manufacturing PMI was 53.2. This was the
highest since the first quarter of 2019, when the reading was 53.2.

New orders and output deteriorated in September, while employment and
stocks of purchases remained in contraction.

Suppliers' delivery times lengthened in September.

The volume of new work declined in September and firms reported weak
demand due to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic and Brexit.

New export orders declined for the first time in four months in
September and backlogs of work fell at a faster rate.

The number of workforce were reduced for the ninth time in eleven months
in September, due to weaker sales, cost cutting, non-replacement of
leavers and students returning to education.

Purchasing of new inputs were reduced in September, resulting in sharp
fall in stocks of raw material.

Input cost inflation was the strongest since April 2019 and output
prices declined in September.

The 12-month outlook remained positive in September, though it was the
lowest in four months.

"The main factor behind this, which is clear from the survey data, is
weakening demand as a result of the second wave to Covid-19 and
associated increased restrictions on activity," Oliver Mangan, AIB chief
economist, said.

"Brexit and the stalled UK-EU trade talks are also cited as another
source of growing uncertainty," Mangan added.
