Switzerland's consumer prices declined further in September and retail
sales grew, data from the Federal Statistical Office showed on Thursday.

September, following a 0.9 percent fall in August. Economists had
expected a 0.7 percent fall.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices remained unchanged in August. This
was in line with economists' expectation.

Prices for international package holidays and hotel accommodation
declined in September. Meanwhile, prices for clothing and footwear, and
other fruits increased.

The core CPI fell 0.3 percent annually in September and remained
unchanged from the previous month.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices fell 0.1 percent
monthly in September and declined 1.1 percent from the previous year.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the retail sales
grew a working-day adjusted 2.5 percent year-on-year in August.

Sales of food, beverages and tobacco gained 8.1 percent yearly in
August, while non-food sector sales fell 0.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, seasonally adjusted retail sales fell 1.9 percent in
August.

decreased 2.1 percent from a month ago.

Elsewhere, survey data revealed that the procure.ch Swiss manufacturing

expected a reading of 54.0.

Any reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.
