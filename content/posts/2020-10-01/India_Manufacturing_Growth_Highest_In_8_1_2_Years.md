India's manufacturing activity rose to the highest in over eight-
and-a-half years in September on robust demand, survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Thursday.

The headline IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or
PMI, rose to 56.8 in September from 52.0 in August. Economists had
expected a modest improvement to 52.8. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

New [business][1] inflows increased in September, with the rate of
expansion fastest since early-2012.

Total sales increased with the renewed expansion in new export orders in
September.

Employment decreased for the sixth consecutive month and backlogs of
work increased.

Purchasing activity increased due to greater production requirements in
September. Input buying was the strongest in over eight-and-a-half
years.

Inputs holding increased for the first time in six months in September
and inventories of finished goods fell at a sharper rate.

On the price front, input costs rose at a softer pace in September and
output charges broadly stabilized after falling for five months.

In the 12-months outlook, nearly one-third of the manufacturers expect
the output to grow, resulting in the strongest degree of overall
optimism in over four years.

"The Indian manufacturing industry continued to move in the right
direction, with PMI data for September highlighting many positives,"
Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.

"Due to loosened COVID-19 restrictions, factories went full steam ahead
for production, supported by a surge in new work," the economist said.
