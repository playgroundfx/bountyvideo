The manufacturing sector in Myanmar fell sharply into contraction in
September, the latest survey from IHS Markit showed on Thursday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 35.9.

That's down sharply from 53.2 in August, and it falls well beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates from expansion.

Output and new orders fell at rapid rates due to new lockdown measures,
sending the index to its second-lowest score on record.

There was a marked reduction in the workforce as many factories closed
temporarily.
