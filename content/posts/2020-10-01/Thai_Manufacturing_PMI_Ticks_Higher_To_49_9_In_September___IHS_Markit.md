The manufacturing sector in Thailand continued to contract in September,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit showed on
Thursday with a manufacturing PMI score of 47.7.

That's up from 47.3 in August, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates from expansion.

Individually, production expanded amid improving domestic demand, while
there was backlog accumulation for the first time since January. Export
sales fell at a slower pace.

Further order book growth was accompanied by increased production
volumes.
