Greece's consumer prices were unchanged from a year ago in March, while
they rose from the previous month, figures from the Hellenic Statistical
Authority showed on Friday.  
  
The consumer price index remained unchanged from the same month last
year, after a 0.2 percent increase in February.

On a month-on-month basis, the CPI climbed 1.6 percent in March after a
0.5 percent fall in the previous month. It was the first increase in
three months.  
  
The monthly increase was driven by a 44.4 percent surge in prices in the
Clothing and footwear group, due to the recovery of prices up to normal
levels before the winter sales period, the agency said.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, which is meant for EU
comparison, climbed 0.2 percent year-on-year after a 0.4 percent
increase in the previous month. That was the weakest inflation rate in
five months.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the HICP rose 1.2 percent in March after
a 0.4 percent fall in February. That was the first increase in three
months.
