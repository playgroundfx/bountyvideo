The Netherlands' goods exports grew at a slower pace for a second
consecutive month in February, while imports declined for the first time
in four years, figures from the Dutch statistical office CBS showed on
Friday.

Merchandise exports rose 3.3 percent year-on-year following a 3.9
percent increase in January. In December, exports grew 4.6 percent.  
  
Export growth in February was largely underpinned by shipments of
machinery and petroleum products.  
  
Imports decreased 0.9 percent from a year ago, mainly due to lesser
demand for minerals, petroleum products, metal products and machines.

The adverse effects of the [coronavirus][1] outbreak are barely visible
in the February data, the agency said.  
  
The statistical office said conditions for exports in April are less
favorable than in February, mainly because German and European producer
confidence was lower amid the spread of the coronavirus or Covid-19, and
the development of the real exchange rate was less favorable.
