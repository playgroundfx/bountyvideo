Producer prices in Japan were down 0.9 percent on month in March, the
Bank of Japan said on Friday.

That was shy of expectations for a decline of 0.7 percent following the
0.4 percent drop in February.

On a yearly basis, producer prices fell 0.4 percent - again missing
expectations for a dip of 0.1 percent after climbing 0.8 percent in the
previous month.

Export prices were down 2.3 percent on month and 5.1 percent on year,
the bank said, while import prices sank 4.7 percent on month and 7.7
percent on year.
