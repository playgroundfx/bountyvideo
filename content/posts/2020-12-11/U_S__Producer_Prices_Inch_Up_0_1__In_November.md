according to a report released by the Labor Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
inched up by 0.1 percent in November after climbing by 0.3 percent in
October. Economists had expected producer prices to rise by 0.2 percent.

Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices still crept up by
0.1 percent in November, matching the uptick seen in October. Core
prices were also expected to increase by 0.2 percent.
