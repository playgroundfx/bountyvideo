in the mining sector, data from the Department of Statistics showed on
Friday.

Industrial production fell 0.5 percent year-on-year in October, after a

expectations.

by 10.6 percent, while electricity output rose 1.0 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production climbed 1.7 percent in
October.

increased in October after decreasing for four straight months since
June. The rate rose marginally to 4.7 percent in October from 4.6
percent in September.
