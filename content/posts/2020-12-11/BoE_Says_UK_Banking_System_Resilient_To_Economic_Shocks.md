The UK banking system is resilient to a wide range of possible economic
outcomes, the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England said
Friday.

The FPC said the banking system has the capacity to continue to support
households and businesses even if economic outcomes are considerably
worse than currently expected.

The report was released after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there is
strong possibility that the UK will fail to strike a trade deal with the
EU.

The FPC expects countercyclical capital buffer rate to remain at zero
percent until at least the fourth quarter of 2021.

The FPC viewed that the eventual pace of return to a standard 2 percent
CCyB rate will depend on banks' ability to rebuild capital while
continuing to support households and businesses.

Financial sector preparations for the end of the transition period with
the EU are now in their final stages.

According to FPC, the financial sector is prepared to limit disruption
to financial services. Most risks to financial stability that could
arise from disruption to the provision of cross-border financial
services at the end of the transition period have been mitigated, the
bank added.
