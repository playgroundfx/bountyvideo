Consumer sentiment has unexpectedly improved in the month of December,
according to a preliminary report released by the University of Michigan
on Friday.

The report said the consumer sentiment index climbed to 81.4 in December
from 76.9 in November. The increase surprised economists, who had
expected the index to edge down to 76.5.

Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin said the unexpected
improvement in consumer sentiment was due to a partisan shift in
economic prospects.

"Following Biden's election, Democrats became much more optimistic, and
Republicans much more pessimistic, the opposite of the partisan shift
that occurred when Trump was elected," said Curtin.

He added, "As has been documented in the past four years, self-
identified Independents adopted more balanced views, maintaining their
economic expectations in December at the same unfavorable levels as when
the covid crisis began nine months ago."

Curtin called it "surprising" that the recent resurgence in
[coronavirus][1] infections and deaths was overwhelmed by partisanship.

The report also said the current economic conditions index rose to 91.8
in December from 87.0 in November, while the index of consumer
expectations climbed to 74.7 from 70.5.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations slumped to 2.3
percent in December from 2.8 percent in November. Five-year inflation
expectations were unchanged at 2.5 percent.
