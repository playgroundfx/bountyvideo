S&P Global Ratings downgraded Sri Lanka's sovereign ratings on Friday,
as country's fiscal position is expected to deteriorate over coming
years.

The sovereign rating was lowered to 'CCC+' from 'B-'. The ratings are
well below the investment grade. The outlook was stable.

According to S&P, risks to debt servicing capacity have risen, as the
government's access to external financing has become increasingly
dependent on favorable [business][1], economic, and financial
conditions.

The Covid-19 has significantly narrowed the government's fiscal space
and its ability to generate earnings.

High fiscal deficits and excessive domestic liquidity will put downward
pressure on the exchange rate and worsen the risks associated with the
government's already-high debt burden, S&P said.

The [economy][2] is forecast to contract sharply by 5.3 percent in 2020
largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, real GDP growth is
expected to accelerate to 4.3 percent in 2021, albeit from a low base,
and average 4.5 percent in 2021-2023.
