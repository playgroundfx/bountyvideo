China's factory gate prices increased at the fastest pace on record in
September driven by the surge in coal prices and power rationing,
official data revealed on Thursday. Nonetheless, consumer price
inflation slowed unexpectedly on falling pork prices.

Producer price inflation rose more-than-expected to 10.7 percent in
September from 9.5 percent in August, the National Bureau of Statistics
reported. The rate was forecast to rise to 10.5 percent.

Meanwhile, consumer price inflation eased marginally to 0.7 percent in
September from 0.8 percent a month ago. The expected rate was 0.9
percent.  
  
Pork prices, the main component of consumer prices, plunged 46.9 percent
annually. Food prices slid 5.2 percent, while non-food prices were up 2
percent.

Core consumer price inflation that excludes food and energy, held steady
at 1.2 percent in September.

There are few signs that the rise in producer price inflation is feeding
through to higher output prices of consumer goods, Sheana Yue and Julian
Evans-Pritchard, economists at Capital Economics, said.

The overall inflation outlook remains benign, with PPI inflation likely
to drop back around the turn of the year and CPI inflation set to remain
muted for the foreseeable future, the economist added.
