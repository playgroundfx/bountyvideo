Singapore central bank unexpectedly tightened its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) on
Thursday as the [economy][1] is expected to sustain strong growth
underpinned by foreign demand and domestic spending.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore decided to raise slightly the slope
of the S$NEER [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) band, from zero percent previously. The width of
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) band and the level at which it is centered will be unchanged.

The bank said the decision will help to ensure price stability over the
medium term while recognizing the risks to the economic recovery.

The MAS applies the exchange rate against a basket of currencies within
an undisclosed band as its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tool.

The central bank forecast the city-state economy to expand 6-7 percent
this year and register a slower but still-above trend pace in 2022.

According to the data published by the Ministry of Trade and Industry,
the economy grew 6.5 percent on a year-on-year basis in the third
quarter, moderating from the 15.2 percent growth in the previous
quarter.

Strengthening external demand and recovering domestic expenditure are
expected to sustain a firm pace of growth in the Singapore economy in
the quarters ahead, the bank said.

For 2021 as a whole, the bank expects core inflation to come in near the
upper end of the 0-1 percent forecast range, and is expected to increase
further to 1-2 percent in 2022.

Consumer price inflation is likely to come in around 2 percent in 2021
and average 1.5-2.5 percent next year.

Core inflation is unlikely to rise substantially next year, even as the
recovery regains some momentum, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. As such, the MAS is likely to leave [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) on hold in
2022.
