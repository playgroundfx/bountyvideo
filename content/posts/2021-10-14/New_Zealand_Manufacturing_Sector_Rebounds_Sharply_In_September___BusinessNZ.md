The manufacturing sector in New Zealand bounced back into expansion
territory in September, the latest survey from BusinessNZ showed on
Friday with a seasonally adjusted Performance of Manufacturing Index
score of 51.4.

That's up from 40.1 in August and it moves back above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Among the individual components, employment (54.5), new orders (54.3)
and finished stocks (50.1) were in expansion, while deliveries (47.8)
and production (49.9) remained in contraction.

"The rebound the PMI experienced in September was encouraging, although
the survey is not without some still-frayed parts," said BNZ Senior
Economist Craig Ebert. "Credit where it's due though, as the NZ PMI
traced much less of a contraction, and quicker stabilization, compared
to what it went through during the initial outbreak of COVID-19."
