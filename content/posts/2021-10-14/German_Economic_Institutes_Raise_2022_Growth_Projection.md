Germany's top economic institutes upgraded economic growth projection
for 2022 but lowered its projection for the current year citing supply
bottlenecks in the manufacturing sector.

According to the economic forecast Autumn 2021, jointly prepared by the
Ifo in Munich, the RWI in Essen, the DIW in Berlin, the IfW in Kiel and
Halle's IWH, gross domestic product will grow 2.4 percent this year
instead of 3.7 percent estimated in April.

The projection for 2022 was revised up to 4.8 percent from 3.9 percent.
For 2023, growth is seen at 1.9 percent.  
  
Private consumption is likely to return to normal over the course of the
coming year. Manufacturing output will also increase again as supply
bottlenecks ease, the institutes noted.

As the recovery continues, employment will continue to rise. The
unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.7 percent this year and 5.3
percent next year.

Inflation is projected to remain elevated for the time being. The
institutes forecast consumer prices to rise by 2.5 percent in 2022 and
1.7 percent in 2023, after 3 percent in the current year.

Elsewhere, the [economy][1] ministry said the economic development is
likely to run sideways in the fourth quarter. The ministry expects
industrial output to remain subdued in the months ahead.

Although the outlook for industrial activity deteriorated somewhat, the
ministry said it remains cautiously optimistic.
