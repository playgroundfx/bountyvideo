Ireland's construction activity increased in August, albeit at a softer
pace, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 57.5 in
August from 62.8 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in
the sector.

Among the three categories, housing and commercial activity increased in
August, albeit at a softer pace. Meanwhile, civil engineering activity
contracted.

"The May to July period was the second strongest three-month period for
overall activity in the survey's twenty-one-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and while the
August results were not quite as exceptional, they do nonetheless
clearly point to a sector that is enjoying strong growth as it continues
to benefit from the re-opening of the [economy][1] which has been
facilitated by the easing of public health restrictions," Simon Barry,
Chief Economist Republic of Ireland at Ulster Bank, said.

New orders increased for the fifth straight month in August and staffing
level continued to rise.

Purchasing activity increased in August, despite easing to a four-month
low. Suppliers' delivery time lengthened.

Input cost increased sharply in August and the rate of inflation eased
from July's record high.

Firms remained confident that [business][2] activity rise for the next
12 months.
