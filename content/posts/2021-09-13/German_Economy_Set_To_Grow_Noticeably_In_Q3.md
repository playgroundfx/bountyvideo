The German [economy][1] is set to log a noticeable growth in the third
quarter before normalizing in the fourth quarter, the economy ministry
said on Monday.

However, the further spread of the new [coronavirus][2] mutations and
their influence on the infection process could cloud the outlook, the
ministry said in its monthly report.

According to official estimate, the largest euro area economy recovered
in the second quarter, with economic output rising 1.6 percent.

The government observed that the mechanical engineering and automotive
industries, which were recently slowed by semiconductor shortages, were
able to increase their output.

Given this expansion as well as high order situation, the outlook for
the industrial economy remains cautiously optimistic, the ministry
added.

On price front, the ministry said inflation increased significantly
since the start of the year due to special factors. Nonetheless,
inflation will fall significantly early next year after the special
effects fade.  
  
The government observed a remarkable recovery in the labor market. The
ministry expects short-time working to decline further in the coming
months.
