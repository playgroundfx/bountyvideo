percent increase in the previous month.

Compared to the previous month, the CPI rose 0.25 percent, while the
CFPI decreased 0.12 percent.

Among the main components, the biggest annual increase of 12.95 percent
was registered for the fuel and light group. Food and beverages prices
rose 3.80 percent.
