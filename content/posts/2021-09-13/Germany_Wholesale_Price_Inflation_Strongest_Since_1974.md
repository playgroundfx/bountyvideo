Germany wholesale prices grew at the fastest pace since 1974 in August
amid sharp increases in raw material and intermediate product prices,
Destatis reported Monday.  
  
Wholesale prices increased 12.3 percent on a yearly basis, following
July's 11.3 percent in July.

This was the strongest growth since October 1974, when prices were up
13.2 percent in the wake of the first oil crisis.

On a monthly basis, wholesale price inflation slowed to 0.5 percent in
August from 1.1 percent in July.

There was a sharp increase in wholesale prices of many raw materials and
intermediate products. Destatis also cited the very low base in the
previous months in connection with the Corona crisis as the reason for
higher wholesale price inflation.

Wholesale prices of ores, metals and metal semi-finished products surged
63.4 percent annually in August. Solid fuels and mineral oil product
prices were up 35.5 percent.
