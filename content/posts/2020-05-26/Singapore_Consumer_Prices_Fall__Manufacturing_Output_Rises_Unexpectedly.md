Singapore's consumer prices declined in April, while manufacturing
output grew unexpectedly, driven by a surge in biomedical cluster, data
showed on Tuesday.

The consumer price index fell 0.7 percent year-on-year in April, after
remaining unchanged in March, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and
the Ministry of Trade and Industry revealed. Economists had expected a
0.4 percent fall.

This fall in the CPI was largely due to steeper declines in the costs of
services and retail & other goods.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.3 percent in April, following a 0.2 percent decline in
the preceding month.

The latest decline in core inflation was mainly driven by the decrease
in the cost of private transport, services, and retail and other goods.

The statistical office expects external sources of inflation to remain
benign in the coming quarters, amid weak global demand condition. Oil
prices would remain low and will weigh on the prices of energy-related
components.

Supply chain disruptions caused by Covid-19 could increase the prices on
imported food prices.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average between -1 percent and 0 percent in 2020, the statistical office
and MAS said.

Manufacturing output increased 13.0 percent annually in April, slower
than 16.5 percent growth in March, the Economic Development Board
revealed. Economists had expected a 0.6 percent fall.

Excluding biomedical manufacturing, industrial output fell 3.5 percent
yearly in April, after remaining unchanged in the prior month.

Among clusters, biomedical manufacturing grew a robust 100.5 percent
annually in April. Precision engineering output expanded 5.9 percent and
electronics production rose 0.8 percent.

Meanwhile, transport engineering declined 24.1 percent. General
manufacturing and chemicals decreased 20.2 percent and 6.8 percent,
respectively.

On a monthly basis, industrial production rose 3.6 percent in April,
following a 21.7 percent increase in the prior month.
