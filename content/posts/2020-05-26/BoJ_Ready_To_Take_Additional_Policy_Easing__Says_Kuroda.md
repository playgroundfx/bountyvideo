The Bank of Japan will not hesitate to take additional easing measures
if required as the novel [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, depressed global
activity, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday.

Japan's [economy][2] has been in an increasingly severe situation due to
the impact of the spread of Covid-19 at home and abroad, Kuroda said in
a semi-annual testimony to parliament.

As the impact of the spread wanes, Japan's economy is likely to improve.
The annual rate of change in consumer prices is expected to increase
gradually, he added.

However, the outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely
unclear, he said.

The BoJ last week introduced a new lending program worth about JPY 30
trillion to help financing small and medium-sized firms struggling to
operate.
