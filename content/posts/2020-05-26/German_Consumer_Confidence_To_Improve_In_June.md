German consumer confidence is set to recover marginally in June, survey
results from the market research group GfK showed Tuesday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index rose to -18.9 in June from
-23.1 in May. The score was expected to improve to -18.3.

Among components of the indicator, economic and income expectations, as
well as propensity to buy, all logged a slight increase.

"The gradual opening of many businesses has certainly contributed to the
propensity to consume not having to take any further hits, and increases
even slightly at the present time," Rolf BÃ¼rkl, GfK consumer expert,
said.

The economic expectations index increased 11 points to -10.4 in May. The
income expectations index rose 13.6 points to -5.7. At the same time,
the indicator for propensity to buy gained 10.1 points to 5.5 in May.
