With concerns about the outlook for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) weighing on Wall
Street on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve has released the minutes of its
March meeting.

The minutes showed that the meeting featured a continued discussion
about reducing the size of the Fed's balance sheet, which has swelled to
about $9 trillion due to the central bank's recently concluded asset
purchase program.

Staff presented a range of possible [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) for reducing the Fed's
securities holdings over time in a predictable manner, with all of the
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) featuring a more rapid pace of balance sheet runoff than in
2017-2019.

The Fed said participants generally agreed reducing the central bank's
holdings by about $95 billion per month would likely be appropriate,
reflecting monthly caps of about $60 billion for Treasury securities and
about $35 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.

The minutes showed that there was also general agreement that the caps
could be phased in over a period of three months or modestly longer if
market conditions warrant.

Participants agreed reducing the size of the Fed's balance sheet would
play an important role in firming the stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and that
the process could begin as soon as the next meeting in May.

Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, noted the
balance sheet reduction outlined in the minutes is double the pace of
the run-off between 2017 and 2019 but said it is still a "little smaller
than we were expecting, particularly in light of the more hawkish post-
meeting comments from various officials."

At the March meeting, the Fed announced its widely expected decision to
raise interest by 25 basis points to a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent,
marking the first rate hike since December 2018.

The minutes showed many participants would have preferred a 50 basis
point increase due to rate of inflation being well above the Fed's
objective and facing risks to the upside.

However, a number of these participants felt a 25 basis point increase
would be appropriate in light of the greater near-term uncertainty
associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Many participants noted that one or more 50 basis point increases could
be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures
remained elevated or intensified, the Fed said.

The Fed's next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting scheduled for May 3-4, with CME
Group's FedWatch Tool currently indicating a 78.8 percent chance of a 50
basis point rate hike.
