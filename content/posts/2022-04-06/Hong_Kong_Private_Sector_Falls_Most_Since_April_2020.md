Hong Kong's private sector contracted at a sharper pace in March amid
lingering COVID-19 disruptions, survey results from S&P Global showed on
Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index posted below the 50.0 neutral threshold
at 42.0 in March, down from 42.9 in February.  
  
The sector shrank for the third straight month with the latest fall the
fastest since April 2020.

New orders and output in Hong Kong both declined for a third consecutive
month. As a result of the fall in demand, purchasing activity eased in
March.

capacity in February.

Price pressures in the Hong Kong private sector also mounted in March
with overall input prices rising at the fastest rate since October 2011.
Further, overall sentiment in the private sector stayed pessimistic in
March.
