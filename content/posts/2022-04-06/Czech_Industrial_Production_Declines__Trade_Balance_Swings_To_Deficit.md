Industrial new orders increased 5.6 percent year-on-year in February,
but slower than the 7.0 percent rise in January.

February, the statistical office said in a separate report.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the construction output gained 4.8
percent monthly in February.

Another report from the Czech Statistical Office showed that the trade
balance registered a deficit of CZK 4.4 billion in February versus a
surplus of CZK 21.3 billion in the same month last year.
