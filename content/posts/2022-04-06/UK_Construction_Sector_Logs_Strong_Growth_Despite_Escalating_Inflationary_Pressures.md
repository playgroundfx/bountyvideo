Despite escalating inflationary pressures and concerns about the impact
of the war in Ukraine, the UK construction sector logged another robust
growth, survey results published by S&P Global showed on Wednesday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing
Managers' Index came in at 59.1 in March, unchanged from February. The
reading was forecast to fall to 57.8.

The latest score signaled the joint-fastest rate of output growth since
June 2021.  
Commercial work was the best-performing segment in March, with projects
restarting amid the roll back of pandemic restriction. In contrast, the
recoveries in civil engineering and residential work lost momentum in
March.

New orders grew at the strongest rate since August 2021. Rising
workloads contributed to a considerable rise in staffing numbers during
March.

Further, input buying rose at the steepest pace since July 2021, driven
by a combination of stronger demand and efforts to build stocks where
possible.

Imbalanced supply and demand, alongside escalating energy, fuel and
commodity prices, resulted in a rapid rise in average cost burdens in
March. The overall rate of input price inflation was the highest for six
months.

Due to the concerns about the war in Ukraine, confidence among
constructors reached the weakest since October 2020, the survey showed.
