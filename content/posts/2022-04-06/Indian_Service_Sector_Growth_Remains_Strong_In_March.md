India's service sector growth expanded at the strongest rate since
December last year, survey results from S&P Global showed on Wednesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.6 in March from 51.8
in February. Any score above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

In the fourth quarter, the reading was at its lowest average of 52.3
since the beginning of this fiscal year versus 57.4 in the third
quarter.

New work intakes increased further in March, while new [business][1]
from abroad continued to decline. New export orders contracted at the
fastest pace since September last year.

The overall rate of cost inflation was the strongest since March 2011
and the overall rate of charge inflation remained high, but moderated.

Business confidence weakened in March due to inflation expectations and
the overall level of sentiment remained subdued in the backdrop supply
concerns due to war in Ukraine.

The staffing levels remained unchanged in March and outstanding business
volumes increased. The rate of backlog accumulation increased slightly.

The composite output index that combines the performance of
manufacturing and services, rose to 54.3 in March from 53.5 in the
previous month. This was the strongest rate of expansion in 2022.

"The war in Ukraine exacerbated lingering issues in supply chains,
triggering a re-acceleration in inflation across the Indian service
[economy][2]," Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P
Global, said.
