The German construction sector registered a sharp slowdown in activity
growth in March as Ukraine war dampened demand, prices as well as
supply, survey results from S&P Global showed on Wednesday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 50.9 in March from a
two-year high of 54.9 in February. Nonethless, a score above 50.0
indicates expansion in the sector.

The slowdown was led by the residential sector, which after recording
strong growth in the prior two months, logged a renewed contraction.

Work on commercial building projects continued to increase, though the
pace of expansion eased considerably. At the same time, civil
engineering activity maintained the most momentum in March.
