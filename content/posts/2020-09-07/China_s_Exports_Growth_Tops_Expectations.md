China's exports grew more than expected in August mainly due to base
effects, while imports dropped unexpectedly from last year, data from
the General Administration of Customs showed Monday.

Exports grew 9.5 percent on a yearly basis in August, faster than the
expected increase of 7.1 percent.

At the same time, imports were down 2.1 percent annually, in contrast to
the expected rise of 0.1 percent. Imports had dropped 1.4 percent in
July.

As a result, the trade surplus totaled $58.9 billion versus the expected
level of $50.5 billion in August. However, the surplus declined from
July's $62.3 billion.

China's export data still looks good, Iris Pang, an ING economist said.
But there are risks of lower growth in the coming months, mainly from
the [technology][1] war.

Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said while
exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in global demand, the
forthcoming slowdown in shipments of Covid-19 related goods means that
further upside is probably limited.  
  
With credit growth still accelerating and infrastructure-led stimulus
still ramping up, import volumes should remain strong in the coming
months, Evans-Pritchard noted. Coupled with a further gradual recovery
in commodity prices, growth in import values should therefore return to
positive territory again before long.
