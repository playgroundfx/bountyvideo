After reporting a sharp increase in U.S. personal income in the previous
month, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing
personal income edged up by slightly less than expected in the month of
August.

The Commerce Department said personal spending crept up by 0.2 percent
in August after jumping by 1.1 percent in July. Economists had expected
income to rise by 0.3 percent.

Meanwhile, the report said personal spending climbed by 0.8 percent in
August following a revised 0.1 percent dip in July. Spending was
expected to increase by 0.6 percent compared to the 0.3 percent uptick
originally reported for the previous month.
