The manufacturing sector in Malaysia continued to contract in September,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Friday with a manufacturing PMI score of 48.1.

That's up from 43.4 in August and it remains beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Both output volumes and new order inflows continued to be scaled back in
September, though rates of decline both eased to the softest in four
months.

Manufacturers commonly reported that strict pandemic restrictions had
hampered production capacity and client demand. Foreign demand for
Malaysian manufactured goods also moderated, but at a softer pace than
total new orders.
