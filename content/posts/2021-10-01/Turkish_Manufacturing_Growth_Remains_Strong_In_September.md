Turkey's manufacturing activity increased at a softer pace in September,
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The headline Istanbul Chamber of Industry Turkey manufacturing
Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.5 in September from 54.1 in
August. Any reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

Business conditions accelerated for the fourth straight month in
September. New [business][1] increased with the rise in new export
orders.

Employment increased in September and backlogs of work rose for the
first time since July last year. Suppliers' delivery time lengthened.

Input costs increased sharply in September and selling prices rose
further.

"As part of efforts to guard against these problems, stocks of purchases
were raised to the greatest extent since the end of 2017," Andrew
Harker, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
