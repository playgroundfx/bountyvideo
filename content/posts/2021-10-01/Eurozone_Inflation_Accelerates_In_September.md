Eurozone inflation accelerated for the third straight month in
September, flash data from Eurostat showed on Friday.

Inflation advanced to 3.4 percent in September from 3.0 percent in
August. The rate was also above economists' forecast of 3.3 percent.

Core inflation that excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco,
increased to 1.9 percent from 1.6 percent in the previous month.

Overall consumer price growth was driven by the 17.4 percent increase in
energy prices. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices were up 2.1 percent and
non-energy industrial goods prices grew 2.1 percent. Prices of services
rose 1.7 percent.

On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices gained 0.5 percent in
September.
