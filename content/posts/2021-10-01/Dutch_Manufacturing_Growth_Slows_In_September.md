The Netherlands' manufacturing sector growth eased in September, but the
pace of expansion remained strong, survey results from IHS Markit showed
on Friday.

The NEVI manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, decreased to
62.0 in September from 65.8 in August. Any reading above 50.0 indicates
expansion in the sector.

Orders increased in September and the rate of new order growth was the
slowest since February.

Output and backlogs of work increased further in September. Suppliers'
delivery time lengthened.

Input price inflation eased to the lowest in five months and output
charge inflation accelerated in September.

The 12-month outlook for production remained positive in September.

"Moreover, the sector is struggling with record lead times and material
shortages, shortages of staff and high utilization of fixed capacity,"
Albert Jan Swart, Manufacturing Sector Economist at ABN AMRO, said.
