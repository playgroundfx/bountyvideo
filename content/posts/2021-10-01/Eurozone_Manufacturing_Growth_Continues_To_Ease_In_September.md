Eurozone manufacturing activity continued to ease in September as
supply-side constraints dampened production, survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Friday.  
  
The final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 58.6 in
September from 61.4 in August. This was the lowest since February and
below the 'flash' print of 58.7. The headline index logged its largest
fall since April 2020.

New orders and production signaled considerable moderations in growth.
New export orders rose at the slowest pace since January.

Supply constraints were a key hindrance to production schedules. Softer
demand conditions were also another contributing factor. Supply delivery
times continued to lengthen in September.

On the price front, the survey revealed that inflationary pressures
remained acute in September. To protect profit margins, manufacturers
lifted their output prices, and to a quicker extent than seen in August.

Manufacturing jobs growth slowed to a six-month low in September due to
lower labor requirements amid the widespread component shortages.

Finally, [business][1] confidence fractionally ticked higher. However,
the degree of optimism held close to August's nine-month low.

Among big-four economies, Germany registered the most notable slowdown
compared with August due to supply bottlenecks. The headline IHS
Markit/BME final manufacturing PMI came in at an eight-month low of 58.4
in September, down from 62.6 in August and the flash score of 58.5.

France manufacturing activity growth eased in September as shipping
delays and surging prices weighed on production and new orders. The
final factory PMI fell to 55.0 from 57.5 in August. The flash reading
was 55.2.

Italy's manufacturing upturn remained strong in September. Nonetheless,
the pace of expansion was the slowest since February. The factory PMI
slid to 59.7 from 60.9 in August.

Spain's manufacturing sector continued to grow in September but at a
slower pace. The factory PMI dropped to 58.1 from 59.5 in the prior
month. The score was forecast to fall to 58.2.
