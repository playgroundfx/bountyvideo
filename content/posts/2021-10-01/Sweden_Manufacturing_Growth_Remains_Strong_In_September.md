Sweden's manufacturing expansion slowed in September, yet remained
robust, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF
showed on Friday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector rose to 64.6
in September from 60.1 in August.

A PMI reading above 50 suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

"The downward trend in PMI totals indicates that expansion in the
industry has slowed down in recent months, while supply shortages and
supply disruptions have become an increasing challenge for the
industry," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-indexes, order intake and production increased in
September. Employment and delivery time rose, while inventories
declined.

Suppliers' raw material and intermediate goods prices increased in
September. Cost pressure increased and included more product groups.
