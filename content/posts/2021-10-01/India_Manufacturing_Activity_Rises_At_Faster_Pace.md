India's manufacturing sector logged a faster growth in September, as
companies benefited from strengthening demand conditions amid the easing
of COVID-19 restrictions, survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Friday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.7 in September
from 52.3 in August. A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion.

Underpinned by faster growth in new orders, manufacturers ramped up
production in September. Data showed that global demand for Indian goods
strengthened in September.

To accommodate for rising sales and progress with production schedules,
companies purchased additional raw materials.

Companies forecast further growth of sales as pandemic-related
restrictions continue to ease. Employment remained unchanged in
September.

Rising fuel, raw material and transportation prices pushed the overall
rate of input cost inflation to a five-month high. Meanwhile, output
prices increased at a slower rate.
