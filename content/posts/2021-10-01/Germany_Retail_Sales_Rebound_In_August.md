Germany's retail sales rebounded in August but at a slower-than-expected
pace, data published by Destatis showed on Friday.

Retail sales grew 1.1 percent month-on-month in August, reversing a 4.5
percent fall in July. Economists had forecast a monthly growth of 1.5
percent.

On a yearly basis, retail sales growth held steady at 0.4 percent in
August. This was much slower than the expected growth of 1.9 percent.

Sales of food, beverages and tobacco were down 6.6 percent, while non-
food product sales advanced 4.9 percent.

Retail turnover was up by 6.0 percent on the pre-crisis month of
February 2020.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales increased 1.2 percent on month and
advanced 2.4 percent annually in August.
