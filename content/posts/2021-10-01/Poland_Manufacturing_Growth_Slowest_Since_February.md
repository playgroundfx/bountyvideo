Poland's manufacturing sector growth eased for the third month in a row
in September, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, fell to 53.5 in
September from 56 in August. The latest index reading was the lowest
level since February.

Economists had forecast a score of 54.5. A PMI reading above 50 suggests
growth in the manufacturing sector.

Growth in both production and new orders eased in September. Suppliers'
delivery time lengthened.

On the price front, input price inflation and output prices increased in
September.

Employment increased marginally in September and backlogs of works rose
further.

The overall sentiment eased to the lowest in five months in September.
Firms expected a rise in output from present 12 months' time, with the
hope for an end to the pandemic.

"Poland's manufacturers reported that client demand growth has softened
and hinted at the possibility of the sector heading towards a period of
dreaded stagflation," Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit,
said.
