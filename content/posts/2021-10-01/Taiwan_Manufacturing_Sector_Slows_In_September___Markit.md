The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to expand in September,
albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Friday with a manufacturing PMI score of 54.7.

That's down from 58.5 in August although it remains well above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Taiwanese goods producers noted a much softer rise in overall new work
at the end of the third quarter. Notably, the rate of increase was the
weakest recorded for 14 months and only mild. The pandemic was
reportedly a key factor weighing on sales. New export [business][1] also
expanded at a slower pace, though the upturn was nonetheless sharp
overall.

In line with the trend for total new work, production increased only
modestly in September, with the rate of growth also slipping to a
14-month low. Companies commented that raw material shortages and
supplier delays had also limited production.
