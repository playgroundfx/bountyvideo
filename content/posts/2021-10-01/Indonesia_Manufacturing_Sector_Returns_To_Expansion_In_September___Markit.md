The manufacturing sector in Indonesia swung into expansion territory in
September, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Friday with
a manufacturing PMI score of 52.2.

That's up from 43.7 in August and it moves above the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Latest PMI data showed that both output and new orders returned to
growth in September after two months of steep contraction. Survey
respondents highlighted that demand had revived as the COVID-19
situation improved, while the easing of mobility restrictions in some
areas helped to boost activity as well.

Foreign demand remained weak in September, however, with COVID-19
disruptions and shipping difficulties continuing to affect export
orders.
