Ireland's construction sector growth improved in October, survey results
from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank Construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.9 in
October from 56.3 in September. A score above 50.0 indicates expansion.

The overall growth was driven by commercial activity. Meanwhile, housing
activity growth eased and civil engineering activity declined at a
softer pace.

New [business][1] increased in October and staffing level expanded. The
rate of purchasing activity eased to the lowest in six months.

The sentiment regarding the 12-month outlook improved in October.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in October. Input price inflation
rose to record high in October.

"Having eased over the summer months following the post-lockdown snap
back in activity in Q2, the headline PMI rose slightly last month,
signalling a modest re-acceleration in the pace of overall construction
activity growth at the beginning of the fourth quarter," Simon Barry,
chief economist Republic of Ireland at Ulster Bank, said.
