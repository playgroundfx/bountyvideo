South Korea's gross domestic product expanded an annualized 4.1 percent
on year in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Bank of Korea said on
Tuesday.

That beat forecasts for an increase of 3.7 percent on year and was up
from 4.0 percent in the previous three months.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP rose 1.1 percent - again
exceeding expectations for 0.9 percent and accelerating from 0.3 percent
in the third quarter.

For all of 2021, gross domestic product expanded 4.0 percent.
