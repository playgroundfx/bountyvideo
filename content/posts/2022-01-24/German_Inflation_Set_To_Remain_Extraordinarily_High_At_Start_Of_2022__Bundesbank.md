Germany's harmonized inflation is likely to remain exceptionally high at
the start of this year, Bundesbank said Monday.

In its monthly report, the bank said the special impact of the
introduction of the climate package, the recovery in crude oil prices
and the reversal of the temporary reduction in VAT rates drove inflation
higher last year.

Further, non-energy services and industrial goods rose sharply at times
over the course of the year, mainly due to the supply bottlenecks and
price increases to compensate for previously suffered profit losses.

"Since these factors are also having an effect into the new year, the
rate at the beginning of 2022 is likely to remain extraordinarily high,
although the above-mentioned special effects will not apply," the bank
said.

"In addition, due to the significant rise in market quotations for
natural gas, the corresponding end customer tariffs will be raised
significantly."

In 2021, annual average inflation jumped to 3.2 percent from 0.4 percent
in the previous year.
