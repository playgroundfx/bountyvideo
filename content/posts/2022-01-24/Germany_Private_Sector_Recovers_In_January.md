Germany's private sector rebounded in January, led by a stronger
performance from the manufacturing sector, flash survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Monday.

The flash composite output index rose unexpectedly to 54.3 in January
from 49.9 in December. The score was forecast to fall to 49.2. A score
above 50 indicates expansion.

The upturn was led by the manufacturing sector, which recorded its
strongest performance on the production front for five months as the
incidence of lengthening lead times on inputs eased to the lowest since
December 2020.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index improved to 60.5 in January
from 57.4 in the previous month. The expected level was 57.0.

At 52.2, the services PMI was up from 48.7 in December. Nonetheless,
this was the second-lowest level in the past nine months and above
economists' forecast of 48.0.

The data mark a positive start to the year and go some way to allaying
fears about Omicron's impact on the German [economy][1] in the first
quarter, Phil Smith, an economics associate director, at IHS Markit
said.
