Australia will on Tuesday release Q4 numbers for consumer prices,
highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

Inflation is tipped to rise 1.0 percent on quarter and 3.2 percent on
year, up from 0.8 percent on quarter and 3.0 percent on year in the
three months prior. The Reserve Bank of Australia's trimmed mean is
expected to rise 0.7 percent on quarter and 2.4 percent on year, while
the weighted median is pegged at 0.7 percent on quarter and 2.3 percent
on year.

South Korea will see an advance estimate for Q4 gross domestic product,
with forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.9 percent on quarter and 3.7
percent on year. That follows the 0.3 percent quarterly increase and the
4.0 percent yearly gain in the previous three months.
