The UK private sector logged a slower growth in January as the Omicron
variant continued to weigh on customer-facing parts of the [economy][1],
flash survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply flash composite output
index fell to 53.4 in January from 53.6 in December.

The index signaled the slowest rate of output expansion since the
recovery from lockdown began last spring and remained below the
economists' forecast of 55.0.

However, the indicator has stayed above the 50.0 no-change threshold for
the eleventh consecutive month.

Manufacturers outperformed service providers as a sustained turnaround
in materials availability led to the fastest rise in production volumes
for five months.

The services activity expanded at the slowest pace in eleven months,
reflecting ongoing pandemic disruptions and very subdued demand in
customer-facing parts of the economy.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index unexpectedly fell to 53.3 in
January from 53.6 in the previous month. The expected reading was 54.8.

With hospitality, leisure and travel all struggling due to Omicron
restrictions, this offset resilient growth in [business][2] and
financial services.

The manufacturing PMI declined to 56.9 in January, while the index was
forecast to remain unchanged at 57.9.

Manufacturing output increased to the greatest extent since August 2021,
despite survey respondents often reporting a negative impact on
production from staff isolating due to COVID-19 and supplier delays.

The composite data highlighted a robust and accelerated expansion of new
work received by UK private sector companies. Higher demand together
with persistent constraints on capacity led to another increase in
unfinished orders.

That said, a further strong rise in employment meant that the rate of
backlog accumulation was much slower than on average in the second half
of last year.  
  
Input cost inflation remained stubbornly high and accelerated to its
second-fastest since the survey began 24 years ago.

Business expectations for the year ahead were upbeat in January and the
degree of optimism rebounded to its strongest since August 2021.
