Singapore consumer price inflation rose in December, data published by
the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and
Industry showed on Monday.

Consumer price inflation increased to 4.0 percent in December from 3.8
percent in November. Economists had expected a 3.8 percent rise.

This latest acceleration in inflation was largely due to a rise in core
inflation and higher accommodation costs.

MAS core inflation rose to 2.1 percent in December from 1.6 percent in
the previous month.

The increase in the core rate was largely due to rise in airfares
reflecting higher prices of travel on vaccinated travel lanes.

In 2021, average consumer prices rose 2.3 percent, after a 0.2 percent
decline in 2020. At the same time, MAS core CPI increased 0.9 percent,
after a 0.2 percent fall in the previous year.
