The severe downturn in the euro area manufacturing sector continued to
ease in June amid easing of restrictions related to [coronavirus][1]
pandemic, final survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The final factory Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a four-month high
of 47.4 in June from 39.4 in May and improved from a flash reading of
46.9.

Nonetheless, the reading was below the neutral 50 for 17 successive
months, suggesting contraction.

The final PMI numbers for June add further to signs that the Eurozone
factories are seeing a strong initial recovery as the [economy][2] lifts
from Covid-19 lockdowns, Chris Williamson, chief [business][3] economist
at IHS Markit said.

The rise in the June survey is indicative of output falling at an annual
rate of just 2 percent, the economist noted.

Manufacturing output dropped only moderately in June and new orders fell
at the weakest pace in four months. Nonetheless, export sales declined
at a noticeable pace.

Due to lack of workloads, firms reduced staffing in June. Employment
decreased for the fourteenth straight month.

Latest prices data indicated that deflationary pressures remained
apparent across the sector. Input costs decreased for a thirteenth month
and output prices extended the current period of deflation to a year.

Finally, confidence about production in the year ahead returned to
positive territory in June, and reached its highest level in four
months.

All member countries of the currency bloc recorded a relative
improvement in their PMI readings in June. France posted PMI level above
50.0, with the best growth for 21 months.

Spain moved closer to stabilization, followed by Italy. Meanwhile,
Germany continued to lag the rest of the region.

After three months of sharp deterioration, France manufacturing sector
strengthened notably in June. The manufacturing PMI advanced to 52.3
from 40.6 in May. This was above the flash 52.1.

The severe downturn in the Germany's manufacturing sector also showed
further signs of easing in June. The final Markit/BME factory PMI came
in at 45.2, up from 36.6 a month ago and also above flash 44.6.
