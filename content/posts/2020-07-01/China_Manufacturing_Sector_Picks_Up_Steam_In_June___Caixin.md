The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in June, and at a
faster rate, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Wednesday with a
manufacturing PMI core of 51.2.

That's up from 50.7 in May and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, total new work increased for the first time since January,
although external demand remained subdued.

Employment meanwhile remained on a downward trend in June, with staffing
levels falling for the sixth month running. Firms often commented on the
non-replacement of voluntary leavers and planned redundancies.
