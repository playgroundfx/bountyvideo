The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to contract in June, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 46.2.

That's up from 41.9 in May, although it remains beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, there was a softer but still pronounced decline in output
and new orders. Output prices fell further, although import costs
increased.

Firms expressed renewed optimism towards the one-year [business][1]
outlook.
