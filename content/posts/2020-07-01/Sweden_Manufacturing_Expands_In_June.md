Sweden's manufacturing sector increased in June, survey data from
Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector increased to
47.3 in June from a revised 40.0 in May. Any reading below 50 indicates
contraction in the sector.

"However, the large rise in June should be seen as a rebound following
an exceptionally deep decline in the spring, but will also be supported
by the easing of restrictions placed on the [coronavirus][1]," Swedbank
analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-indices, order intake and production increased in June.
Suppliers' delivery times decreased for the second straight month.

"Reduced supply problems for the Swedish manufacturing industry as
several countries have opened previously closed borders appear to have
reduced suppliers' delivery times, Kennemar said.

Production plans for the next six months were more optimistic in June
and indicated a weaker price pressure, albeit an increase in price.
