After reporting contractions in U.S. manufacturing activity for three
straights months, the Institute for Supply Management released a report
on Wednesday showing activity unexpectedly expanded in the month of
June.

The ISM said its purchasing managers index jumped to 52.6 in June from
43.1 in May, with a reading above 50 indicating an expansion in
manufacturing activity.

Economists had expected the index to climb to 49.5, which have still
indicated a modest contraction in manufacturing activity.

"As predicted, the growth cycle has returned after three straight months
of COVID-19 disruptions," said Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM
Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.

He added, "Demand, consumption and inputs are reaching parity and are
positioned for a demand-driven expansion cycle as we enter the second
half of the year."

The headline index recorded its largest increase since August 1980, as
the new orders index spiked to 56.4 in June from 31.8 in May and the
production index soared to 57.3 from 33.2.

The report said the employment index also surged up to 42.1 in June from
32.1 in May, indicating a slower pace of job losses in the manufacturing
sector.

On the inflation front, the prices index jumped to 51.3 in June from
40.8 in May, pointing to an increase in raw materials prices after four
consecutive months of declines.

A note from economists at Oxford Economics said manufacturing activity
likely bottomed in the second quarter but noted the sector will face
major challenges that will drag on its recovery.

"Looking ahead, weak demand, lingering supply chain disruptions,
somewhat tighter financial conditions, [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low oil prices and
highly elevated uncertainty are poised to make for a lackluster
recovery," the economists said.

They added, "Further, with the number of [coronavirus][1] cases now
rising in many parts of the country, including several states where
manufacturing activity is concentrated, the nascent recovery risks being
curtailed by the re-imposition of lockdowns."

The ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on U.S. service sector
activity in the month of June next Monday.
