With interest rates expected to remain at near-zero levels for the
foreseeable future, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's June meeting
showed participants discussed new tools for conducting monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

The minutes showed the meeting included briefings on the roles of
forward guidance and large-scale asset purchase programs as well as
implementing yield curve control.

In their discussion of forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases,
various participants noted the [economy][1] is likely to need support
for some time and that it will be important for the Fed to provide
greater clarity regarding the likely path of interest rates and asset
purchases.

Participants generally indicated support for outcome-based forward
guidance, the minutes said, with a number speaking favorably about
guidance tied to inflation outcomes.

Meanwhile, a couple of participants signaled a preference for forward
guidance tied to the unemployment rate and a few others suggested
[calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)-based guidance.

"Regardless of the specific form of forward guidance, a couple of
participants expressed the concern that policies that effectively
committed the Committee to maintaining very low interest rates for a
long time could ultimately pose significant risks to financial
stability," the minutes said.

With regard to potential yield curve control, the minutes said nearly
all participants indicated they had "many questions regarding the costs
and benefits of such an approach."

Many participants expressed that, as long as the Fed's forward guidance

Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said the
minutes suggest "the Fed is still a long way from rolling out explicit
targets for longer-term Treasury yields."

While recent data has pointed to some stabilization by the economy
following the [coronavirus][2]-induced downturn, participants noted
there continues to be an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and
considerable risks to the economic outlook.

"A number of participants judged that there was a substantial likelihood
of additional waves of outbreaks, which, in some scenarios, could result
in further economic disruptions and possibly a protracted period of
reduced economic activity," the minutes said.

Participants subsequently reaffirmed that the Fed was committed to using
its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging
time.

The Fed voted unanimously to maintain the target for the federal funds
rate at zero to 0.25 percent and indicated rates would remain at current
levels until [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers were confident that the economy had weathered
recent.

Economic projections submitted at the meeting showed most Fed officials
expect rates to remain at current levels through 2022, with only a
couple predicting an increase in rates.
