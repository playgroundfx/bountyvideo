The UK manufacturing sector showed signs of stabilizing in June,
following the steep downturn caused by the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, pandemic, final data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply/ IHS Markit
manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose sharply to 50.1 in June
from 40.7 in May. The reading came in line with the flash estimate.

As factories restarted, production increased slightly for the first time
in four months in June. Incoming new [business][2] also showed signs of
stabilizing in June.

Domestic market demand improved as lockdown restrictions were loosened,
while new export business fell for the eighth straight month.

Employment decreased for the fifth consecutive month in June. Although
the rate of decline eased further from April's record it remained among
the steepest registered in the 28-year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

On price front, the survey showed that cost inflationary pressure
remained subdued. Although input prices increased at the fastest rate in
a year, the pace was mild compared to the survey average. Output charges
also increased in June.

Over 63 percent of manufacturers forecast that output would rise over
the coming year.

The planned loosening in Covid-19 restrictions on the July 4 should aid
further gains in coming months, Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit,
said. The main focus is now shifting towards the labour market, he said.

Dobson noted that economic conditions will need to improve markedly
across the UK, or some support retained, if the labor market downturn is
to avoid becoming more entrenched through the remainder of the year.
