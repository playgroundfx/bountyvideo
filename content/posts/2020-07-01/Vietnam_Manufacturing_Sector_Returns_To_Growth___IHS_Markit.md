The manufacturing sector in Vietnam swung back to expansion in June, the
latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on Wednesday with a manufacturing
PMI score of 51.1.

That's up from 42.7 in May, and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new orders increased at a solid pace, while there was
renewed expansion in production.

Despite new orders increasing at the end of the second quarter, there
was continued evidence of spare capacity in the sector. Backlogs of work
fell again, while staffing levels were reduced for the fifth month
running.
