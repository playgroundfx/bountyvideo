India's manufacturing conditions weakened in June with regional lockdown
extensions, but the pace of contraction slowed further, survey results
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or
PMI, increased to 47.2 in June from 30.8 in May. Any reading below 50
indicates contraction in the sector.

The manufacturing sector declined for the third consecutive month.

Output contracted sharply in June and sales fell for the third straight
month, albeit at a slower pace since the introduction of lockdown
measures in March.

New export orders fell for the fourth month in a row. Employment
decreased in June, remaining among the quickest since the survey began
in March 2005.

Firms reduced their purchasing activity for the fourth straight month
and input buying declined at the slowest pace since March.

On the price front, input prices continued to fall in June and
manufacturers continued to reduce output prices.

Firms remained positive for the 12-month [business][1] in June with the
sentiment strengthening to a four-month high.

"The recent spike in new [coronavirus][2] cases and the resulting
lockdown extensions have seen demand continue to weaken," Eliot Kerr, an
economist at IHS Markit, said.

"Should case numbers continue rising at their current pace, further
lockdown extensions may be imposed, which would likely derail a recovery
in economic conditions and prolong the woes of those most severely
affected by this crisis," the economist added.
