Poland's manufacturing sector contracted at a slower pace in June,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 47.2 in
June from 40.6 in May. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the
sector.

The gain was the second biggest in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

New orders continued to fall in June and demand remained weak amid
Covid-19 crisis. New works declined to the weakest since August 2019.

New export [business][1] continued to fell in June and new contracts
placed with international clients continued declining since August 2018.

Output fell for the twentieth month in a row n June, though at the
slowest rate in four months. Employment rate reduced further with the
rate of job shedding slowest in four months.

Firms were more optimistic regarding the 12-month outlook for production
in June.

Firms reduced purchases and stocks of new inputs in June and suppliers'
delivery time lengthened slightly.

On the price front, input prices rose in June, while output prices fell
for the third straight month. The rate of input cost inflation was the
slowest in seven months.

"The Polish PMI made further strides toward the 50.0 stabilization mark
in June, but manufacturing conditions remain challenging even as the
sector moves past the worst phase of the lockdown,"Trevor Balchin,
economics director at IHS Markit, said.
