Australia will on Thursday release May figures for imports, exports and
trade balance, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

In April, imports were down 10 percent on month and exports were down 11
percent on month for a trade surplus of A$8.8 billion.

South Korea will see June figures for consumer prices, with forecasts
suggesting an increase of 0.05 percent on month and a drop of 0.1
percent on year. That follows the 0.2 percent monthly decline and the
0.3 percent yearly fall in May.
