Germany's retail sales rebounded unexpectedly in May, figures from
Destatis revealed Wednesday.

Retail turnover increased 3.8 percent on a yearly basis, reversing a 6.4
percent fall in April. Economists had forecast sales to fall 3.5
percent.

Month-on-month, retail sales advanced 13.9 percent, in contrast to a
decline of 6.5 percent logged in April. This was much bigger than
economists' forecast of 3.9 percent.

Food, beverages and tobacco sales were up 4.9 percent annually and non-
food sales grew 3.5 percent in May.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail turnover increased 13.4 percent on month taking
the annual growth to 4.6 percent in May.
