The manufacturing sector in the Philippines continued to contract in
June, albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit
revealed on Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 49.7.

That's up from 40.1 in May, although it remains beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, manufacturers raised their output levels for the first
time since February.

New orders continued to fall, but the rate of decline eased
considerably. Job shedding accelerated to its fastest rate in three
months.
