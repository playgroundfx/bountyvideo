Sweden's central bank expanded its quantitative easing and maintained
interest rate at zero to support recovery and lift inflation as the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic substantially hurt the [economy][2].

The executive board of Riksbank decided to expand the asset purchases
programme to SEK 500 billion from SEK 300 billion. The programme will
continue until the end of June 2021.

The bank left its repo rate unchanged at zero percent and signaled that
it is prepared to take the rate to negative zone.

The board further decided to cut interest rates and extend maturities
for lending to banks.

Riksbank will purchase government bonds, mortgage bonds and municipal
bonds for SEK 100 billion between October 1 and December 31. The bank
will offer to purchase corporate bonds for SEK 10 billion up to June 30,
2021.

"All in all, the Riksbank's measures mean that there will be
comprehensive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus in the form of low interest rates
and a large amount of liquidity for the foreseeable future," the bank
said.

These measures would create the conditions for a recovery in the Swedish
economy and will help inflation rise towards the target of 2 percent
towards the end of the forecast period, the bank added.

The unemployment is expected to continue rising and inflation is set to
take time before returning to the target, Riksbank observed.

The central bank forecast inflation to slow to 0.5 percent this year,
before rising to 1.4 percent in 2021.

Even if the economy gradually recovers in the coming years, it will take
some time before resource utilization in the Swedish economy, Riksbank
said. GDP is expected to shrink 4.5 percent in 2020 but expand 3.6
percent next year and 4.1 percent in 2022.
