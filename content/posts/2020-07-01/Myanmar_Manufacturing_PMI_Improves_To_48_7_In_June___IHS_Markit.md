The manufacturing sector in Myanmar continued to contract in June,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 48.7.

That's up from 38.9 in May, although it remains beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new [business][1] both expanded for the first
time since February, while there was a further drop in employment.

Expectations for the year ahead continue to be weak.
