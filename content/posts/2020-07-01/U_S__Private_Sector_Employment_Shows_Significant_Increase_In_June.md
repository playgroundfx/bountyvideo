A report released by payroll processor ADP on Wednesday showed a
significant increase in private sector employment in the month of June
as well as a substantial upward revision to the data for May.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 2.369 million jobs in June,
which was below economist estimates for a spike of about 3.000 million
jobs.

However, revised data showed private sector employment soared by 3.065
million jobs in May compared to the previously reported loss of 2.760
million jobs.
