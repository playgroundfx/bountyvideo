A report released by payroll processor ADP on Wednesday showed a
significant increase in private sector employment in the month of June
as well as a substantial upward revision to the data for May.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 2.369 million jobs in June,
which was below economist estimates for a spike of about 3.000 million
jobs.

However, revised data showed private sector employment soared by 3.065
million jobs in May compared to the previously reported loss of 2.760
million jobs.

The job growth in June was led by the leisure and hospitality industry,
which saw employment spike by 961,000 jobs.

The construction, trade, transportation and utilities, and education and
[health][1] services sectors also saw considerable job growth during the
month.

"As the [economy][2] slowly continues to recover, we are seeing a
significant rebound in industries that once experienced the greatest job
losses," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP
Research Institute.

She added, "In fact, 70 percent of the jobs added this month were in the
leisure and hospitality, trade and construction industries."

Yildirmaz also noted that small [business][3] hiring picked up in June,
skyrocketing by 937,000 jobs during the month.

Employment at large businesses also surged up by 873,000 jobs, while
employment at mid-sized businesses jumped by 559,000 jobs.

On Thursday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more
closely watched monthly jobs report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.

Economists expect employment to spike by 3.00 million jobs in June after
unexpectedly soaring by 2.51 million jobs in May.
