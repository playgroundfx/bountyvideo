The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to contract in June,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 39.1.

That's up from 28.6 in May, although it remains beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production and new orders both fell at slower rates, while
[business][1] confidence improved to a five-month high.

There was an accelerated rise in input costs due to a weak rupiah.
