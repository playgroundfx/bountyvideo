France's [business][1] confidence was stable in March, as manufacturers
turned optimistic regarding the overall production outlook, ahead of the
announcement of a third lockdown in several regions to curb the spread
of coronavirus infections.  
  
The manufacturing business confidence index reading was 98, unchanged
from February, survey data from Insee showed Thursday. The score is the
highest since March last year, when it was at the same level.  
  
Economists had expected a modest improvement in the index to 98 from
February's original score of 97.

The confidence reading remained below the long-term average of 100.  
  
The survey data were collected between February 26 and March 22, which
means a large part was before the March 18 announcement of the third
lockdown for some regions.

Manufacturers' general production expectations reached its highest point
since October 2018 with the index rising to 6 from -7 in the previous
month.  
  
However, they lowered their opinion on their personal production
prospects as well as order-books, especially in the automotive industry,
the Insee said.  
  
New restrictions announced on March 18 and implemented on March 20 will
lead to a deterioration of the business climate in April, ING economist
Charlotte de Montpellier said.  
  
"If the [health][2] restrictions can indeed start to be lifted in the
second quarter due to the progress of the vaccination campaign, we
expect GDP to grow by around 5 percent for the year, below the
government's 6 percent target," the economist added.
