Economic activity in the U.S. unexpectedly grew faster than previously
estimated in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to revised data
released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.

The report showed real gross domestic product surged up by 4.3 percent
in the fourth quarter compared to the previously reported 4.1 percent
jump. Economists had expected the pace of GDP growth to be unrevised.

The Commerce Department said the stronger than previously estimated
growth primarily reflected an upward revision to private inventory
investment that was partly offset by a downward revision to non-
residential fixed investment.
