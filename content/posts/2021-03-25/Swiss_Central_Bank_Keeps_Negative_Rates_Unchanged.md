Switzerland's central bank retained its negative interest rate and
softened its view on the currency market interventions given the recent
fall in the Swiss franc against the euro.

Policymakers of the Swiss National Bank retained the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and
interest on sight deposits at the SNB at -0.75 percent, as widely
expected, on Thursday.

Despite the recent weakening, the bank repeated that the Swiss franc
remains highly valued. The bank said it is willing to intervene in the
foreign exchange market 'as necessary', while taking the overall
currency situation into consideration.

At the previous meeting in December, the bank had said t is willing to
intervene 'more strongly' in the currency market.

Looking ahead, the stage is set for further inaction by the SNB over the
coming years, David Oxley, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
While the bank would be willing to counter any sudden increases in the
currency, it will be able to stay out of the market.

The central bank today raised its inflation outlook citing the rise in
oil prices and the weaker Swiss franc. Consumer prices are forecast to
rise 0.2 percent in 2021 instead of nil growth estimated in December.

Likewise, the inflation outlook for 2022 was revised up to 0.4 percent
from 0.2 percent. For 2023, inflation is seen at 0.5 percent.

"With inflation expected to be 0.5% in 2023, it seems clear that we
should not expect the SNB to raise its key interest rate in the next few
years, contrary to what we can expect elsewhere in the world," Charlotte
de Montpellier, an ING economist said.

The SNB expects the [economy][1] to grow in the range of 2.5 percent to
3 percent in 2021, unchanged from the previous projection.

Regarding labor market, the central bank said the second wave of the
pandemic is weighing on employment. Short-term working increased in
recent months and unemployment continued to rise.

Further, the bank noted that mortgage lending and residential property
prices increased in recent quarters. The vulnerability of these
[markets][2] persists and continues to present a risk for financial
stability.
