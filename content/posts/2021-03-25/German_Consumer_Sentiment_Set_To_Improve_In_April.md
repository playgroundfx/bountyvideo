German consumer sentiment is set to improve in April after the easing of
the hard lockdown and falling infection rates at the time of the survey,
data from market research group GfK showed Thursday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index rose to -6.2 in April from
revised -12.7 in March. The reading was forecast to climb to -11.9.

With infection rates rising again and the lockdown will be tightened
again, it is questionable whether the improvement in consumer confidence
will continue, Gfk observed.

"A sustained recovery in consumer confidence will continue to be a long
time coming — which means difficult times ahead for retailers and
manufacturers," Rolf Bürkl, GfK consumer expert, said.

The income expectations indicator gained 15.8 points to 22.3 points in
March. Income expectations significantly contributed to the sharp
increase in sentiment.

The propensity to buy also increased in March. The corresponding index
climbed 4.9 points to12.3 points.

The economic expectations index rose 9.7 points to 17.7 in March. With
the first easing from the hard lockdown, consumers expect the German
[economy][1] to recover further.
