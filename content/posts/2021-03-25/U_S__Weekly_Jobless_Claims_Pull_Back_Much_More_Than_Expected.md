After reporting an unexpected increase in first-time claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits in the previous week, the Labor Department
released a report on Thursday showing initial jobless claims pulled back
by much more than expected in the week ended March 20th.

The report said initial jobless claims slid to 684,000, a decrease of
97,000 from the previous week's revised level of 781,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to decline to 730,000 from the
770,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the much bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims dropped to
their lowest level since hitting 282,000 in the week ended March 14,
2020.
