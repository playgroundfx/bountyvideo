South Africa's producer price inflation rose to the highest level in
twelve months in February, figures from Statistics South Africa showed
on Thursday.

The producer price index rose 4.0 percent year-on-year in February,
following a 3.5 percent increase in January. Economists had expected
inflation to rise to 3.8 percent.

The latest producer price inflation was the highest since February last
year, when prices rose 4.5 percent.

The main contribution for the increase in prices came from food
products, beverages and tobacco products, metals, machinery, equipment
and computing equipment, and transport equipment in February.

Producer prices for mining industry gained 11.5 percent annually in
February and prices for electricity and water increased 9.2 percent.

Prices for agriculture, forestry and fishing, and intermediate goods
rose by 10.0 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.7 percent in February.
Economists had expected a 0.5 percent rise.
