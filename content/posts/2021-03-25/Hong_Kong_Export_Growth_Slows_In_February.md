Hong Kong's merchandise exports grew at a softer pace in February, data
from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Thursday.

Exports rose 30.4 percent year-on-year in February, after a 44.0 percent
increase in January.

Imports gained 17.6 percent annually in February, following a 37.7
percent increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit widened to HK$14.699 billion in February from
HK$38.551 billion in the same month last year. In January, the deficit
was HK$25.228 billion.

"Taking the first two months of 2021 together to remove the distortion
caused by the difference in timing of the Lunar New Year, the value of
merchandise exports increased sharply by 37.6 percent over a year
earlier, reflecting a further pick-up in growth momentum alongside the
revival of global trading and production activities," a government
spokesman said.
