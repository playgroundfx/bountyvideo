The Philippines' central bank left its key interest rate unchanged
Thursday, citing the prospect of inflation overshooting its target in
the medium term.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas decided to hold
the key interest rate, which is the overnight reverse repurchase
facility rate, steady at 2.00 percent. This was in line with economists'
expectations.

"The Monetary Board is of the view that prevailing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
settings remain appropriate to support the Government's broader efforts
to facilitate the recovery of the [economy][1]," the central bank said
in a statement.

Policymakers stressed the importance of the timely implementation of
non-monetary interventions in mitigating the impact of supply-side
pressures on inflation and thereby preventing them from spilling over as
second-round effects.

Previously, the key rate was reduced by a quarter-point in November. The
bank lowered the rate by a cumulative 200 basis points in 2020.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
maintained at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.

The central bank expects inflation to breach the upper end of the target
range of 2-4 percent this year, driven by the impact of supply-side
constraints on domestic prices of key food commodities as well as the
continuing uptick in international oil prices.

Inflation was projected to return within the target band in 2022 as
supply-side influences subside.

Supply-side constraints for meat products and improved global economic
activity could add further upside pressures on inflation, while the
ongoing [coronavirus][2] pandemic pose downside risks.

The recent surge in virus infections and challenges over mass
vaccination programs continue to temper prospects for domestic demand,
the bank said.  
Policymakers will remain watchful for any signs of inflation becoming
broader based and is ready to take immediate measures when needed, the
bank said.

"While a temporary rise in inflation means interest rates are set to
remain on hold for the next few months, the dire economic outlook means
the bank is still likely to cut rates later this year, Capital Economics
economist Alex Holmes said.
