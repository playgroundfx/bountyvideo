Russia's central bank raised its key interest rate Friday, defying
expectations that the rate will be left unchanged, citing higher than
forecast inflation and a faster than expected recovery in domestic
demand.

The Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 25 basis
points to 4.50 percent, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
Economists had expected the rate to remain at 4.25 percent.

Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated and
the balance of risks has shifted towards proinflationary ones, the
central bank said.

The bank also said that it "holds open the prospect of further increases
in the key rate at its upcoming meetings."
