Russia's central bank unexpectedly raised its key interest rate Friday,
citing higher than forecast inflation and a faster than expected
recovery in domestic demand.

The Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 25 basis
points to 4.50 percent, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
Economists had expected the rate to remain at 4.25 percent.

The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in July
last year.  
  
The bank said that it "holds open the prospect of further increases in
the key rate at its upcoming meetings."

Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated and
the balance of risks has shifted towards proinflationary ones, the
central bank said.

In her post-decision speech, the central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina
said the bank has begun to return to neutral monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).  
  
"It is necessary to prevent further inflation acceleration," Nabiullina
said. "Inflation expectations need to be reduced as soon as possible."

The central bank expects annual inflation to return to its target close
to 4 percent in the first half of 2022 and to remain at that level
further on.

Following the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement, Capital Economics forecast
quarter-point hikes in April and June, with additional tightening later
this year taking the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate to 5.25 percent by year-end.

"The central bank went much further than anybody was expecting in
delivering its guidance for significant monetary tightening to bring
inflation down," Capital Economics economist Liam Peach said.

"The CBR's determination to rein in inflation and a possible increase in
the threat of tighter sanctions later this year, argues strongly in
favor of additional tightening," the economist added.
