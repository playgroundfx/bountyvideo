Romania's merchandise trade deficit for July narrowed from a year ago,
as exports fell softer than imports, figures from the National Institute
of Statistics showed on Wednesday.  
  
The trade deficit shrunk to EUR 1.323 billion from EUR 1.778 billion in
the same month of 2019. In June, the shortfall was EUR 1.318 billion.  
  
Exports decreased 5.1 percent year-on-year following a 12.9 percent
decline in June. Imports fell 9.9 percent after a 7.9 percent drop in
the previous month.  
  
In the January to July period, the trade deficit was EUR 9.990 billion
with a 16.2 percent slump in exports and a 12.2 percent fall in imports.
