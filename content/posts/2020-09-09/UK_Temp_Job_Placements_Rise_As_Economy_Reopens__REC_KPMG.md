UK firms raised temporary job placements in August following the
relaxation of public [health][1] measures and reopening of the UK
[economy][2] after the Covid-19 outbreak, the latest KPMG and REC Report
on Jobs showed Wednesday.

According to the report compiled by IHS Markit, permanent placements
increased only slightly, while temp billings expanded at the fastest
rate for 20 months.

Temporary work is critical in any recovery - businesses turn to temps to
help them ramp up and meet demand while the future looks uncertain, Neil
Carberry, Chief Executive of the REC, said.

At the same time, it enables people to find work quickly, Carberry
added. Past recessions show that temporary work bounces back more
quickly - it is one of our jobs market's biggest strengths and that's
really showing now.

Availability of workers continued to expand at a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly sharp rate
in August as company lay-offs had raised candidate numbers.

Increased worker availability and muted demand for staff continued to
weigh on starting pay in August. Both starting salaries and temporary
wages declined at weaker rates.

Overall vacancies decreased for the sixth straight month in August, with
the rate of decrease quickening slightly since July.
