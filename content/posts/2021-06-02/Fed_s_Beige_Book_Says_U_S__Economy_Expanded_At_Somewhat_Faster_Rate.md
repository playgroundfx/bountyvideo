Partly reflecting the positive effects of increased Covid-19 vaccination
rates and relaxed social distancing measures, the Federal Reserve's
Beige Book said Wednesday the U.S. [economy][1] increased at a somewhat
faster rate from early April to late May.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in each of the twelve Fed districts, still described the pace
of economic growth as moderate.

The Fed said the effects of expanded vaccination rates were most notable
in consumer spending, as increased leisure travel and restaurant
spending augmented ongoing strength in other spending categories.

However, several districts also noted the adverse impacts of supply
chain disruptions, with manufacturers reporting that widespread
shortages of materials and labor along with delivery delays made it
difficult to get products to customers.

Similar challenges also affected the housing sector, where strong
demand, buoyed by low mortgage interest rates, outpaced homebuilders'
capacity to build, leading some to limit sales.

The Fed acknowledged the continuing supply chain disruptions also
contributed to an increase in overall price pressures since the last
Beige Book in April.

"Input costs have continued to increase across the board, with many
[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s noting sharp increases in construction and manufacturing raw
materials prices," the Fed said.

With strengthening demand allowing some businesses to pass through
higher costs to their customers, [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s anticipate facing further cost
increases and charging higher prices in coming months.

Ahead of Friday's closely watched monthly jobs report, the Beige Book
said staffing levels increased at a relatively steady pace, with two-
thirds of the districts reporting modest employment growth over the
reporting period.

While job growth was strongest in food services, hospitality, and
retail, the Fed noted it remained difficult for many firms to hire new
workers, especially low-wage hourly workers, truck drivers, and skilled
tradespeople.

"The lack of job candidates prevented some firms from increasing output
and, less commonly, led some businesses to reduce their hours of
operation," the Fed said.

The release of the Beige Book comes two weeks ahead of the Federal
Reserve's next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, which is scheduled for June
15-16.
