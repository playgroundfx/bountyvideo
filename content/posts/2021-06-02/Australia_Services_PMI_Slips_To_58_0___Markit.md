The services sector in Australia continued to expand in May, albeit at a
slightly slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Thursday with a services PMI score of 58.0.

That's down from 58.8 in April, although it remains well above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New [business][1] inflows increased for the ninth straight month in May,
supported by an improvement in economic conditions following the easing
of COVID-19 restrictions and the positive effects of government
stimulus. Although easing from April's record, the rate of expansion in
new work remained considerable.

Sustained rises in orders and activity encouraged firms in the service
sector to continue expanding their operating capacity. Job creation
continued for the seventh successive month in May and at the fastest
pace since the survey started in May 2016.

Also, the composite index fell to 58.0 in May from 58.9 in April.
