Consumer prices in New Zealand were up 4.9 percent on year in the third
quarter of 2021, Statistics New Zealand said on Monday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 4.1 percent and was up
sharply from 3.3 percent in the previous three months.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, New Zealand's consumer prices
were up 2.2 percent - again beating forecasts for an increase of 1.4
percent and accelerating from the 1.3 percent gain in the three months
prior.
