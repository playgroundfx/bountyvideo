China is scheduled to release a raft of data on Monday, highlighting a
busy day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. On tap are Q3 numbers for
gross domestic product, as well as September figures for industrial
production, retail sales, fixed asset investment, unemployment and
foreign direct investment.

GDP is expected to gain 0.5 percent on quarter and 5.2 percent on year,
slowing from 1.3 percent on quarter and 7.9 percent on year in the
previous three months.

Industrial production is tipped to rise 4.5 percent on year, down from
5.3 percent in August. Retail sales are expected to climb an annual 3.3
percent, up from 2.5 percent a month earlier. FAI is called higher by
7.9 percent on year, down from 8.9 percent in the previous month. The
jobless rate in August was 5.1 percent, while FDI was up 22.3 percent on
year.

New Zealand will provide Q3 data for consumer prices and also see
September results for the Performance of Services Index from BusinessNZ.

Inflation is tipped to rise 1.4 percent on quarter and 4.1 percent on
year in Q3, up from 1.3 percent on quarter and 3.3 percent on year in
the previous three months. The service index in August had a score of
35.6.

Singapore will release September numbers for non-oil domestic exports,
with forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.6 percent on month and 8.5
