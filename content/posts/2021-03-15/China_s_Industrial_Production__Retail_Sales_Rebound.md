China's industrial production and retail sales rebounded in January to
February, reflecting a strong recovery from the pandemic driven
downturn, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday.

Industrial production climbed 35.1 percent year-on-year in January to
February period, faster than the 7.3 percent growth seen in December.
This was also bigger than the expected rate of 30 percent.

Likewise, retail sales growth accelerated to 33.8 percent from 4.6
percent in December. Sales were forecast to gain 32 percent.

In January to February, fixed asset investment grew 35 percent from the
same period last year. Economists had forecast a faster expansion of 40
percent.

The surveyed unemployment rate came in at 5.5 percent in February, up
from 5.2 percent in December.

This set of data shows the Chinese [economy][1] is recovering from
Covid, especially in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of consumption, Iris Pang, an economist at
ING said.

But the very low base also masked the degree to which these strong
figures are driven by underlying growth, the economist added. These low
base-effects could last until April as economic activity started to pick
up in May last year.

Activity is expected to remain strong in the near-term, as the easing of
virus restrictions boosts consumption and fiscal stimulus among key
trading partners should keep exports strong, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an
economist at Capital Economics. Further ahead, however, momentum will
soften.
