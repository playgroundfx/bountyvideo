Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said Monday an increase in the
market interest rates mirror the improvement in the economic outlook.

"We have seen some increase in interest rates over the last month or so,
as have other countries," Bailey said in an interview to BBC Radio 4.

"My assessment so far is that is consistent...with the change in the
economic outlook."

At its Thursday meeting, the Bank of England is expected to maintain its
key interest rate at record low 0.10 percent and its bond purchases at
GBP 895 billion.

Meanwhile, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers in rest of Europe and Asia have expressed
concern that the rising yields could derail the economic recovery after
the Covid-19 induced slump.

Last week, European Central Bank President warned that an increase in
market interest rates at this juncture was "undesirable" as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers
vowed to front load the bank's pandemic era bond purchases.
