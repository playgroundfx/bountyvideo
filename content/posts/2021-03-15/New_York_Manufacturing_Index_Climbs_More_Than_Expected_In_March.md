A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Monday
showed an acceleration in the pace of growth in New York manufacturing
activity in the month of March.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index climbed
to 17.4 in March from 12.1 in February, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to rise to 14.5

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months, anticipating
significant increases in employment.
