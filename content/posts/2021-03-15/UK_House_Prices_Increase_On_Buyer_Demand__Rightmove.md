UK house prices increased in March as buyer demand reached record
levels, property market [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove said Monday.

House prices rose 0.8 percent month-on-month in March, following a 0.5
percent rise in February.

The number of potential buyers enquiring about each available property
in the month was at a record, and was 34 percent higher than the same
period a year ago.

With sales already agreed for almost two out of three properties on
agents' books, buyers eagerly await fresh choice coming to market,
making this the best sellers' market of the past ten years, Rightmove
said.

The current demand was driven by the side effects of the lockdowns and
the additional spur of government incentives. Rightmove anticipates
further price rises during the traditional spring selling season.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove's Director of Property Data commented that
there are early signs that the supply shortage may now be easing, with
more owners deciding to market their properties, spurred by the
extension of government incentives and a more tangible roadmap to
normality.

Year-on-year, house price growth slowed to 2.7 percent in March from 3
percent in the previous month.
