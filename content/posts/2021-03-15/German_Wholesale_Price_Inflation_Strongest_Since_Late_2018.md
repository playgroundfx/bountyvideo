German wholesale price inflation reached its strongest level since late
2018, Destatis reported Monday.

Wholesale prices advanced 2.3 percent year-on-year in February, after
staying flat in January. This was the fastest growth since December
2018.

The annual growth was largely driven by the price increase in the
wholesale of ores, metals and metal semi-finished products. In contrast,
prices for live animals and meat and meat products, declined sharply
from the previous year.  
  
Month-on-month, wholesale prices gained 1.4 percent versus 2.1 percent
increase in January.
