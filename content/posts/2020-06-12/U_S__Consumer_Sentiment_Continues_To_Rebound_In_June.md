After reporting a record nosedive in U.S. consumer sentiment in March
and April, the University of Michigan released a report on Friday
showing sentiment continued to improve in June following a modest
rebound in May.

The preliminary report showed the consumer sentiment index for June
climbed to 78.6 from 72.3 in May and 71.8 in April. Economists had
expected the index to rise 75.0.

Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin said the increase by
the index reflected gains in the outlook for personal finances and more
favorable prospects for the national [economy][1] due to the reopening
of the economy.

"The turnaround is largely due to renewed gains in employment, with more
consumers expecting declines in the jobless rate than at any other time
in the long [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the Michigan surveys," Curtin said.

However, he added, "Despite the expected economic gains, few consumers
anticipate the reestablishment of favorable economic conditions anytime
soon."

The bigger than expected increase by the headline index came as the
current economic conditions index advanced to 87.8 in June from 82.3 in
May and the index of consumer expectations jumped to 73.1 from 65.9.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations dipped to 3.0
percent in June after spiking to 3.2 percent in May, while five-year
inflation expectations edged down to 2.6 percent from 2.7 percent.
