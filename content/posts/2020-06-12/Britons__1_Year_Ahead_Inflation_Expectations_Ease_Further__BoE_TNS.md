Britons' inflation expectations for the coming year slowed in May, the
quarterly Bank of England/TNS Inflation Attitudes Survey showed Friday.

Respondents forecast inflation to slow to 2.9 percent in the coming year
compared to 3 percent projected in February. Expected inflation for the
twelve months after that decreased to 1.9 percent from 2.9 percent.

Median expectations for inflation in the longer-term, say in five years'
time fell to 2.6 percent from 3.4 percent.

The survey showed that 55 percent of respondents thought the 2 percent
inflation target was 'about right', up from 52 percent in February. The
proportions saying the target was 'too high' or 'too low' were 33
percent and 12 percent, respectively.

When asked about the future path of interest rates, 39 percent said they
expected rates to stay about the same over the coming year, compared
with 29 percent in February.

About 42 percent of respondents expected rates to rise over the next 12
months, up from 39 percent in February.
