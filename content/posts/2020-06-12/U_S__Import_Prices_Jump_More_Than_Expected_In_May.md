Reflecting a substantial rebound in fuel prices, the Labor Department
released a report on Friday showing a bigger than expected jump in U.S.
import prices in the month of May.

The Labor Department said import prices surged up by 1.0 percent in May
after plunging by 2.6 percent in April. Economists had expected import
prices to increase by 0.6 percent.

The rebound in import prices came as fuel prices spiked by 20.5 percent
in May following the 31.0 percent nosedive in the previous month.

The report also showed a rebound in export prices, which climbed by 0.5
percent in May after tumbling by 3.3 percent in April. Export prices
were expected to rise by 0.6 percent.
