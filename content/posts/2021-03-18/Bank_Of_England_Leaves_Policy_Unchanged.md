Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers unanimously decided to keep its benchmark
rate and quantitative easing unchanged on Thursday.

The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, headed by Governor Andrew
Bailey, voted to hold the interest rate at 0.10 percent and the
quantitative easing at GBP 895 billion in the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting.

All members of the MPC judged that the existing stance of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remained appropriate.

The committee said it did not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at least
until there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made
in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation
target sustainably.

If the outlook for inflation weakened, the committee stood ready to take
whatever additional action was necessary to achieve its remit, the bank
said.
