A reading on Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity spiked to a nearly
50-year high in the month of March, the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia revealed in a report on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity soared to
51.8 in March from 23.1 in February, with a positive reading indicating
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to come in unchanged.

With the substantial increase, the Philly Fed Index skyrocketed to its
highest level since hitting 53.6 in April of 1973.

The surge by the headline index came as the new orders index also jumped
to a nearly 50-year high, spiking to 50.9 in March from 23.4 in
February.

The shipments index also climbed to 30.2 in March from 21.5 in February,
while the number of employees index rose to 30.1 from 25.3.

On the inflation front, the prices paid index shot up 75.9 in March from
54.4 in February, reaching its highest level since March of 1980. The
prices received index also jumped to 31.8 from 16.7.

The Philly Fed also said the survey's future indexes indicate more
optimism about continued growth over the next six months.

The diffusion index for future general activity soared to 61.6 in March
from 39.5 in February, more than offsetting the drop seen in the
previous month to reach its highest reading since June of 2020.

"Looking ahead, solid goods demand, rising [business][1] investment, and
generous federal pandemic relief will drive a sustained regional
manufacturing expansion," said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

A separate report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on
Monday showed an acceleration in the pace of growth in New York
manufacturing activity in the month of March.

The New York Fed said its general business conditions index climbed to
17.4 in March from 12.1 in February, with a positive reading indicating
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to rise to 14.5.

With the bigger than expected increase, the general business conditions
index reached its highest level since hitting 21.2 in November of 2018.
