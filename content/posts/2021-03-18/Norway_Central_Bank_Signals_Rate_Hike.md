At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, Norway's central bank signaled that the
interest rates will probably be raised in the second half of 2021.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee on Thursday,
unanimously decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at zero percent.

The bank expects a faster pick-up in economic activity than previously
projected on improving global developments.

"The overall outlook and balance of risks imply a continued expansionary
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance," Governor Ã˜ystein Olsen, said. "When there are
clear signs that economic conditions are normalising, it will again be
appropriate to raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate gradually from today's level,"
Olsen added.

The bank forecast a gradual rise in the interest rate from the latter
half of 2021.  
  
Bank will tighten sooner and faster than it currently projects, and
forecast the Norwegian krone to rise further this year, David Oxley, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.
