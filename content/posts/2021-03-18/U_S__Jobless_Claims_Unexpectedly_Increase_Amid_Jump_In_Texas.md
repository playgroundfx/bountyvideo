First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased
in the week ended March 13th, according to a report released by the
Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims climbed to 770,000, an increase
of 45,000 from the previous week's revised level of 725,000.

The rebound came as a surprise to economists, who had expected jobless
claims to edge down to 700,000 from the 712,000 originally reported for
the previous week.

The unexpected increase in jobless claims was partly due to jump in
claims in Texas due to the impact of Winter Storm Uri.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average dipped to 746,250, a decrease of 16,000 from the previous week's
revised average of 762,250.

The report said continuing claims, a reading on the number of people
receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, also edged down by 18,000 to
4.124 million in the week ended March 6th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims fell to 4,255,500, a
decrease of 99,000 from the previous week's revised average of
4,354,500.

"We expect a significant improvement in the labor market over the course
of 2021, with a total of 7 million jobs recovered over the course of the
year," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Nonetheless, the elevated level of claims - still higher
than the Global Financial Crisis peak - underscores why the Fed will be
extremely patient before making a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) change and not act pre-
emptively."
