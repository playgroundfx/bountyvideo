Turkey's central bank resorted to a bigger-than-expected rate hike on
Thursday, citing upside risks to inflation expectations.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey governed by Naci Agbal decided to lift the key one-week repo rate
sharply to 19.00 percent from 17.00 percent.

The bank had raised the rate by 475 basis points at the first MPC
meeting of Agbal as governor in November and by 200 basis points in the
subsequent meeting in December.

The tight monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance will be maintained decisively, taking
into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until
strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price
stability, the MPC said.

The tight stance will foster macroeconomic and financial stability
positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the
reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs, the bank said.

The bank is set to keep monetary conditions tighter than most expect
over the next couple of years, Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. That will provide a more supportive environment for the
lira.
