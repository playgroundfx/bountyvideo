Taiwan's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged, as widely
expected, and raised its growth projection citing robust exports and
investment.

Policymakers decided to hold the benchmark rate at a record low 1.125
percent.

Taiwan's export growth is expected to gather pace amid faster recoveries
across major economies and private investment to gain strength from
robust exports. Private consumption is forecast to grow moderately.

The central bank raised its 2021 economic growth outlook to 4.53 percent
from 3.7 percent.

The bank projected that consumer price inflation and core inflation
rates to be 1.07 percent and 0.77 percent, respectively, indicating a
mild inflation outlook.

With growth set to ease and inflation low, interest rates are likely to
remain unchanged for the rest of the year, Gareth Leather, an economist
at Capital Economics, said.
