Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers unanimously decided to keep its benchmark
rate and quantitative easing unchanged on Thursday as members were not
much concerned about higher gilt yields.

The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, headed by Governor Andrew
Bailey, voted to hold the interest rate at 0.10 percent and the
quantitative easing at GBP 895 billion in the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting.

All members of the MPC judged that the existing stance of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remained appropriate.

Members were more upbeat about the near term outlook since the previous
meeting. The committee observed that the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the near-term economic
activity had been positive, although the extent to which that [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
changed the medium-term outlook was less clear.

The bank added that the outlook for the [economy][1] remains unusually
uncertain. It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic,
measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses
and financial markets respond to these developments.

As previously estimated, inflation is expected to return swiftly to
around the 2 percent target in the spring, as the effects of those
earlier falls in oil prices drop out of the annual comparison, and
reflecting more recent increases in energy prices.

The committee said it did not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at least
until there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made
in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation
target sustainably.

If the outlook for inflation weakened, the committee stood ready to take
whatever additional action was necessary to achieve its remit, the bank
said.

The bank is not unduly fazed by either the rise in bond yields or the
noticeable increase in rate hike expectations that have occurred over
recent weeks, James Smith and Petr Krpata, economists at ING said.

Negative rates are unlikely in 2021 and instead there will be a growing
focus on tightening, though this process is not expected to start before
2023, they said.

Interest rates will not rise above their current rate of +0.10 percent
until 2026, said Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics.
