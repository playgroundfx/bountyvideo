European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Thursday that the
acceleration in buying bonds under its pandemic-era scheme will start to
show in the long term.  
  
At its latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session last Thursday, the Governing Council
decided to "significantly" accelerate the pace of its bond purchases
under the EUR 1,850 billion pandemic emergency purchase program, or
PEPP.

"While records of our weekly purchases will continue to be distorted by
short-term noisy factors - such as occasionally lumpy redemptions - the
step-up in the run-rate of our programme will become visible when
ascertained over longer time intervals," Lagarde said at a hearing in
the European Parliament.

The euro area economic outlook in the short term remains surrounded by
uncertainty and preserving favorable financing conditions over pandemic
period remains essential, the ECB chief said.  
  
Eurozone economic recovery is set to lag behind that of the U.S. as the
[coronavirus][1] vaccination rollout in the bloc is slow and the fiscal
support is relatively smaller. The recent suspension of the Oxford-
AstraZeneca vaccine has delayed the process further.

"While we believe that 2021 will be the year of the recovery, we don't
see it happening until the second half of 2021, and any yield increase
that may act as a bit of a brake would be undesirable," Lagarde told
lawmakers, echoing the sentiment from the recent [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session.  
  
ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers have already expressed concern over rising market
interest rates. The US Federal Reserve raised its macroeconomic
projections on Wednesday and forecast no rate hike until 2024. This
pushed up long-term treasury yields.  
  
"If sizeable and persistent, increases in those market interest rates,
when left unchecked, may become inconsistent with countering the
downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation,"
Lagarde said.

The ECB chief stressed the pressing need for decisive action in other
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) areas to support recovery.  
  
An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, the central
banker said. Stimulus measures must be designed to be temporary and
targeted to address vulnerabilities effectively, she added.
