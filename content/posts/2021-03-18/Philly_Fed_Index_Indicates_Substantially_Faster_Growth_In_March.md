A reading on Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity spiked to a nearly
50-year high in the month of March, the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia revealed in a report on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity soared to
51.8 in March from 23.1 in February, with a positive reading indicating
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to come in unchanged.

With the substantial increase, the Philly Fed Index skyrocketed to its
highest level since hitting 53.6 in April of 1973.
