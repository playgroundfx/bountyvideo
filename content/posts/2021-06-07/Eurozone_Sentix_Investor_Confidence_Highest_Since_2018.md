Euro area [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence rose for the fourth straight month in June
to its highest level in over three years as financial experts assessed
the current economic situation more favorably, survey data from the
behavioral research institute Sentix showed Monday.

The Sentix [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index for Eurozone climbed to 28.1 from
21.0 in May. Economists had expected a score of 26.

The latest reading was the highest since February 2018, the think tank
said.

The current situation index of the survey also rose for a fourth
straight month and surged to 21.3 from 6.3 in May. The reading was the
highest since November 2018.

However, the expectations measure of the survey dropped for the first
time in four months, dropping to 35.3 from 36.8 in the previous month.

The survey showed that the inflation barometer remains clearly negative
at -42.25 points, indicating that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect inflationary
pressures to persist.

"The Eurozone [economy][1] remains on track to leave the painful
consequences of the Corona year behind," Sentix Managing Director
Manfred Hubner said.

"The increasing openings of trade, restaurants and tourism are reviving
the situation scores."

The ample supply of liquidity provided by the European Central Bank is
also stimulating the economy.

The pressure on prices, and thus also on the bond [markets][2], is
likely to continue over the summer and the ECB will probably not be able
to avoid the discussion about turning away from its very expansionary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for much longer, Sentix said.

The central bank is set to hold its next [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session later this week.
Economists expect the bank to avoid any talk of tapering its stimulus
this time, but cannot hold on so for long.

The latest survey was conducted from June 3 to 5 among 1139 [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
of whom 222 were institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

In the biggest euro area economy, Germany, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index
rose for a fourth straight month to 32.9, the highest level since early
2018. The current situation measure climbed to its highest level since
early 2019, while expectations weakened.
