The services sector in Australia continues to expand in May, and at a
slightly faster pace, the latest survey from the Australian Industry
Group revealed on Monday with a seasonally adjusted Performance of
Services Index score of 61.2.

That's up from 61.0 in April, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This was the highest monthly result in the Australian PSIÂ® since October
2003.

Four of the five activity indicators - sales, new orders, employment and
deliveries - showed positive results in the month.
