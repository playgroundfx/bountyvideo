UK house prices increased at the fastest pace in nearly seven years in
May driven by the easing of national lockdown restrictions and the
gradual reopening of the housing market, data from Lloyds Bank
subsidiary Halifax and IHS Markit showed on Monday.  
  
House prices grew 9.5 percent year-on-year in May, following April's 8.2
percent rise. But this was slower than the 10 percent increase expected
by economists.

On a monthly basis, house price growth eased to 1.3 percent in May from
1.5 percent in April. Economists had forecast prices to climb 1.2
percent.

Average UK property prices rose to a record GBP 261,743 in May.

The current strength in house prices points to a deeper and long-lasting
change as buyer preferences shift in anticipation of new, post-pandemic
lifestyles - as greater demand for larger properties with more space
might warrant an increased willingness to spend a higher proportion of
income on housing, Russell Galley, Managing Director at Halifax, said.

These trends, coupled with growing confidence in economic activity
recovery if restrictions continue to be eased, are likely to support
house prices for some time to come, particularly given the continued
shortage of properties for sale, Galley added.
