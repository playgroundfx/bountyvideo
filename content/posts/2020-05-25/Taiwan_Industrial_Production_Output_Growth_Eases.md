expansion of 21.89 percent. Manufacturing output advanced 4.15 percent,
slower than the 11.93 percent rise a month ago.

Meanwhile, electricity and gas supply fell 5.35 percent and water supply
dropped 0.19 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production fell 7.4 percent and
manufacturing output slid 7.62 percent in April.
