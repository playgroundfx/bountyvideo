Finland's producer prices declined sharply in April largely driven by
fall in prices of oil products, data from Statistics Finland showed
Monday.

Producer prices decreased 7 percent year-on-year in April, faster than
the 5.6 percent decrease seen in March. Prices have been falling over
the last eleven months.

The drop in the producer prices was particularly driven by lower costs
of oil products, pulp, paper, paperboard and cardboard, as well as
electricity in April.

Producer prices in the domestic market declined 6.3 percent, and that of
exports fell 7.8 percent annually.

On a monthly basis, the decline in producer prices slowed to 1.4 percent
from 3 percent in March.

Data showed that import prices fell 3.3 percent on a monthly basis. At
the same time, prices declined 10.8 percent from the same period last
year.

Likewise, export prices decreased 1.3 percent on month and 7.8 percent
from last year.
