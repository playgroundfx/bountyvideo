The Czech Republic's economic sentiment improved slightly in May, after
a historic fall in the previous month, helped by a modest strengthening
in consumer morale as the shock from the [coronavirus][1] pandemic
started to ebb, survey data from the Czech Statistical Office showed on
Monday.  
  
The economic sentiment index climbed to 75.1 from 74.8 in April. The
consumer confidence indicator rose to 91.9 from 80.1 as households'
overall expectations for the coming months improved.  
  
The industrial confidence index also rose in May, to 72.9 from 72, on
expectations of higher production in coming months.

In contrast, the [business][2] confidence index fell in trade,
construction and services sectors.
