Belgium [business][1] confidence slightly recovered in May led by a
modest improvement in sentiment in the business-related services sector
as the lockdown restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the
coronavirus were partially eased, survey data from the National Bank of
Belgium showed on Monday.

The business confidence index rose to -34.4 from -36.1 in April.
Economists had forecast a score of -29.5.  
  
In April, the index had logged a record fall. Hence, the confidence
reading still remains extremely low.  
  
Sentiment largely stabilized in the trade sector, while it weakened in
construction and manufacturing.  
  
The employment outlook was largely unchanged in the trade sector, while
it was modestly revised upwards in manufacturing.
