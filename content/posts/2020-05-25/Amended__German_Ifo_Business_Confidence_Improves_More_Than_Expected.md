Corrects the first sentence in the third paragraph to reflect the fall
in the current conditions measure.

Germany's [business][1] confidence improved slightly more than expected
in May, as European countries partly began to withdraw lockdown

Covid-19, reports said Monday, citing survey data from the think tank

The ifo business confidence index climbed to 79.5 from 74.2 in April,
which was revised from 74.3. Economists had forecast a score of 78.3.

The current conditions index fell to 78.9 from 79.4 in April, which was
revised from 79.5. Economists had expected a reading of 80.

The expectations measure jumped to 80.1 from 69.4 in April. Economists
had expected a reading of 75.
