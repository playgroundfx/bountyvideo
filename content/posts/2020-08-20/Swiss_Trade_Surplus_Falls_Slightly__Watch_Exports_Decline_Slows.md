Switzerland's trade surplus fell slightly in July with both exports and
imports growing at slower rates, while the pace of decline in watch
exports eased sharply after poor performance in the previous few months
due to the impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic on global trade.

The trade surplus modestly decreased to CHF 2.58 billion from CHF 2.74
billion in June, data from the Swiss Federal Customs Administration
showed Thursday.

In real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports grew for a second straight month, up 2.3 percent
year-on-year after a 8.1 percent increase in the previous month. Imports
rose for a third month, up 1.1 percent following a 5.1 percent climb in
June.

The results remained sharply below the monthly levels in the same period
last year, the agency said.

Passenger car imports continued to gain traction and demand for
chemicals and pharmaceuticals increased.

Exports to Asia and North America grew by 5 percent each, the agency
said.

Elsewhere, data from the Federation of Swiss Watch Industry reported
that watch exports declined 17 percent year-on-year in July, which was
much slower than the 35.1 percent fall logged in June.

Demand from China posted a second consecutive month of very strong
growth, 59.1 percent, signaling the early recovery in this market and
the gradual resumption of domestic rather than foreign sales.

Exports to the United States were stable with a modest fall of 0.6
percent. Shipments to Hong Kong, Germany, Italy, France and Japan
decreased. Meanwhile, demand from the UK grew 2.5 percent.
