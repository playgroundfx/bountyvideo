Turkey's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the
third straight month, as expected.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, led by Governor Murat Uysal, decided to hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate,
which is the one-week repo auction rate, at 8.25 percent and to continue
liquidity measures.

The bank had reduced the rate four times so far this year. Last
reduction was in May, when the rate was cut by 50 basis points.

The bank said the monetary stance will be determined by considering the
indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation
of the disinflation process.

Economic recovery, which started in May following gradual steps towards
normalization, is gaining pace, the bank noted.

Policymakers observed that monetary and fiscal measures taken to contain
the negative effects of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic have helped
economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the
[economy][2].
