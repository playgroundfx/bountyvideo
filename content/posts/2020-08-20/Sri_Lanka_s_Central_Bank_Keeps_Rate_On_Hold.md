Sri Lanka's central bank left its key rates unchanged on Thursday after
cutting it by 100 basis points last month.

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka decided to hold the
Standing Deposit Facility Rate at 4.50 percent and the Standing Lending
Facility Rate at 5.50 percent.

The bank has reduced the interest rates five times so far this year. The
bank had slashed the rates by 100 basis points in July.

The board decided to adopt targeted measures to reduce specific interest
rates that it considered to be excessive, which would help marginal
borrowers.

The central bank expects the [economy][1] to recover in the second half
of the year.  
However, for sustaining the growth momentum beyond the near term would
require reforms to address structural issues in the economy, the bank
noted.

Inflation is forecast to remain broadly within the desired 4-6 percent
range in the near to medium term, with appropriate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures.

Given the poor outlook for the economy and mounting political pressure,
Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said the easing cycle
has further to run.

The economist expects 50 basis points of rate cuts for the remainder of
this year and another 50 basis points of cuts in 2021.
