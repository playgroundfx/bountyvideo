The Conference Board released a report on Thursday showing its leading
economic index for the U.S. increased for the third straight month in
July, although the pace growth by the index slowed from the two previous
months.

The report said the leading economic index jumped by 1.4 percent in July
after surging up by 3.0 percent in June and by 3.1 percent in May.

"Despite the recent gains in the LEI, which remain fairly broad-based,
the initial post-pandemic recovery appears to be losing steam," said
Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The
Conference Board.

He added, "The LEI suggests that the pace of economic growth will weaken
substantially during the final months of 2020."

The Conference Board said the coincident economic index climbed by 1.2
percent in July following a 2.9 percent spike in June.

Meanwhile, the lagging economic index fell by 1.0 percent in July after
tumbling by 2.3 percent in the previous month.
