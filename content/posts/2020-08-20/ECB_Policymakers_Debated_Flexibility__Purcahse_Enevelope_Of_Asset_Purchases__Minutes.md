European Central Bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers discussed the flexibility and target
of the bank's emergency bond purchases that were unveiled to support the
euro area [economy][1] amid the disruption caused by the coronavirus, or
Covid-19, pandemic, the minutes of the July 15-16 [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting showed
on Thursday.  
  
In July, the ECB Governing Council left its key interest rates and the
volume of its asset purchases unchanged as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers saw early signs
of a gradual economic recovery from the slump induced by the
[coronavirus][2] pandemic, but significant uncertainty regarding the
outlook.

The flexibility of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, or PEPP,
was highlighted as the key element of its effectiveness and efficiency
in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) transmission, the minutes, which the ECB calls "account",
showed.  
  
The minutes showed that some [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers wanted to fix the asset
purchase target for the EUR 1,350 billion PEPP as its ceiling, citing
better-than-expected data in recent weeks.  
  
"The argument was also made that the flexibility of the PEPP suggested
that the net purchase envelope should be considered a ceiling rather
than a target," the minutes said.  
  
"The point was made that incoming data had surprised on the upside and
some of the downside risks surrounding the outlook prevailing at the
time of the Governing Council's June monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting had
receded, increasing the possibility that the envelope might not have to
be deployed fully."

However, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers agreed that the PEPP envelope would have to be
used in full, based the latest economic assessment of ECB staff and in
the absence of any major upside surprises to the medium-term outlook.  
  
Policymakers also stressed on the importance of effective communication
at this juncture and underlined that the Governing Council should "avoid
creating new expectations of further monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action", but "it
should also emphasize that it had the tools and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) space to take
further action if needed."
