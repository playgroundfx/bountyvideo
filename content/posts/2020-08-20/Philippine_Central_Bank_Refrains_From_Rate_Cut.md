The Philippine central bank refrained from cutting rates further from
the current record low as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers await the real impact of previous
easing on the [economy][1].

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, or BSP, on
Thursday, retained the overnight reverse repurchase facility rate at a
record low 2.25 percent.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
also kept unchanged at 1.75 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively.

The bank had reduced its key rate by 50 basis points each in June, April
and March and by 25 basis points in February.

The central bank said today's decision was based on its assessment that
the inflation environment remains benign.

"The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also leans toward the
downside from 2020 until 2022 owing largely to potential disruptions to
domestic and global economic activity amid the ongoing pandemic," the
bank said.

Today's decision likely marks a pause rather than an end to the easing
cycle, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Inflation is no barrier to further easing. While the headline rate has
risen in recent months, to 2.7 percent in July, it is still below the
mid-point of the BSP's 2-4 percent target band, the economist noted.

In the second quarter, the economy had entered a recession after the
gross domestic product contracted at the fastest pace since 1981. Gross
domestic product fell 16.5 percent on a yearly basis.
