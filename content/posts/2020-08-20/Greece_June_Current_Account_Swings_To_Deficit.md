Greece's current account deficit swung to a deficit in June this year
versus a surplus last year, mainly due to the deterioration in travel
and services balances, the Bank of Greece said Thursday.

The current account showed a deficit of EUR 1.4 billion versus a surplus
of EUR 805 million in June last year.

"This development is mainly attributable to a deterioration in the
travel balance and, therefore, the services balance, which was partly
offset by an improvement in the balance of goods, as imports of goods
decreased more than the respective exports," the bank said.

Meanwhile, the primary and the secondary income accounts did not show
any significant change, the bank added.

In theÂ first half of the year, the current account deficit rose by EUR
2.9 billion year-on-year to EUR 7.0 billion.
