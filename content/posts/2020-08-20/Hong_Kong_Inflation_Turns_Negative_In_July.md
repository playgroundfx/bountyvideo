Hong Kong's consumer price inflation turned negative in July due to the
government's public housing rental payments, the Census and Statistics
Department showed Thursday.

Consumer prices fell 2.3 percent on a yearly basis in July, reversing a
0.7 percent rise in June.

The decrease in July was mainly due to the government's payment of
public housing rentals and waiver of two-thirds of rent for tenants of
Group B estates by Hong Kong Housing Society in July 2020.

Netting out the effects of government measures, underlying inflation
slowed to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent in June. The smaller increase in
July was mainly due to the decreases in the costs for meals bought away
from home and the enlarged decreases in local transport fares.

Underlying inflation eased as economic conditions remained very weak
amid the covid-19 pandemic, government spokesman said.

Looking ahead, both external and internal price pressures should remain
subdued in the rest of the year amid the weak global and local economic
conditions, the spokesman added. The government will continue to monitor
the inflation situation and the risk of deflation closely.
