A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed regional manufacturing activity continued to expand in
the month of August, although the pace of growth slowed by more than
anticipated.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity dropped to
17.2 in August from 24.1 in July, but a positive reading still indicates
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to dip to 21.0.

Looking ahead, the survey's future indexes suggest that respondents
continue to expect growth in manufacturing activity over the next six
months.
