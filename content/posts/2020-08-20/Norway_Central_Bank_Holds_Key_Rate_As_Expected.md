Norway's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at zero, as
widely expected, on Thursday, after a surprise cut in May.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee unanimously
decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at zero percent, Norges Bank said in a
statement.

In May, the rate was cut from 0.25 percent after a cumulative 125 basis
points reduction in two extraordinary sessions in March from 1.50
percent.

The bank reiterated that the interest rates are set to remain unchanged
over the next couple of years, followed by a gradual rise.

"The Committee's assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests
that the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely remain at today's level for some
time ahead", Governor Oystein Olsen, said.

The bank noted that activity has picked up in recent months but remained
lower than prior to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

Unemployment remained high despite a decline. Underlying inflation
stayed above the inflation target. The krone appreciation and prospects
for low wage growth suggest that inflation will moderate further out,
the bank said.
