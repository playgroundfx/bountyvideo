Eurozone's construction output growth sharply slowed in June, after a
strong recovery in May following three months of steep declines, data
from Eurostat showed on Thursday.

Construction output rose 4 percent from May, when it surged 29.4
percent, revised from 27.9 percent.

June was a month marked by some relaxation of COVID-19 containment
measures in many Member States, Eurostat said.

Output started falling from February and logged double-digit declines in
March and April when the [economy][1] was ravaged by the coronavirus, or
Covid-19, pandemic.

In June, building construction increased 4.5 percent and civil
engineering grew 2.3 percent. Both had grown more than 28 percent each
in May.

Compared to the same month last year, Euro area construction output
decreased for a fifth straight month. Output fell 5.9 percent after a
10.5 percent decline in May.

In the EU, construction output increased 2.9 percent month-on-month
after a 22.3 percent growth in the previous month. Building rose 3.2
percent and civil engineering grew 1.8 percent.

Among member states, the biggest increases were recorded in France,
Hungary and Bulgaria, while the largest falls were seen in Slovenia,
Sweden and Slovakia.
