Malaysia's industrial production declined sharply in April due to the
measures taken to prevent the spread of [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19,
pandemic, data from the Department of Statistics showed on Thursday.

Industrial production fell 32.0 percent year-on-year in April, following
a 4.9 percent decrease in March. Economists had expected an 18.0 percent
decline.

Manufacturing output declined 37.2 percent in April, following a 4.1
percent fall in the previous month.

Among other sectors, mining and quarrying output decreased 19.6 percent
and electricity output fell 19.2 percent.

The Industrial Production Index is expected to improve in the coming
months, as the government allowed more industries to resume operations
in May, the agency said.
