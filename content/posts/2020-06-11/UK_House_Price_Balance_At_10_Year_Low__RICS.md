The UK house price indicator moved deeper into negative territory in May
amid [coronavirus][1] pandemic, survey data from the Royal Institution
of Chartered Surveyors, or RICS, showed Thursday.

The house price balance fell to -32 percent in May from -22 percent in
April. This was the weakest monthly figure since 2010.

Moreover, near-term price expectations remained downbeat, with the index
standing at -43 percent. Further, a net -16 percent forecast prices to
fall over the year ahead.  
  
The survey showed that there was a slight improvement in the sales
outlook as estate agents were permitted to reopen on May 13.
Nonetheless, given the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic,
overall sentiment remained cautions.

The net balance for new buyer enquiries rose to -5 percent in May from a
record low of -94 percent in April.

Despite a net balance of -20 percent of contributors reporting that new
instructions coming onto the market continued to fall in May, this was
noticeably less negative compared to the reading of -97 percent last
month, RICS said.

Further, the net balance for near term sales expectations advanced to -4
percent from -58 percent in April.
