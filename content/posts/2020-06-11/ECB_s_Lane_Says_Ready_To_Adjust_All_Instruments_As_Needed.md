The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all its instruments as
needed to support the euro area [economy][1] during the severe crisis
triggered by the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic, the European
Central Bank Executive Board member and Chief Economist Philip Lane
said.

The central bank is ready to adjust its key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate, which is the
deposit rate that is currently at -0.50 percent, Lane said in an
interview to the Il Sole 24 Ore [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)paper.  
  
The interview text was published on the ECB [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) on Thursday.  
  
The previous change in the deposit rate was a reduction in September
2016.  
  
"In the current environment of exceptional uncertainty and remaining
stress in financial [markets][2], asset purchases within the PEPP have
proven a particularly effective tool, so we focused on these in our most
recent decision," Lane said.
