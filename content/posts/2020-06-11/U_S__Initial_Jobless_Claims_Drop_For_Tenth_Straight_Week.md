With businesses reopening following the [coronavirus][1] lockdown, the
Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a continued
decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended June 6th.

The report said initial jobless claims tumbled to 1.542 million, a
decrease of 355,000 from the previous week's revised level of 1.897
million.

Economists had expected jobless claims to slump to 1.550 million from
the 1.877 million originally reported for the previous week.

Jobless claims declined for the tenth straight week after reaching a
record high of 6.867 million in the week ended March 28th.

Nonetheless, the number of new claims for unemployment benefits since
the coronavirus lockdown now exceeds 44 million.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also dropped to 2,002,000, a decrease of 286,250 from the previous
week's revised average of 2,288,250.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also slid by 339,000 to 20.929 million in the
week ended May 30th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims fell to 21,987,500, a
decrease of 404,750 from the previous week's revised average of
22,392,250.

With jobless claims still at an elevated level, Paul Ashworth, Chief
U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said it is "hard to square the
claims figures with the much more upbeat [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the labor market from
May's Employment Report."

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report
unexpectedly showing a substantial rebound in employment in the month of
May.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 2.51
million jobs in May after plummeting by a revised 20.69 million jobs in
April.

The record spike in employment came as a shock to economists, who had
expected the loss of another 8.0 million jobs following the nosedive of
20.5 million jobs originally reported for the previous month.

Employment rose sharply in leisure and hospitality, construction,
education and [health][2] services, and retail trade, according to the
Labor Department.

With the unexpected rebound in employment, the Labor Department said the
unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent in May from 14.7 percent in
April. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to surge up to 19.8
percent.
