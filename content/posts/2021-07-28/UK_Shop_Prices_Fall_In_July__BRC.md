UK shop prices continued to decline in July, largely driven by a steep
fall in non-food prices, the British Retail Consortium, said on
Wednesday.  
  
The shop price index dropped 1.2 percent on a yearly basis in July,
after easing 0.7 percent in June.

Annual prices in July fell at a faster rate than the previous month due
to fierce competition between supermarkets keeping food prices low, and
the steeper 1.8 percent fall in non-food prices.

Unfortunately for consumers, low prices may not last forever, Helen
Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

Recently, retailers have faced huge cost pressures as a result of rising
costs of shipping, haulage and petrol as well as frictions from exiting
the EU, said Dickinson. The additional paperwork and physical checks on
EU imports in October and January may push prices up in the long-term.
