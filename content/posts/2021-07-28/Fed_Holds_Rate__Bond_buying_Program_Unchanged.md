The Federal Open Market Committee, which concluded its two-day monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting Wednesday afternoon, left the target range for its
federal funds rate unchanged at 0 to 0.25 percent, and said it will
continue with its $120 billion-a-month bond-buying program.

The move by the central bank is in line with expectations. The bank,
which said the [economy][1] is strengthening despite concerns over the
spread of the coronavirus, stressed that progress on vaccinations will
likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the
economy. However, it added that risks to the economic outlook remain.

"The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown
improvement but have not fully recovered" noted the central bank's post-
meeting statement. "Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory
factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part
reflecting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures to support the economy and the flow of credit
to U.S. households and businesses."

Noting that there has been progress towards the central bank's goals on
employment and inflation, the bank's statement says changes to [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
with regard to monthly bond purchases could be on the way.

The central bank's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers have approved the creation of a standing
repo facility for the bond market where institutions go to exchange
high-quality collateral for cash.

The Fed said the open market committee will continue to assess progress
in coming meetings.
