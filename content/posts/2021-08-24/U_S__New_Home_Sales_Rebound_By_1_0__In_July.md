The Commerce Department released a report on Tuesday showing a rebound
in U.S. new home sales in the month of July.

The report showed new home sales increased by 1.0 percent to an annual
rate of 708,000 in July after slumping by 2.6 percent to an upwardly
revised rate of 701,000 in June.

Economists had expected new home sales to jump by 3.6 percent to a rate
of 700,000 from the 676,000 originally reported for the previous month.

While new home sales in June were upwardly revised, the annual rate
still represented the lowest level since April of last year.

The increase in new home sales came as new home sales in the West
skyrocketed by 14.4 percent to an annual rate of 215,000.

New home sales in the South also climbed by 1.3 percent, while new home
sales in the Northeast and Midwest plummeted by 24.1 percent and 20.2
percent, respectively.

The Commerce Department also said the median sales price of new houses
sold in July was $390,500, up 5.5 percent from $370,200 in June and up
18.4 percent from $329,800 a year ago.

The estimate of new houses for sale at the end of July was 367,000,
representing a supply of 6.2 months at the current sales rate.

"While demand for new homes remains strong, high prices and backlogs in
construction will temper sales in the months ahead," said Nancy Vanden
Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

On Monday, the National Association of Realtors released a separate
report showing existing home sales jumped by 2.0 percent to an annual
rate of 5.99 million in July.
