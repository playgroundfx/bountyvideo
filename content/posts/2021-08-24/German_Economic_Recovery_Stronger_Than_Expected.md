Germany's [economy][1] grew at a faster than expected pace in the second
quarter, underpinned by domestic demand, after contracting in the first
three months of the year, latest data from Destatis showed Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew a seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)-adjusted 1.6
percent from the first quarter, when output decreased 2.0 percent. An
increase of 1.5 percent was estimated initially.  
  
In the second quarter of 2020, GDP fell 10 percent amid the peak of the
Covid-19 pandemic.  
  
Destatis said, economic output was still 3.3 percent lower compared to
the 4th quarter of 2019, the quarter before the start of the
[coronavirus][2] crisis.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, GDP grew 9.8 percent in the second quarter
after a 3.3 percent fall in the first quarter. Growth was estimated as
9.2 percent in the flash estimate.  
  
As the lockdown restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic were
increasingly relaxed, consumption picked up.  
  
Private consumption grew 3.2 percent from the first quarter and the
state spending increased 1.8 percent.  
  
Investments in both machinery and equipment as well as construction grew
0.3 percent each.  
  
Exports rose 0.5 percent and imports increased 2.1 percent.

Gross value added in services increased, while that in industry
declined. Construction registered a modest gain.  
  
"The rebound of the German economy was weaker than in many other
eurozone countries as the manufacturing sector suffered from supply
chain problems," ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.  
  
"Looking ahead, three factors will determine the outlook for the German
economy: the Delta variant, supply chain frictions and inflation," the
economist added.  
  
ING continues to expect the German economy to return to per-crisis
levels before the end of the year.  
  
The number of employed rose by 4,000 persons from a year ago, almost
unchanged in percentage [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) after a 1.5 percent annual fall in the
first quarter, Destatis said.
