Manufacturing activity in the U.S. unexpectedly grew at a slightly
faster rate in the month of August, the Institute for Supply Management
revealed in a report on Wednesday.

The ISM said its manufacturing PMI inched up to 59.9 in August from 59.5
in July, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the sector. The
uptick surprised economists, who had expected the index to dip to 58.6.

The unexpected increase by the headline index came as the new orders
index climbed to 66.7 in August from 64.9 in July and the production
index rose to 60.0 from 58.4 in the previous month.

Meanwhile, the report showed the employment index slid to 49.0 in August
from 52.9 in July, indicating a modest contraction in employment in the
manufacturing sector.

The prices index also slumped to 79.4 in August from 85.7 in July,
pointing to a slowdown in the pace of price growth.

While the manufacturing PMI unexpectedly edged higher, Timothy R. Fiore,
Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee noted companies
and suppliers continue to struggle at unprecedented levels to meet
increasing demand.

"All segments of the manufacturing [economy][1] are impacted by record-
long raw-materials lead times, continued shortages of critical basic
materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting
products," Fiore said.

He added, "The new surges of COVID-19 are adding to pandemic-related
issues — worker absenteeism, short-term shutdowns due to parts
shortages, difficulties in filling open positions and overseas supply
chain problems — that continue to limit manufacturing-growth potential.

However, Fiore also noted optimistic panel sentiment remained strong,
with eight positive comments for every cautious comment.

On Friday, the ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on activity
in the service sector in the month of August. The services PMI is
expected to drop to 61.6 in August from 64.1 in July.
