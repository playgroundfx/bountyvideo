Germany's retail sales declined more-than-expected in July after two
months of straight growth, data published by Destatis revealed on
Wednesday.

Retail sales decreased by real 5.1 percent month-on-month in July,
reversing June's revised 4.5 percent increase. Sales were forecast to
fall moderately by 0.9 percent.

Destatis said retail turnover logged a notable growth in June because of
the lifting of restrictions related to the pandemic.

On a yearly basis, retail sales dropped unexpectedly by 0.3 percent in
July, in contrast to the 6.5 percent expansion posted a month ago.
Economists had forecast an annual growth of 3.7 percent.

Food, beverages and tobacco sales were down 1 percent annually, while
non-food sales remained flat in July.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales decreased 4.5 percent from June but
increased 1.7 percent from the same period last year.
