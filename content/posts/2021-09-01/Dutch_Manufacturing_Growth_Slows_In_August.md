The Netherlands' manufacturing sector growth slowed in August, but the
pace of expansion remained strong, survey results from IHS Markit showed
on Wednesday.

The NEVI manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, decreased to
65.8 in August from 67.4 in July. Any reading above 50.0 indicates
expansion in the sector.

New order growth eased in August, was the sixth-highest since the survey
began in 2000. New [business][1] increased sharply and output growth
eased for the tenth time in eleven months.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in August and backlogs of work
increased at the fourth-fastest rate on record.

For the next 12 months output expectations strengthened in August, with
overall sentiment highest since May.

Input price inflation eased in August and output prices continued to
increase sharply.

"The new lockdowns have led to the closure of production plants for
electronics and microchips and major export ports in China," David
Kemps, sector banker manufacturing at ABN AMRO, said.
