Turkey's [economy][1] managed to expand in the second quarter despite
tight restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, data
released by the Turkish Statistical Institute showed on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product grew by adjusted 0.9 percent sequentially, much
slower than the 2.2 percent increase seen in the first quarter.

GDP advanced 21.7 percent on a yearly basis, bigger than the first
quarter's 7.2 percent expansion. This was the fourth consecutive growth
in GDP. Calendar-adjusted GDP was up 21.9 percent from the last year.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household expenditure
increased 22.9 percent and government spending advanced 4.2 percent
annually. At the same time, gross fixed capital formation surged 20.3
percent.

Exports of goods and services climbed 59.9 percent in the second quarter
and imports of goods and services were up 19.2 percent.

The further expansion in the second quarter came despite a severe third
wave of COVID-19 that forced the government to tighten restrictions and
impose a three-week lockdown in May, Jason Tuvey, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

Robust growth and high inflation mean the central bank will hold off
cutting rates until late this year, the economist noted.
