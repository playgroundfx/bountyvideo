The manufacturing sector in the Philippines fell into contraction in
August, the latest report from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday with
a manufacturing PMI score of 46.4.

That's down from 50.4 in July, and it falls beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The re-introduction of Enhanced Quarantine Measures (ECQ) in Metro
Manilla forced factory and [business][1] closures in one of the
Philippines largest manufacturing regions in August. Output and new
orders fell sharply, although the rates of decline were not as severe as
those seen during the first lockdown in March-May 2020.

Nevertheless, weak demand led to cost saving efforts and the consequent
reduction in inventory levels and employment in August. Meanwhile,
virus-related restrictions weighed heavily on lead times with port
congestions and material shortages again a key theme in the latest
survey period.
