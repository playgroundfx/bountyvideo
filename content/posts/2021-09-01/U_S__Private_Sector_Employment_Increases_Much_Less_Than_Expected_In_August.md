Private sector employment in the U.S. increased by much less than
expected in the month of August, according to a report released by
payroll processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment climbed by 374,000 jobs in August
after rising by a downwardly revised 326,000 jobs in July.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 613,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 330,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

"The Delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have dented the job market
recovery," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "Job
growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months."
