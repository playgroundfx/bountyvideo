The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to contract in August,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest report from Markit Economics showed
on Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 43.7.

That's up from 40.1 in July, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Ongoing COVID-19 disruptions for the Indonesian [economy][1] weighed on
the manufacturing sector for a second consecutive month in August. That
said, with the second COVID-19 wave having peaked, the declines in
production and demand eased from the severe rates seen in July.

Manufacturers nevertheless remained cautious with their purchases and
employment. Disruptions around production also kept backlogs and price
pressures building in August.
