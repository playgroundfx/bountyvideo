Greece's manufacturing activity increased in August, survey results from
IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 59.3 in August from
57.4 in July. A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

New sales increased in August and new export orders increased at the
sharpest rate.

The rate of inflation was the steepest since the survey began in May
1999. Input prices increased in August and output charges rose.

The number of workforce increased in August and the rate of backlogs of
work softened to the slowest in three months.

Output expectation for the next 12 months improved in August, with the
hopes of further increase in client demand.
