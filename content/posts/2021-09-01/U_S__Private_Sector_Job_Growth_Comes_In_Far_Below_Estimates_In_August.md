Private sector employment in the U.S. increased by much less than
expected in the month of August, according to a report released by
payroll processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment climbed by 374,000 jobs in August
after rising by a downwardly revised 326,000 jobs in July.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 613,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 330,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

"The Delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have dented the job market
recovery," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "Job
growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months."

Service providers continued to lead the job growth in August, with
employment in the sector climbing by 329,000 jobs. Employment in the
leisure/hospitality industry saw a notable increase of 201,000 jobs.

ADP said employment in the goods-producing sector also rose by 45,000
jobs during the month, partly reflecting the addition of 30,000
construction jobs.

The report also showed small businesses added 86,000 jobs, while
employment at large and midsized businesses increased by 138,000 jobs
and 149,000 jobs, respectively.

"Our data, which represents all workers on a company's payroll, has
highlighted a downshift in the labor market recovery," said ADP chief
economist Nela Richardson. "We have seen a decline in new hires,
following significant job growth from the first half of the year."

She added, "Despite the slowdown, job gains are approaching 4 million
this year, yet still 7 million jobs short of pre-COVID-19 levels."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly jobs report, which includes both public and private
sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 750,000 jobs in August
after surging by 943,000 jobs in July. The unemployment rate is expected
to dip to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent.
