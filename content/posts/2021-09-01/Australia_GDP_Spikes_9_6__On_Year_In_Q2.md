Australia's gross domestic product expanded 9.6 percent on year in the
second quarter of 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Wednesday.

That beat forecasts for a gain of 9.2 percent following the 1.1 percent
increase in the previous three months.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, gross domestic product was up
0.7 percent - again exceeding expectations for an increase of 0.5
percent after rising 1.8 percent in the three months prior.

Capital Expenditure was up 3.2 percent on quarter, slowing from 4.7
percent in the first quarter.
