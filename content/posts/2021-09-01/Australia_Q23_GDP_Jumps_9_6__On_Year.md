Australia's gross domestic product climbed 9.6 percent on year in the
second quarter of 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Wednesday.

That beat forecasts for a gain of 9.2 percent following the 1.1 percent
increase in the previous three months.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, gross domestic product was up
0.7 percent - again exceeding expectations for an increase of 0.5
percent after rising 1.8 percent in the three months prior.

Capital Expenditure was up 3.2 percent on quarter, slowing from 4.7
percent in the first quarter.

Lockdowns had minimal impact on activity overall, with fewer lockdown
days and the more prolonged stay-at-home orders in NSW only commencing
in the last week of June.

The [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trade rose 7.0 percent this quarter and is now at its
highest level in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Strong export prices for mining commodities
drove the quarterly rise. The strength in the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trade contributed
to a 3.2 percent increase in nominal GDP.

The domestic [economy][1] drove growth, contributing 1.6 percentage
points to the rise in GDP. Both private and public demand increased, led
by household spending (+1.1 percent) and public investment (+7.4
percent).

Household expenditure rose 1.1 percent this quarter but remained 0.3
percent below December quarter 2019 pre-pandemic levels.

Spending on services (+1.3 percent) drove the quarterly rise. Transport
services (+25.4 percent) and hotels, cafes and restaurants (+2.2
percent) continued to rebound reflecting increased tourism activity.
Spending on services remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly
those impacted by the ongoing closure of international borders.

Spending on goods rose 0.9 percent and is at elevated levels. Purchase
of vehicles rose 7.5 percent, reflecting continued strong demand and
increased supply of vehicles for purchase this quarter.

Household spending rose across all states this quarter. Victoria (+0.1
percent) recorded the weakest rise with spending impacted by a two-week
lockdown starting at the end of May.

New South Wales recorded the strongest growth amongst the states of 2.1
percent. Stay-at-home orders in NSW commenced in late June and did not
have a significant impact on spending this quarter.

Public investment rose 7.4 percent, driven by state and local government
infrastructure projects.

Private investment rose 2.0 percent. Both housing and [business][2]
investment increased, supported by government initiatives and increased
confidence. Ownership transfer costs increased 10.0 percent, the fourth
consecutive rise, reflecting low interest rates and confidence in the
housing market.
