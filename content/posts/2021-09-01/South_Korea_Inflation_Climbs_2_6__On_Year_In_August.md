Consumer prices in South Korea were up 2.6 percent on year in August,
Statistics Korea said on Thursday.

That was unchanged from the July reading, although it exceeded
expectations for 2.3 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.6 percent - also beating
forecasts for 0.3 percent and up from 0.2 percent in the previous month.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, rose 0.3 percent on month
and 1.3 percent on year after gaining 0.4 percent on month and 1.2
