South Korea's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.8
percent on quarter in the second quarter of 2021, the Bank of Korea said
in Thursday's final reading.

That was up from 0.7 percent in July's advance estimate and it follows
the 1.7 percent in the previous three months.

On an annualized basis, GDP was up 6.0 percent - again marking a slight
upward revision from 5.9 percent in the advance estimate. That's up
sharply from 1.9 percent in the first quarter.

Real gross national income increased by 0.1 percent in the second
quarter compared to the previous quarter.
