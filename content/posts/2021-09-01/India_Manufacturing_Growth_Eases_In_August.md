India's manufacturing sector grew at a softer pace in August in the
backdrop of a second wave of [coronavirus][1] infections and surging
costs, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to
52.3 in August from 55.3 in July.

Economists had forecast a score of 55. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

Production and new orders rose for the second straight month, but at
slower rates. New export orders increased at a slower pace in August.

Raw material shortage and transport problems led to further increase in
input costs thus stretching the latest sequence to 13 months. The rate
of output price inflation quickened to the highest in three months as
manufacturers passed on the increased costs to clients.

Backlogs of work decreased in August and employment levels were broadly
stagnant.

The 12-month outlook for production remained positive and the overall
degree of optimism weakened from July.

"August saw a continuation of the Indian manufacturing sector recovery,
but growth lost momentum as demand showed some signs of weakness due to
the pandemic," Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS
Markit, said.
