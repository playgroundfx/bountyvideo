Turkey's manufacturing activity increased marginally in August, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline Istanbul Chamber of Industry Turkey manufacturing
Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.1 in August from 54.0 in July. Any
reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

Business conditions strengthened for the third straight month in August
and new orders increased further.

New export [business][1] increased sharply in August and production grew
for the third month in a row.

Purchasing activity and employment increased in August. Backlogs of work
remained unchanged for the second consecutive month.

Input prices and output costs increased in August. Inflationary pressure
eased during the month.

"Firms will be hoping that some of these constraints start to ease over
the course of the rest of the year so that their full growth potential
can be realized," Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
