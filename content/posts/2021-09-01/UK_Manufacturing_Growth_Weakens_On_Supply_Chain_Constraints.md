UK manufacturers reported a slower growth in August amid rising
constraints caused by supply chain issues, final survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Wednesday.

The final IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply
Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a five-month low of 60.3, a tick
below July's 60.4. The flash reading was 60.1.

Manufacturing output increased again in August, albeit to the weakest
extent since February. Incoming new [business][1] expanded, reflecting
increased inflows from both domestic and overseas markets.

Confidence among manufacturers rose to a three-month high on
expectations of continued economic revival, stronger global demand,
investment plans and hopes that current supply issues would either
lessen or even be fully resolved.

Data showed that employment rose for the eighth month in a row and to
one of the greatest extents in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Price inflationary pressures continued to build in the manufacturing
sector. Average purchase prices rose at the fourth-fastest rate in the
survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Manufacturers were able to pass on a part of the
increase in costs to clients in August.

"A wide range of factors contributed to the disruption, including port
capacity issues, international shipping delays, the re-imposition of
COVID restrictions at some key points in global supply networks and
ongoing issues post-Brexit," Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said.

With all of these factors likely to persist for the foreseeable future,
manufacturing could well see a further growth slowdown in the coming
months, Dobson added.
