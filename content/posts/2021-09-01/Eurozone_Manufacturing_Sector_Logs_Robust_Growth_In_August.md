The euro area manufacturing logged another strong growth in August but
the pace of momentum waned as supply issues weighed on production, final
data from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a six-month
low of 61.4 in August from 62.8 in July. The flash reading was 61.5.

This marked a second successive month in which growth has slowed in the
sector since June's survey record expansion.

Goods production across the eurozone continued to expand in August but
the pace of growth was the weakest in six months. At the same time,
total new orders increased for a fourteenth straight month in August.

To boost output capabilities, manufacturers added to their workforce
numbers in August.

On the price front, the survey showed that price pressures remained
stubbornly elevated midway through the third quarter.

Input costs increased substantially further amid ongoing supply chain
issues and strong input demand. Output charges also remained
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly high but eased for the first time since January.

Business sentiment was strong, but eased for the second consecutive
month to reach its lowest since November 2020.

Among big-four member countries, softer expansions were recorded in
Germany and France. Meanwhile, Italy and Spain observed accelerated
expansions in August.

Germany's manufacturing activity grew at the slowest pace in six months
in August as supply shortages constrain production. The headline IHS
Markit/BME final manufacturing PMI came in at 62.6 in August, down from
65.9 in July. The latest reading was marginally below the flash 62.7.

Despite the headline index falling to its lowest level in six months,
the French manufacturing sector remained in robust growth territory in
August. The final factory PMI fell to 57.5 from 58.0 in the previous
month. The flash reading was 57.3.

Italy's manufacturing sector expanded for the fourteenth successive
month in August and the latest growth was the third highest on record.
The corresponding index rose to 60.9 from 60.3 in the prior month. The
expected score was 60.1.

Likewise, Spain's factory growth accelerated in August on strong
expansion in new orders and production. The manufacturing PMI ticked up
to 59.5 in August from 59.0 in July.
