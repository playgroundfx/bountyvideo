UK inflation slowed to a three-month low in March on falling fuel and
clothing prices ahead of the [coronavirus][1] lockdown, data from the
Office for National Statistics showed Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation eased to 1.5 percent from 1.7 percent in
February. This was the lowest rate since last December, when prices rose
1.3 percent. The rate came in line with expectations.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices remained flat after climbing 0.4
percent in February.

Excluding food and energy, core inflation slowed marginally to 1.6
percent from 1.7 percent a month ago.

Prices of clothing and footwear were down 1.2 percent. Petrol prices
fell to the lowest level in more than a year in March.

The ONS said prices were collected around March 17, before the formal
government lockdown was introduced on March 23.

As people spend more time at home, there might have been less interest
in clothing and there was a shift in spending patterns towards
necessities such as food and cleaning products.

Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker Silvana Tenreyro said last week that it is
difficult to interpret inflation data during Covid-19. She forecast
inflation to fall below 1 percent in the next couple of months, well
below the central bank's 2 percent target.

In March, inflation took the first leg of what is suspected to be a
sustained journey down to around 0.5 percent by the summer, Andrew
Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Another report from the ONS showed that output price inflation slowed to
0.3 percent in March from 0.5 percent in February, largely due to
petroleum product prices. Economists had forecast a marginal 0.1 percent
rise.

On a monthly basis, output prices decreased 0.2 percent for the second
straight month compared to a forecast of 0.3 percent fall.

At the same time, input prices declined 2.9 percent annually, much
faster than the 0.2 percent drop seen in February. This was the lowest
rate since October 2019. Nonetheless, this was slower than the expected
3.2 percent fall.

Month-on-month, input prices were down 3.6 percent versus the forecast
of -3.5 percent and February's 0.9 percent decrease.

In a separate release, the ONS said house price growth eased to 1.1
percent in February from 1.5 percent in January.

The statistical office said data collection for February was largely
unaffected by the COVID-19. There was a general slowdown in house price
growth over the last three years, the ONS noted.
