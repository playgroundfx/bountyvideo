Eurozone's consumer confidence weakened for a second straight month in
April to reach near its record lows seen during the global financial
crisis in 2009, amid the lockdown triggered by the spread of the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic.  
  
The flash consumer confidence index dropped to -22.7 from -11.6 in
March, preliminary figures from the European Commission showed on
Tuesday. Economists had expected a score of -19.6.  
  
The consumer confidence index for EU fell to -22 from -10.4 in the
previous month.  
  
Both indicators fell to well below their long-term averages of -11.1 and
-10.4, respectively.  
  
They are now close to the record lows recorded during the Great
Recession in 2009, the EU said.  
  
The final figures for April would be released along with the full
[business][2] and consumer survey results on April 29.
