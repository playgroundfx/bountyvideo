UK inflation slowed to a three-month low in March, data from the Office
for National Statistics showed Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation eased to 1.5 percent in March from 1.7 percent
in February. This was the lowest rate since last December, when prices
were up 1.3 percent. The rate came in line with expectations.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices remained flat after climbing 0.4
percent in February.

Excluding food and energy, core inflation slowed marginally to 1.6
percent from 1.7 percent a month ago.

Another report from the ONS showed that output price inflation slowed to
0.3 percent in March from 0.5 percent in February. Economists had
forecast a marginal 0.1 percent rise.

On a monthly basis, output prices decreased 0.2 percent for the second
straight month compared to a forecast of 0.3 percent fall.

At the same time, input prices declined 2.9 percent annually, much
faster than the 0.2 percent drop seen in February. This was the lowest
the rate since October 2019. Nonetheless, this was slower than the
expected 3.2 percent fall.

Month-on-month, input prices were down 3.6 percent versus forecast of
-3.5 percent and February's 0.9 percent decrease.
