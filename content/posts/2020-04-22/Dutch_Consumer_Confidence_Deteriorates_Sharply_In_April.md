Dutch consumer confidence declined sharply in April due to
[coronavirus][1] outbreak, data from the Central Bureau of Statistics
showed on Wednesday.

The consumer confidence index fell to -22 in April from -2 in March.
This was the largest decline ever.  
  
The consumer confidence index was far below the 20-year average of -5
points.

The economic climate sub-index decreased to -31 in April from 8 in the
previous month and the indicator for willingness to buy dropped to -17.

Households' assessment regarding their financial situation for the next
12 months deteriorated notably. However, consumers felt that it was less
favorable to make large purchases.

Another report from the statistical office showed that household
spending growth increased in February with higher purchases of home
furnishing and electrical appliances.

Consumer spending grew 1.1 percent annually in February, after a 0.9
percent increase in January.
