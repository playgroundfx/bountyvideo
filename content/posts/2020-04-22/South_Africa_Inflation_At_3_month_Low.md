South Africa's consumer price inflation eased to a three-month low in
March, figures from Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 4.1 percent year-on-year in March, after a
4.6 percent increase in February. Economists had expected a 4.3 percent
rise.

The latest inflation was the lowest in December, when it was 4.0
percent.

The data was collected in the first week of March, which was before the
lockdown came into effect on 27 March.

The main contribution came from food and non-alcoholic beverages,
housing and utilities, transport, and miscellaneous goods and services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 4.2 percent
annually in March. Housing and utilities rose by 4.8 percent and those
of transport and miscellaneous goods and services grew by 3.4 percent
and 6.4 percent, respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in
March. Economists had expected a 0.5 percent increase.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.7 percent in March. Economists had forecast a
4.3 percent rise.

On a monthly basis, the core CPI rose 0.6 percent in March.
