The German [economy][1] is set to see a significant fall in the second
quarter despite easing of coronavirus containment measures, the
Bundesbank said in its monthly report, released Monday.

"Despite the easing measures that have been introduced, social and
economic life in Germany is still far from what was previously
considered normal," the bank said.

Although there are many indications that macroeconomic development will
improve again in the course of the second quarter due to the easing of
containment measures, there is a very high uncertainty about future
economic development, the bank noted.

The largest euro area economy had entered a technical recession in the
first quarter with the GDP contracting 2.2 percent, the biggest since
the global financial crisis in 2008-09.

Bundesbank said the prospects for the labor market for the coming months
are also poor.
