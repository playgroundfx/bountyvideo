The euro area [economy][1] will not return to pre-pandemic level until
2021, European Central Bank Executive Board Philip Lane said in an
interview with El Pa√≠s.

The future depends much on how quickly the restrictions on economic
activity can be eased and also how people adapt to living with the
[coronavirus][2].

"From today's perspective, it looks in any case unlikely that economic
activity will return to its pre-crisis level before 2021, if not later,"
Lane said.

The banker said the ECB is continuously monitoring the situation and are
ready to adjust all instruments if necessary.

The central bank took all steps to make sure that the necessary monetary
and financial conditions for the restoration of economic activity are in
place, in line with the easing of the containment measures, Lane said.

"If we see that financial conditions are too tight, or the pressure on
individual bond [markets][3] is not reflecting economic fundamentals, we
can adjust the size or duration of our purchases, which we can anyway
allocate flexibly over time and market segments," he said.
