The German [economy][1] contracted at the fastest pace since the global
financial crisis in 2008-09 in the first quarter, as the nationwide
lockdown to contain the coronavirus spread weighed on consumption and
overseas demand, pushing the economy into a recession.

Gross domestic product fell 2.2 percent sequentially, which was the
biggest fall since the first quarter of 2009, preliminary data from
Destatis revealed Friday.

This was also the second largest decrease since German unification. The
GDP rate came in line with economists' expectations.

The stagnation in the fourth quarter was revised to reveal a 0.1 percent
contraction.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction indicates that the largest euro
area economy entered a technical recession.

The statistical office forecast 10 percent economic contraction in the
second quarter.

On a yearly basis, GDP declined by [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)-adjusted 2.3 percent in the
first quarter versus a 0.4 percent rise in the fourth quarter. Detailed
GDP data is due on May 25.

Price-adjusted GDP dropped 1.9 percent annually, in contrast to an
expansion of 0.2 percent seen in the fourth quarter. Economists had
forecast a 1.6 percent fall.

Household final consumption expenditure fell sharply and gross fixed
capital formation in machinery and equipment decreased considerably from
previous quarter.

However, final consumption expenditure of general government and gross
fixed capital formation in construction had a stabilizing effect and
prevented a larger GDP decrease.

Meanwhile, both exports and imports logged a strong decline on the
fourth quarter.

Although the economy logged a notable contraction, Germany fared much
better than France and Italy, where GDP declined 5.8 percent and 4.7
percent, respectively, in the first quarter.

Further, data showed that German employment increased by 147,000, or 0.3
percent in the first quarter from the last year. However, such a small
annual increase was last reported in the second quarter of 2010.
