The euro area [economy][1] contracted at the sharpest pace on record in
the first quarter due to the measures taken to contain the spread of
coronavirus, the flash estimate from Eurostat showed Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 3.8 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, in contrast to a 0.1 percent rise in the fourth quarter of
2019.

This was the biggest fall since the series started in 1995 and in line
with the estimate published on April 30.

On a yearly basis, the economy shrank 3.2 percent after rising 1 percent
in the fourth quarter. The rate was revised from -3.3 percent. This was
the biggest decrease since the third quarter of 2009.

While GDP growth will be even bleaker for the second quarter, it is
important to keep [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) data in mind at the moment given that this is a
recession on steroids, Bert Colijn, an ING economist said.

The economist expects a sharp bounce back in the third quarter.

Eurostat said in the final period of the first quarter, member states
widely began [coronavirus][2], or Covid-19, containment measures.

Further, data showed that employment declined for the first time since
2013. Employment was down 0.2 percent in the first quarter from the
previous quarter, when it was up 0.3 percent.

Year-on-year, employment growth eased to 0.3 percent from 1.1 percent in
the fourth quarter. This was the lowest increase since the first quarter
of 2014.

Another report from Eurostat showed that the euro area exports logged
its biggest fall since January 2009, as Covid-19 containment measures
had a significant impact on international trade in goods.

Exports decreased 8.9 percent on month in March. At the same time,
imports fell 9 percent, the biggest drop on record.

Consequently, the trade surplus decreased to a seasonally adjusted EUR
23.5 billion in March from EUR 25.6 billion in February.

On an unadjusted basis, exports fell 6.2 percent year-on-year and
imports decreased 10.1 percent in March.

Due to a sharp fall in imports, the trade surplus increased to EUR 28.2
billion from EUR 22.7 billion in the same period last year.
