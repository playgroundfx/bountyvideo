Retail sales in the U.S. plunged by even more than expected in the month
of April, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Friday.

The report said retail sales cratered by 16.4 percent in April after
tumbling by a revised 8.3 percent in March. Economists had expected
retail sales to plummet by 12.0 percent compared to the 8.7 percent
slump originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail sales plunged
by an even steeper 17.2 percent in April after falling by a revised 4.0
percent in March.

Ex-auto sales were expected to tumble by 8.6 percent compared to the 4.5
percent nosedive originally reported for the previous month.
