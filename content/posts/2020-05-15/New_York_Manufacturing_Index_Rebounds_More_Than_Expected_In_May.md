A report released by the New York Federal Reserve on Friday showed
regional manufacturing activity continued to deteriorate significantly
in the month of May, although the pace of contraction slowed
considerably from the previous month.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index jumped
nearly thirty points to a negative 48.5 in May from a negative 78.2 in
April.

While a negative reading indicates a continued contraction in regional
manufacturing activity, the index came in well above economist estimates
for a reading of negative 63.5.
