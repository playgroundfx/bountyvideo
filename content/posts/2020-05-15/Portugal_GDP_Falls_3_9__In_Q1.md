Portugal's [economy][1] contracted drastically in the first quarter as
both domestic demand and exports weakened due to the disruption caused
by the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic from March, flash estimates
from Statistics Portugal showed on Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product decreased 3.9 percent from the fourth quarter,
when the economy expanded 0.7 percent.  
  
Domestic demand dropped 1.9 percent, exports fell 7.3 percent and
imports decreased 2.9 percent.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, GDP decreased 2.4 percent in the first quarter
after a 2.2 percent increase in the previous three months.  
  
Net exports made a negative contribution of 1.4 percent. Domestic demand
also contributed negatively, -1 percent, for the first time since the
third quarter of 2013 amid decreases in private consumption and
investment.

In a bid to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, Portugal closed schools and
universities on March 16 and declared a state of emergency on March 18
that led to the temporary closure of several economic activities and the
restriction on the free movement of persons, the statistical office
said.
