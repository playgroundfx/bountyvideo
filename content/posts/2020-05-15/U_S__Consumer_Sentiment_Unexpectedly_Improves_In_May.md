With stimulus checks improving consumers' finances and widespread price
discounting boosting buying attitudes, the University of Michigan
released a report on Friday showing an unexpected improvement in U.S.
consumer sentiment in the month of May.

The report said the consumer sentiment index rose to 73.7 in May after
plummeting to 71.8 in April. The rebound surprised economists, who had
expected the index to slip to 68.0.

The unexpected increase by the headline index came as the current
economic conditions index jumped to 83.0 in May from 74.3 in April.

On the other hand, the report said the index of consumer expectations
fell to 67.7 in May from 70.1 in the previous month.

"Personal financial prospects for the year ahead continued to weaken,
falling to the lowest level in almost six years, with declines
especially sharp among upper income households," said Surveys of
Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin

He added, "Improved views on buying conditions were due to discounted
prices and low interest rates, although their impact was partially
offset by uncertainties about job and income prospects."

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations surged up to 3.0
percent in May from 2.1 percent in April, while five-year inflation
expectations inched up to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent.

Curtin called the jump in one-year inflation expectations "perhaps the
most surprising finding" in the survey, noting there were "wide
differences across age and income subgroups."
