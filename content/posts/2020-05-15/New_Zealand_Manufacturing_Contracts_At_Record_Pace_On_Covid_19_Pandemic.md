New Zealand manufacturing sector contracted at a record pace in April
due to [coronavirus][1] lockdown, survey data from the BusinessNZ showed
Friday.

The Performance of Manufacturing Index fell to 26.1 in April from 38.0
in March.

This was the lowest reading since the survey began. Any score below 50
indicates contraction in the sector.

As part of March and almost all of April was in complete lockdown for
the country, a significant fall in manufacturing activity was fully
expected, BusinessNZ's Executive Director Catherine Beard, said.

The sub-indices of production declined 19.8 in April and new orders fell
to 17.8.

"Looking at comments from respondents, only two words stand out, namely
COVID-19 and lockdown, with 89.7 percent of respondents outlining
negative comments," Beard said.

"Recent negative PMI readings from around the world illustrate the
widespread economic pain being felt," BNZ Senior Economist, Doug Steel
said.

"New Zealand's April reading is lower than other countries we often
compare ourselves to, which tallies with suggestions that NZ
restrictions have been tighter than many," Steel added.
