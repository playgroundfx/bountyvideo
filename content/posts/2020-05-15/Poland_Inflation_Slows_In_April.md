Poland's consumer price inflation eased in April, as estimated
initially, final data from Statistics Poland showed on Friday.

The consumer price index climbed 3.4 percent year-on-year in April,
after a 4.6 percent increase in March. This was in line with economists'
expectation. The initial estimate released on April 30.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages grew 7.4 percent annually in
April. Prices for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, and
restaurants and hotels increased by 7.5 percent and 6.3 percent,
respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices decreased 0.1 percent in
April, reversing a 0.1 percent rise in the preceding month. The initial
estimate had shown no change from the previous month.
