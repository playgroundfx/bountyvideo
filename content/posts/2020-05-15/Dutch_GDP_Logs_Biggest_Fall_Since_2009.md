The Dutch [economy][1] contracted at the fastest pace since 2009 mainly
due to a record fall in household consumption amid coronavirus, or
Covid-19, pandemic, data from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed
Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 1.7 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, this was the biggest decline since the first quarter of 2009,
when it was down 3.6 percent.

Nonetheless, the 1.7 percent fall in the first quarter was much smaller
than the economists' forecast of -3 percent. In the fourth quarter of
2019, GDP was up 0.4 percent.

The fall in GDP suggested that the economic impact of the
[coronavirus][2] was mild, at least in international comparison, Marcel
Klok, an ING economist said.

"The "intelligent lockdown" as it has been dubbed by PM Rutte has paid
off economically thus far, although the second quarter is likely to be
much worse," Klok added.

The expenditure-side showed that household consumption fell 2.7 percent,
marking the largest decrease since the series began in 1987. Government
spending dropped 1.4 percent.

Investment slid 1.1 percent. At the same time, exports and imports fell
3 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively.

The statistical office said the global outbreak of coronavirus and
related measures to contain its spread have caused an unprecedented
decline in economic activity.

On a yearly basis, GDP was down 0.5 percent versus a 1.6 percent rise in
the fourth quarter of 2019. This was the first contraction since the
second quarter of 2013.
