Switzerland's economic outlook remained very positive in May, driven by
manufacturing and exports, survey data by the KOF economic institute
showed Friday.

The KOF Economic Barometer climbed to a new record high of 143.2 point
from 136.4 in April, which was revised from 134.0. Economists had
forecast a score of 136.

The reading is well above its long-term average.

"The outlook for the Swiss [economy][1] for the middle of 2021 can be
regarded as very positive, provided that the containment of the virus
continues to progress," the think tank said.

Positive inputs also came from indicators for accommodation and food
service activities followed by those for the other services sector.
Meanwhile, private consumption measures gave slight negative impulses.
