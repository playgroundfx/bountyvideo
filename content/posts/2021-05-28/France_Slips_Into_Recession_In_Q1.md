France's [economy][1] contracted in the first quarter, instead of
expansion estimated initially, and moved back into recession, revised
data from the statistical office Insee showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 0.1 percent sequentially, following a 1.5
percent drop in the fourth quarter. The sequential decline was revised
down from the 0.4 percent growth estimated initially.

GDP was 4.7 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2019, which
was the last quarter before the Covid-19 crisis.

Household consumption grew 0.1 percent after a 5.6 percent drop a
quarter ago. Gross fixed capital formation increased slightly by 0.2
percent. Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventories
contributed +0.1 points to GDP growth this quarter.

Imports advanced 1.1 percent, while exports fell slightly by 0.2 percent
in the first quarter. Conversely, changes in inventories made a positive
contribution to GDP growth of +0.2 points.

In the full year of 2020, GDP had contracted 8 percent from the same
period of last year.

The general government deficit fell to 9.4 percent of GDP after 10.9
percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Another report from the statistical office showed that consumer spending
declined unexpectedly in April as the third lockdown dampened demand for
manufactured goods.

Household spending was down 8.3 percent month-on-month in April, much
bigger than the 0.3 percent decrease seen in March. Economists had
forecast an increase of 0.4 percent.

Manufactured goods purchases decreased 18.9 percent on month in April,
and energy spending dropped 0.6 percent.
