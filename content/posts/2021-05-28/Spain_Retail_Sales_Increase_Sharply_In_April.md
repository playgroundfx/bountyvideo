Spain retail sales logged a sharp double-digit growth in April driven by
non-food sales, data published by the statistical office INE showed on
Friday.

Retail sales surged 41 percent year-on-year, following a 14.3 percent
rise in March.  
  
On an unadjusted basis, retail sales growth advanced to 38.5 percent
from 18.1 percent in the previous month.

Food sales rose only 0.3 percent, while non-food product sales grew
sharply by 107.2 in April.

Month-on-month, retail sales dropped 0.4 percent, in contrast to the 2.7
percent increase seen in March. This was the first drop in three months.
