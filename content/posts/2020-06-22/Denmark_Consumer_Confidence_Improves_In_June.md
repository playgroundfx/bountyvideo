Denmark's consumer confidence improved sharply in June, mainly due to
the improvement in households' assessment of the general economic
situation and an increased desire to buy, survey data from Statistics
Denmark showed on Monday.

The consumer confidence index increased to -3.1 in June from -8.8 in
May.

The index measuring consumers' view regarding the future personal
financial situation increased to 12.6 in June from 9.6 in the preceding
month.

The measure reflecting the past personal financial situation rose to 7.5
in June from 3.3 in the prior month.

Households' assessment regarding the general economic situation of the
country over the next year increased to 2.3 in June from -9.2 in May.

The index reflecting the view on the past general economic situation
increased to -33.4 from -36.2 in May. Consumers were less negative
toward the big purchases in June as the index rose to -4.4 from -11.6 in
the previous month.
