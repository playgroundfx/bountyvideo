Estonia's producer prices continued to fall in May, data from Statistics
Estonia showed on Monday.

The producer price index declined 3.9 percent year-on-year in May,
following a 4.4 percent fall in April.

Prices of manufacturing fell 2.7 percent annually in May. Prices for
electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply, and water supply
declined 24.4 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively.

Meanwhile, prices for mining and quarrying industry grew 4.6 percent.

The index was mainly affected by price decrease in electricity supply
and fuel oils, Eveli Sokman, leading analyst at Statistics Estonia said.

"While in April, price decrease in the production of dairy products had
a significant impact, in May, significant impact came from price
increase in the same economic activity," Sokman said.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices rose 0.1 percent in May,
after a 0.3 percent fall in the preceding month.
