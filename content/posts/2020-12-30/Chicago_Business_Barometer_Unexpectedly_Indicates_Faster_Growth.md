A report released by MNI Indicators on Wednesday showed an unexpected
acceleration in the pace of growth in Chicago-area [business][1]
activity in the month of December.

MNI Indicators said its Chicago business barometer rose to 59.5 in
December from 58.2 in November, with a reading above 50 indicating
growth. Economists had expected the barometer to dip to 57.0.

The unexpected uptick by the headline index was partly due to a notable
increase by the employment index, which reached a one-year high but
continued to indicate a contraction.

The production index also inched up by 1.1 points as business activity
picked up, while easing demand led to a 2-point drop by the new orders
index.

On the inflation front, the prices paid index climbed 2.2 points to its
highest level since September of 2018, with firms reporting higher
prices for metals.

When asked about their planned business activity forecast for 2021, 44.9
percent of respondents said they see growth below 5 percent, while 42.9
percent expect growth to be between 5 and 10 percent.

A majority of respondents said they do not yet know if they will adjust
their 2021 budget as [coronavirus][2] vaccines roll out over the next
few months.
