At the same time, the number of employed persons declined by around
48,800 persons to 3.72 million during the January to March period.

"The labor market showed further sharp deterioration as the COVID-19
pandemic severely disrupted a wide range of economic activities," the
Secretary for Labor and Welfare Law Chi-kwong said.

"The labor market will continue to face significant pressure from the
economic fallout arising from the pandemic in the near term," Chi-kwong
added.
