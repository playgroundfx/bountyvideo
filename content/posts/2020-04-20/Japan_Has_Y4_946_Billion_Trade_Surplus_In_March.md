Japan posted a merchandise trade surplus of 4.946 billion yen in March,
the Ministry of Finance said on Monday.

That was well shy of forecasts for 459.9 billion yen and down sharply
from the 1,109.8 billion yen surplus in February.

Exports tumbled 11.7 percent on year to 6.357 trillion yen - missing
estimates for a fall of 9.4 percent following the 1.0 percent drop in
the previous month.

Imports sank an annual 5.0 percent to 6.352 trillion yen versus
expectations for a decline of 8.7 percent following the 14.0 percent
slide a month earlier.
