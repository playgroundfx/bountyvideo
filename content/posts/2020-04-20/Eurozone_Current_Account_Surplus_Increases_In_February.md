The euro area current account surplus increased in February, driven by a

Monday.

The current account surplus rose to EUR 40 billion from EUR 32 billion
in January. In the same period last year, the surplus totaled EUR 28
billion.

The surplus on trade in goods increased to EUR 33 billion from EUR 30

EUR 8 billion a month ago.

Primary income remained unchanged at EUR 10 billion, while the shortfall
on secondary income narrowed sharply to EUR 8 billion from EUR 16
billion.

In the 12-month period to February, the current account logged a surplus
of EUR 339 billion or 2.8 percent of euro area GDP, compared with a
surplus of EUR 361 billion or 3.1 percent of GDP in the same period last
year.
