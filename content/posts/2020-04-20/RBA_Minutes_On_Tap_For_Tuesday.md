The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its April 7 monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, highlighting a modest day for Asia-
Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the board kept its benchmark interest rate steady at the
record low of 0.25 percent and the targeted yield on three-year
government bonds at around 0.25 percent.

The bank had announced asset purchase program and a three-year funding
facility to help small and medium sized firms, at the emergency meeting
held in March.

New Zealand will see March results for non-resident bond holdings; in
February, they surged 52.1 percent.
