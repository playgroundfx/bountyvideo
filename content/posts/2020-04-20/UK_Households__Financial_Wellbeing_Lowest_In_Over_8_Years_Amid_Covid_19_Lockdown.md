British households' financial well-being in April was the lowest since
late 2011 as job security perceptions sunk to a record low amid the
lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, pandemic.  
  
The UK Household Finance Index, which measures households' overall
perceptions of financial well-being, dropped to 34.9 in April, it's
lowest since November 2011, from 42.5 in March, results of a survey by
IHS Markit showed on Monday. A reading below 50 suggests a decline or
deterioration.  
  
This signaled the largest month-to-month drop in the index since the
survey's inception in 2009, IHS Markit said.  
  
The monthly survey is compiled by IHS Markit based on monthly responses
from approximately 1,500 individuals in Great Britain aged 18-64. The
data is collected by Ipsos MORI and the online data collection for the
latest survey took place between April 2 and 5.  
  
"The UK Household Finance Index is already showing wide-reaching
financial consequences of the lockdown measures implemented in late
March," IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.  
  
"The latest data were compiled during the first week of April and
therefore give an early indication of the severe impact on household
finances from the public [health][2] emergency."

The workplace activity sub-index dropped by over 16 points. The
strongest declines were logged among those employed in media, culture or
[entertainment][3] sectors.  
  
Britons reported a fall in earnings from employment for the first time
since October 2017. The speed of decline significantly outpaced all
previous reductions seen since the survey began in early 2009, IHS
Markit said.

The pessimism surrounding job security was the greatest ever in the
survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) despite stimulus support from the government for
businesses and employees.

Concerns were the least among those working in education, health or
social care sectors, while worries were the greatest among those in
media, culture or entertainment sectors.  
  
Meanwhile, there was no reason for alarm on household balance sheets in
April, despite the marked deterioration in earnings and overall
financial conditions, the survey found.

Debt levels remained broadly stable versus March, and unsecured lending
requirements rose at a rate that was below its long-run average as
households tapped savings.

"Limiting the adverse impact on UK household balance sheets will be
crucial in the coming months so that when economic activity does
recover, consumers are not stuck repaying debts and instead are able to
boost discretionary spending to aid a strong recovery," Hayes said.  
  
UK households hardly changed their expectations after the Bank of
England cut the base to a record low 0.10 percent, the survey showed.

The majority continue to anticipate that the central bank's next move
will be a hike. Over 63 percent expects the increase to come in the next
24 months, while the share of those expecting further rate cut climbed
to 26.4 percent from 24 percent.
