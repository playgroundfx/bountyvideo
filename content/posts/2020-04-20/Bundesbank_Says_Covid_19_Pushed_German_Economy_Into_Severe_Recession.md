The [coronavirus][1] outbreak and the subsequent containment measures
have plunged the German [economy][2] into a severe recession and an
immediate recovery is unlikely, the Bundesbank said in its monthly
report released on Monday.

"How big the decline in overall economic activity will ultimately be is
currently difficult to predict," the central bank said.  
  
"Ultimately, the severity of the recession would largely depend on when
and to what extent the restrictions introduced to combat the pandemic
could be further relaxed," the Bundesbank said.

The lockdown caused activity in some consumer-related service sectors
such as catering, travel, leisure and culture, textile sales, passenger
transport, to stop from mid-March.  
  
This could have led to an over 1 percent decline in the GDP in the first
quarter, the Bundesbank said.  
  
The strain on the economy also reflected in the labor market and the
number of advertisement for temporary work exploded in March, the report
noted.  
  
Bundesbank's experts reckoned that the number of short-time workers
likely grew to over a million in April.  
  
The slump caused by the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic is much worse
than the global financial crisis of 2008-09 as more sectors are
involved. The number of employees who are potentially entitled to social
security contributions would be six million higher now, the bank said.  
  
Germany, which has the biggest economy in the euro area, has extended
its lockdown until May 3, but has announced some cautious easing in some
sectors.  
  
As substantial restrictions are likely to remain until a medical
solution is found for the Covid-19 disease. Hence, the Bundesbank said a
rapid and strong economic recovery currently seems unlikely.

"It also plays a role in how quickly consumers and companies normalize
their behaviour after the easing," the bank added. The recovery will
also depend on the situation in the main trading partners of Germany.

That said, experts do not expect a self-reinforcing downward spiral for
the German economy, the report said, thanks to the robust social
security system and monetary and fiscal stimulus measures.  
  
Bundesbank expects the inflation rate to decline sharply in coming
months as the low crude oil prices will gradually be passed on to
consumers.
