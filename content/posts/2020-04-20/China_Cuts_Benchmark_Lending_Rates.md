China's central bank on Monday reduced its benchmark lending rates, as
widely expected, as the [economy][1] contracted for the first time at
least since 1992 amid coronavirus outbreak.

The one-year loan prime rate was lowered by 20 basis points to 3.85
percent and the five-year loan prime rate was cut by 10 basis points to
4.65 percent.

The loan prime rate is fixed monthly based on the submission of 18
banks, though Beijing has influence over the rate-setting. This new
lending rate replaced the central bank's traditional benchmark lending
rate in August 2019.

The People's Bank of China last week reduced its one-year medium-term
lending facility, or MLF, rate to 2.95 percent from 3.15 percent and
injected CNY 100 billion through the MLF operation.

In March, the PBoC had reduced the reserve requirement ratio for
qualified banks and the reverse repo rate.

September should mark the point when the PBoC hits the "ultra-low"
interest rate level, Iris Pang, an ING economist said.

After that, the PBoC may need to rely more on reserve requirement ratio
cuts than rate cuts. The PBoC may use RRR cuts more than rate cuts
before September to delay its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates touching ultra-low levels,
the economist noted.

The economy shrank 6.8 percent on a yearly basis in the first quarter,
which was the first decline since the nation began reporting quarterly
data in 1992. The economy had expanded 6 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2019.
