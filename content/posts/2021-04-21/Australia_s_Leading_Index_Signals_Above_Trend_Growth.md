Australia's leading index rose in March and continued to suggest above
trend growth in 2021, Westpac said Wednesday.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Index, which indicates the
likely pace of economic activity relative to trend three to nine months
into the future, climbed to 3.29 percent in March from 3 percent in
February.

Westpac forecast economic growth of 4.5 percent for 2021. The agency
said the reopening of the [economy][1], cashed up households, and an
eleven-year high in consumer sentiment all point to strong spending.

Over the last six months, the index growth rate lifted to 3.29 percent
in March from -0.24 percent in September.

The main components driving the 3.53 percentage point turnaround have
been total hours worked, commodity prices, measured in AUD [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), US
industrial production and dwelling approvals, all of which have switched
from being negative drags on growth to strong supports.

These improvements have been partially offset by reduced support from
smaller contributions from the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer
Expectations Index and the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Unemployment
Expectations Index.
