The services sector in New Zealand moved into expansion territory in
September, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Monday with a
Performance of Services Index score of 50.3.

That's up from the upwardly revised 47.2 (originally 46.9) and it moves
above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from
contraction.

Individually, sales (52.4) and new orders (54.9) expanded last month,
while employment (48.7), supplier deliveries (43.0) and stocks (44.8)
remained in contraction.

"Recent PSI and PMI readings are consistent with a big bounce back in Q3
GDP from the massive decline in Q2. The exact degree of it is much more
difficult to judge. What lies ahead is arguably more important - making
the PSI and PMI indicators important to monitor over coming months,"
said BNZ Senior Economist Doug Steel.
