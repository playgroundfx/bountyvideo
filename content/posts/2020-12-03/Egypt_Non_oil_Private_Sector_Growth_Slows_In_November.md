Egypt's non-oil private sector expanded in November, albeit at a softer
pace, data from the IHS Markit revealed on Thursday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 50.9 in November from
51.4 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Business activity grew for the fifth month in a row in November, albeit
at a softer pace. New [business][1] growth eased and firms continued to
register an increase in sales.

Export volume increased in November and total sales growth eased. The
slowdown was due to the stricter lockdowns to combat a second wave of
Covid-19 cases.

Confidence regarding the business activity in the next 12-months fell to
its weakest in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Employment was reduced for the thirteenth month in a row in November,
despite rising orders and increasing backlogs of works. The rate of
decline in employment, however, was the slowest in this sequence.

Inputs rose for the second month in a row in November and stock building
accelerated to the fastest since September last year.

Input prices rose in November and the overall input price inflation
softened, which led to a modest increase in average selling charges.

Suppliers' delivery time shortened in November at the fastest since the
survey began in April 2011.

"However, Egyptian firms were also the least optimistic about future
output in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), amid concerns that activity could weaken
if COVID-19 cases rise again domestically," David Owen, an economist at
IHS Markit, said.
