The private sector in Singapore continued to contract in November, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Thursday with a services PMI score of 46.7.

That's down from 48.6 in October, and it moved further beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output fell back into contraction and there was a sharper
fall in demand, while [business][1] confidence also slipped.

Employment was reduced further and at the fastest rate for three months
as operating capacity remained in surplus.
