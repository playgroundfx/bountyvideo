Eurozone retail sales recovered at a faster than expected pace in
October, data released by Eurostat showed on Thursday.

Retail sales increased 1.5 percent month-on-month, reversing a 1.7
percent fall in September. Economists had forecast a moderate growth of
0.8 percent.

On a yearly basis, retail sales growth accelerated to 4.3 percent from
2.5 percent in the previous month. This was also faster than the
economists' forecast of 2.7 percent.

Data showed that sale of food, drinks and tobacco and non-food products
gained 2 percent each in October. Meanwhile, sale of automotive fuel in
specialized stores were down 3.7 percent.

If unemployment does not rise rapidly over the months of new
limitations, it could well be that retail is once again well positioned
to recover quickly, Bert Colijn, an ING economist said.

Before vaccinations are widespread, consumption of goods is likely to
remain easier than some services, which favors the retail recovery, the
economist added.
