China's service sector expanded strongly in November amid greater
customer demand and a sustained recovery in market conditions after the
[coronavirus][1] disease outbreak, survey data from IHS Markit showed
Thursday.  
  
The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 57.8 in November from
56.8 in the previous month. The rate of growth was the second fastest
since April 2010, exceeded only by that recorded in June 2020.

New orders climbed the most since April 2010 as export sales grew for
the first time since June. Efforts to expand capacity and rising order
volumes led companies to increase their staffing levels for the fourth
month in a row.

Input costs increased at the fastest pace since August 2010 due to
higher raw material and staffing costs.

Firmer demand conditions enabled firms to partially pass on their
increased cost burdens to clients in the form of higher output prices.
The rate of charge inflation was the steepest for just over ten-
and-a-half years.

Business confidence regarding the year ahead strengthened for the third
consecutive month in November. The overall degree of positive sentiment
was the highest since April 2011.

The Caixin composite output index came in at 57.5 in November, stronger
than 55.7 the previous month. The reading signaled the steepest growth
in private sector since March 2010.

The higher index reading was supported by the steepest increase in
manufacturing output for a decade and services sector growth.

"We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue
for several months," Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight
Group said. At the same time, deciding [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) gradually withdraw the
easing policies launched during the epidemic will require careful
planning as uncertainties still exist inside and outside China.
