Australia had a merchandise trade surplus of A$7.456 billion in October,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

That beat expectations for a surplus of A$5.8 billion and was up from
the upwardly revised A$5.815 billion surplus in September (originally
A$5.630 billion).

Imports were up 1.0 percent on month following the downwardly revised
6.5 percent slide in September (originally -6.0 percent). Exports
climbed 5.0 percent on month, up from the downwardly revised 2.6 percent
gain in the previous month (originally up 4.0 percent).
