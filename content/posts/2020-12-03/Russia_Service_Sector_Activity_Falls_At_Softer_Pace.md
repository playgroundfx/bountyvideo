Russia's service sector contracted for the second straight month in
November, but at a softer pace, survey data from IHS Markit showed on
Thursday

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.2 in November from
46.9 in October. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the
sector.

Output declined for the second month in a row in November. New
[business][1] fell further and new orders decreased.

On the price front, the cost burden increased since January last year
and input prices rose. Selling prices increased in November, with the
rate of inflation remaining solid.

The number of workforce were reduced for the third month in a row in
November, with the pace of job shedding easing slightly from October.
Backlogs of work declined.

Business confidence for the next 12 months outlook improved in November
and optimism was reported.

The composite output index increased to 47.8 in November from 47.1 in
the previous month.

"Nonetheless, our forecast expects that the annual rate of inflation
will average 3.3 percent in 2020, with price rises weighed down by
subdued demand," Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
