Sweden's services sector activity expanded for the fourth month in a row
in November, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association
SILF showed on Thursday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector increased to 58.6
in November from revised 55.3 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

"All sub-indices rose in November, which stands out compared with the
eurozone, where PMI figures declined," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar
said.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened to the highest since April. Business
volume, employment and order intake increased in November.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, reached
the highest level in two years, rising to 58.7 in November from 56.2 in
the previous month.
