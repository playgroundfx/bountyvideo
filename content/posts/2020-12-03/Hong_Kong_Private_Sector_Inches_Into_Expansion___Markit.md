The private sector in Hong Kong moved barely into expansion territory in
November, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Thursday
with a services PMI score of 50.1.

That's up from 49.8 in October, and it moves above the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new [business][1] fell at a slower rate, while input
inventories rose for the first time in almost two years. But business
sentiment remained negative.

Employment shrank for a second straight month in November, but the pace
of decrease was only marginal.
