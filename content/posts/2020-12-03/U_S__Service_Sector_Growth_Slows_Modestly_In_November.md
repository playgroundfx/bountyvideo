A slight pullback in the rate of growth in U.S. service sector activity
continued in the month of November, according to a report released by
the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday.

The ISM said its services PMI edged down to 55.9 in November after
dipping to 56.6 in October, although a reading above 50 still indicates
growth. Economists had expected the index to slip to 56.0.

"Respondents' comments are mixed about [business][1] conditions and the
economy," said Anthony Nieves, Chair of the ISM Services Business Survey
Committee.

He added, "Most companies are cautious as they navigate operations amid
the pandemic and the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election."

The modest decrease by the headline index came as the business activity
index slid to 58.0 in November from 61.2 in October. The new orders
index also fell to 57.2 from 58.8.

On the other hand, the ISM said the employment index rose to 51.5 in
November from 50.1 in October, indicating the third consecutive month of
job growth in the service sector.

The report said the prices index also climbed to 66.1 in November in
63.9 in October, suggesting a faster rate of price growth compared to
the previous month.

"Looking ahead, we expect the services recovery to continue cooling in
the months to come," Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

He added, "While the recent string of positive vaccine [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is
encouraging, services, particularly consumer-facing firms, will not be
on a stable footing until broad swathes of the population are immunized
and the [health][2] crisis is fully over."

The ISM released a separate report on Tuesday showing the pace of growth
in U.S. manufacturing activity slowed by more than expected in the month
of November.

The manufacturing PMI dropped to 57.5 in November from 59.3 in October,
while economists had expected the index to dip to 58.0.
