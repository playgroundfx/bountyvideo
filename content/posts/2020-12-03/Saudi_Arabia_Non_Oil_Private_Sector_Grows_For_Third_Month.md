Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector expanded for the third straight
month in November amid a rise in sales, survey results from IHS Markit
showed on Thursday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.7 in November from 51.0 in
October. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in the sector. This was
the strongest increase in [business][1] conditions since January, the
survey said.

Output rose at the fastest rate in ten months in November and new work
increased. New export orders increased with rise in both domestic and
foreign sales.

Business confidence for the next 12-months rose to the highest seen in
ten months.

Purchasing activity increased sharply in November. Employment rose for
the first time since January, despite a further modest decline in
outstanding work.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in November.

The rate of input price inflation was the sharpest seen in five years
and output charges increased. The overall rate of inflation was the
second-fastest since October 2014.

"However, most of the key series remain off their trend hinting at a
continued gap between the [economy][2]'s current conditions and its pre-
COVID momentum," David Owen, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
