Germany's construction sector contracted at a slower pace in December,
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.2 in December
from 47.9 in the previous month. A score below 50.0 indicates
contraction in the sector.

Among three broad categories monitored by the survey, civil engineering
activity remained the weakest-performing segment. The decline in
commercial activity also moderated, while work on residential projects
fell at a marginal rate that was little-changed since November.

New work decreased at a moderate pace in December. Employment rose for
the fourth consecutive month.

On the cost front, input price inflation remained elevated by [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
standards but dipped to a nine-month low amid fewer reports of supply
delays.

Concerns about rising prices, lingering supply-chain issues, and a lack
of tender opportunities continued to dampen [business][1] confidence in
December.
