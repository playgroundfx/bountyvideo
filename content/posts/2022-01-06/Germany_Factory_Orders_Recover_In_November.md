Germany's factory orders rebounded at a faster-than-expected pace in
November underpinned by robust foreign demand, data from Destatis showed
on Thursday.

New orders grew 3.7 percent month-on-month in November, reversing a
strong decline of 5.8 percent in October. The pace of growth also
exceeded the economists' forecast of 2.1 percent.

Excluding major orders, new orders advanced 3.8 percent from the
previous month.

Compared with February 2020, the month before restrictions were imposed
due to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic in Germany, new orders were 6.6
percent higher in November.

The strong growth in new orders was attributable to foreign orders which
grew 8.0 percent. At the same time, domestic orders went down 2.5
percent.

The largest increase in new orders of 32.0 percent was recorded in the
manufacture of other transport equipment for which extensive major
orders were reported.

Producers of intermediate goods saw new orders in November rose 1.2
percent on the month before. At the same time, manufacturers of capital
goods recorded an increase of 5.3 percent. Regarding consumer goods,
orders went up 3.8 percent.

On a yearly basis, factory orders gained 1.3 percent, faster than the
0.1 percent increase seen in October.

Further, data showed that manufacturing turnover gained 4.1 percent on
month, following a 3.4 percent rise in October. Compared with November
2020, turnover was by 0.3 percent higher.

Although demand for industrial products is weakening, there is still
significant upside potential for production, Christoph Weil, an
economist at Commerzbank, said. This is because companies are still
sitting on a huge pile of orders.
