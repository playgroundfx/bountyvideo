With the more closely watched monthly jobs report looming, the Labor
Department released a report on Thursday unexpectedly showing a modest
increase in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended January 1st.

The report showed initial jobless claims crept up to 207,000, an
increase of 7,000 from the previous week's revised level of 200,000.

The uptick came as a surprise to economists, who had expected jobless
claims to edge down to 197,000 from the 198,000 originally reported for
the previous week.

"The Omicron surge in [coronavirus][1] cases may have helped to prop up
claims, but it's difficult to say conclusively since the claims data are
still subject to seasonal noise," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead
Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Assuming any layoffs related to Omicron are limited amid
tight labor market conditions, we expect initial claims to continue to
hover around the 200k mark."

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also inched up to 204,500, an increase of 4,750 from the previous week's
revised average of 199,750.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also rose by 36,000 to 1.754 million in the
week ended December 25th. In the previous week, continuing claims hit
their lowest level since March of 2020.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims still fell to a new
pandemic-era low of 1,798,750, a decrease of 61,250 from the previous
week's revised average of 1,860,000.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched report on employment in the month of December.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 400,000 jobs in
December after rising by 210,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate
is expected to edge down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent.
