Corrected fourth para

Germany's factory orders rebounded in November largely driven by foreign
demand, data from Destatis showed on Thursday.

New orders grew 3.7 percent month-on-month in November, reversing a
strong decline of 5.8 percent in October. The pace of growth also
exceeded the economists' forecast of 2.1 percent.

Excluding major orders, new orders advanced 3.8 percent from the
previous month.

The strong growth in new orders was attributable to foreign orders which
increased by 8.0 percent. At the same time, domestic orders went down
2.5 percent.

Data showed that manufacturing turnover gained 4.1 percent on month,
following a 3.4 percent rise in October. Compared with November 2020,
turnover was by 0.3 percent higher.
