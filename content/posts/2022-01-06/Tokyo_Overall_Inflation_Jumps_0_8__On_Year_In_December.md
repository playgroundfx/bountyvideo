Overall consumer prices for the Tokyo region of Japan were up 0.8
percent on year in December, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communication said on Friday.

That was in line with expectations and up from the 0.5 percent gain in
November.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, climbed an annual 0.5
percent - again matching forecasts and up from 0.3 percent in the
previous month.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, both overall inflation and core
CPI were up 0.1 percent.
