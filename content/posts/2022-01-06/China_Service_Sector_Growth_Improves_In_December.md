China's services activity growth improved at the end of the year with
firms posting faster increase in new work, survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Thursday.

The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.1 in December
from 52.1 in November.

A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector. Output increased
in each of the past four months.

Total intakes of new [business][1] increased for the fourth successive
month in December. Moreover, the pace of growth quickened from
November's three-month low. Services companies also registered a further
increase in new orders from abroad.

Chinese service sector employment improved for the fourth month running
underpinned by improved demand conditions and efforts to lift
operational capacity.

Although staff numbers increased, backlogs of work expanded for the
fifth time in the past six months in December.

On the price front, the survey showed that average input costs increased
in the final month of 2021. Nonetheless, the rate of inflation softened
since November.

At the same time, charges set by services companies rose only
moderately, with the rate of inflation edging down to a four-month low.

Although Chinese service providers remained highly upbeat regarding the
12-month outlook for business activity, overall sentiment softened since
November.

At 53.0 in December, the composite output index rose from a three-month
low of 51.2 in November. Output has now risen in each of the past four
months, with the latest increase the quickest since July.
