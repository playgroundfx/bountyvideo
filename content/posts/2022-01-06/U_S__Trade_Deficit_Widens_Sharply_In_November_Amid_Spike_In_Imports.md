The U.S. trade deficit widened significantly in the month of November,
according to a report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.

The report said the trade deficit widened to $80.2 billion in November
from a revised $67.2 billion in October. Economists had expected the
deficit to widen to $77.1 billion from the $67.1 billion originally
reported for the previous month.

"The sharp rebound in the trade deficit in November means that net trade
is now on track to be a small drag on fourth quarter GDP growth, rather
than a small boost as we had previously assumed," said Michael Pearce,
Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "Partly as a result, we now expect GDP growth was a slightly
less impressive 4.5% annualized in the fourth quarter, down from our
previous estimate of 6.5%."

The wider than expected trade deficit came as the value of imports
spiked by 4.6 percent to $304.4 billion in November after jumping by 1
percent to $291.0 billion in October.

Imports of industrial supplies and materials, such as crude oil, showed
a substantial increase along with imports of consumer goods.

Meanwhile, the report showed the value of exports crept up by 0.2
percent to $244.2 billion in November after soaring by 8.3 percent to
$223.9 billion in October.

A sharp increase in exports of services helped offset decreases in
exports of capital goods and industrial supplies and materials.

The Commerce Department noted the goods deficit widened to $99.0 billion
in November from $83.6 billion in October, while the services surplus
increased to $18.8 billion from $16.7 billion.

"Looking ahead, we expect the trade deficit to remain [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly
elevated until pandemic worries ease," said Kathy Bostjancic, Chief U.S.
Financial Economist at Oxford Economics. "The Omicron variant is a key
downside risk that threatens to distort trade flows by slowing the
global recovery in early 2022."
