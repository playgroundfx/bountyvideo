The average of household spending in Japan was down 1.2 percent on month
in November, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication said on
Friday - coming in at 277,029 yen.

That was well shy of expectations for an increase of 1.2 percent
following the 3.4 percent gain in October.

On a yearly basis, household spending sank 1.3 percent - again missing
forecasts for an increase of 1.6 percent after dipping 0.6 percent in
the previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 481,838 yen, up 1.1
percent on year.
