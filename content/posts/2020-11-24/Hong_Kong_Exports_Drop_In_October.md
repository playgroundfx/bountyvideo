Hong Kong's merchandise exports dropped in October after rising in the
previous month, data from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Tuesday.

Exports fell 1.1 percent year-on-year in October, after a 9.1 percent
decrease in September.

Imports rose 0.6 percent annually in October, after a 3.4 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit widened to HK$36.756 billion in October from HK$30.590
billion in the same month last year. In September, the deficit was
HK$12.694 billion.

For the January to October period, exports decreased 2.9 percent year-
on-year and imports fell 5.6 percent. The trade deficit was HK$329.975
billion.

The value of merchandise exports decreased slightly in October from a
year ago, as exports to the Mainland and the US switched to mild
declines, the government spokesman said.

"Looking ahead, while the Mainland [economy][1] is expected to post
further strong growth, the deterioration of COVID-19 situation in a
number of advanced economies will likely slow their recoveries and may
hinder the revival of Hong Kong's exports," spokesman said.

"The development of China-US relations, geopolitical tensions and the
Brexit negotiations also warrant attention," spokesman added.
