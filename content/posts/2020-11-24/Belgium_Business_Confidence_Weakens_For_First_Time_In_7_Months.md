Belgium's [business][1] confidence deteriorated in November, after
strengthening in the previous six months, survey data from the National
Bank of Belgium showed on Tuesday.

The business confidence index fell to -12.1 from -8.5 in October.

The business climate deteriorated sharply in the trade sector in
particular, more than wiping out last month's clear rebound, as well as
in business-related services.

In the trade sector, demand forecasts collapsed, leading to an
anticipated reduction in orders placed with suppliers. Employment
opportunities also shrunk, but to a lesser extent.

In the business services sector, demand expectations weakened
significantly and entrepreneurs turned more pessimistic regarding the
business outlook.

The construction sector also logged an erosion in sentiment eroded,
while the manufacturing industry registered a modest improvement in
morale on a more positive view on the order books and employment
prospects.
