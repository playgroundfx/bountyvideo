British retailers expect sales volumes to be broadly flat in the year to
December with the nationwide lockdown due to end on December 2, the
Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation of British Industry
showed on Tuesday.

Although sales volumes decreased in November, online sales posted its
biggest growth in two years. The retail sales balance fell to -25
percent in November from -23 percent in October.

A balance of 55 percent said internet sales increased in November, the
fastest since October 2018.

Orders decreased in November, but at the slowest pace since December
2019. The balance came in at -10 percent versus -39 percent in October.
Orders are expected to fall at a similar pace next month.

"This month's survey gives hope that the economic impact of the Autumn
lockdowns should not be as severe as in the Spring," Ben Jones, CBI
principal economist, said.

Both consumers and firms are adapting as best they can, borne out in
this month's strong online sales.

With encouraging progress on mass, rapid testing and vaccine solutions
coming down the track, there is reason for growing consumer and
[business][1] confidence going into 2021, Jones added.
