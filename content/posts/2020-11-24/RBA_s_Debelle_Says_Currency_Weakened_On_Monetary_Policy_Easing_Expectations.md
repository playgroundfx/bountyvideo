The Australian dollar weakened against the US dollar due to the growing
expectations of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) package announced in November, Guy
Debelle, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said Tuesday.

Debelle said there were increased market expectations of a further
decline in the cash rate, ES rate and the bond yield target since mid-
September. Between then and early November, the currency depreciated
around 5 percent against the US dollar.

Early this month, RBA had reduced its key cash rate by 15 basis points
to a record low of 0.10 percent. Also, the bank raised its quantitative
easing measures.

He noted that the monetary easing measures have materially lowered the
structure of interest rates in the Australian financial system and
lowered the borrowing costs for households, businesses and the
government.

While the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about vaccines should help bolster that confidence, the
recovery will be uneven, the banker said. It is likely to be some time
before the vaccines will be widely available and distributed.
