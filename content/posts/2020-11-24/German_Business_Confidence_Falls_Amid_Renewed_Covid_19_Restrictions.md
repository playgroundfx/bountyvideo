German [business][1] sentiment deteriorated in November as companies
were more pessimistic about future amid the second wave of coronavirus
infections interrupting the economic recovery, survey results released
by the Munich-based ifo Institute showed on Tuesday.

The business climate index fell to 90.7 in November from revised 92.5 in
the previous month. The reading was forecast to ease to 90.1 from
October's initially estimated value of 92.7.

The decline was largely caused by more pessimistic view about the
future. The assessment of current situation also worsened a little in
November.

The current conditions index came in at 90.0 versus 90.4 a month ago.
Economists had forecast the score to drop to 87.0.

At the same time, the expectations index declined to 91.5 in November
from revised 94.7 in October. This was well below economists' forecast
of 93.5.

Business uncertainty has risen, Clemens Fuest, ifo President said. The
second wave of [coronavirus][2] has interrupted Germany's economic
recovery.

The survey suggested that the latest lockdown has dented the summer
optimism, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist, said. The only upside is
that more [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about a vaccine and a timetable to roll it out should
soon help to bring back this optimism.

Data released earlier in the day showed that the German [economy][3]
rebounded at a faster than expected pace in the third quarter,
offsetting a large part of the massive contraction in the second
quarter.

Gross domestic product grew 8.5 percent sequentially, reversing the 9.8
percent decline in the second quarter caused by the coronavirus
pandemic.  
  
The ifo survey revealed that manufacturing was the bright spot.
Companies assessing their current situation as markedly better. However,
expectations for the coming months turned notably less optimistic.

In services, business climate deteriorated notably in November. For the
first time since June, it was back in negative territory. Assessments of
the current situation were much less positive than they were. Moreover,
substantially more companies were pessimistic about months ahead.

Business climate worsened in trade as well. Companies were less content
with their current situation. Their expectations were thoroughly clouded
over, too.

In construction, business confidence fell somewhat. Companies'
assessments of their current business situation were slightly better
than in the previous month, while their expectations were more
pessimistic.
