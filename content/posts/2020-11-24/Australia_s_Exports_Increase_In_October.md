Australia's exports increased in October on record iron ore shipments,
preliminary data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed
Tuesday.

Exports grew 6 percent month-on-month to A$30.53 billion in October. On
a yearly basis, exports were down 3 percent in October.

Australia exported a record A$13.46 billion of metalliferous ores, the
majority of which was iron ore. Iron ore exports hit a record value of
A$10.9 billion.  
  
Shipment of gas advanced 18 percent, which was the first month-on-month
increase since March 2020. Meanwhile, exports of non-monetary gold were
down 12 percent and that of petroleum slid 24 percent.

Exports to China grew 7 percent as China continues to be the main export
destination for iron ore. Shipments to Japan and the USA rose 11 percent
and 5 percent, respectively.

Data showed that imports were up 8 percent in October from September but
declined 10 percent from the last year. Consequently, the trade balance
showed a surplus of A$4.84 billion versus A$5.02 billion in the previous
month.
