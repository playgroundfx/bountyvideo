After reporting sharp declines in leading U.S. economic indicators in
the two previous months, the Conference Board released a report on
Thursday showing its reading on leading indicators rebounded by more
than expected in the month of May.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index jumped by 2.8
percent in May after plunging by 6.1 percent in April and 7.5 percent in
March. Economists had expected the index to climb by 1.7 percent.

Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The
Conference Board, noted the rebound by the leading index was primarily
due to initial jobless claims pulling back well off the record high set
in late March.

"The improvements in labor [markets][1], housing permits, and stock
prices also buoyed the LEI, but new orders in manufacturing, consumers'
outlook on the [economy][2], and the Leading Credit Index still point to
weak economic conditions," Ozyildirim said.

He added, "The breadth and depth of the decline in the LEI between
February and April suggest the economy at large will remain in recession
territory in the near term."

The report said the coincident economic index increased by 1.1 percent
in May following the 10.4 percent nosedive in April.

Meanwhile, the Conference Board said the lagging economic index slumped
by 1.9 percent in May after jumping by 1.7 percent in April.
