Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity unexpected expanded in the
month of June, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current general activity
soared to a positive 27.5 in June from a negative 43.1 in May, with a
positive reading indicating an expansion in regional manufacturing
activity.

Economists had expected the index to show a much more modest increase to
a negative 23.0, which would have still indicated a contraction.
