The Bank of England increased its quantitative easing programme and left
its record low interest rate unchanged on Thursday.

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee headed by Andrew Bailey, decided to lift
the asset purchase programme by GBP 100 billion to GBP 745 billion.

Eight members including Bailey voted to raise the QE as they judged that
a further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is warranted to meet its statutory
objectives, while Andrew Haldane preferred to maintain the programme at
GBP 645 billion.

The MPC expects the programme to reach GBP 745 billion, around the turn
of the year.  
The nine-member committee unanimously decided to hold the interest rate
at 0.10 percent, as widely expected.

Policymakers said they are ready to take further action as required to
support the [economy][1] and ensure a sustained return of inflation to
the 2 percent target.

Inflation has fallen to 0.8 percent in April, triggering the explanatory
letter from the BoE Governor to the Chancellor alongside this monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement. Inflation then fell further to a four-year low of
0.5 percent in May.
