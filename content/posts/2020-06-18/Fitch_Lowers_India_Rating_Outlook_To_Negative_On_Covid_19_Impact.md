Fitch Ratings lowered India's sovereign rating outlook to 'negative'
from 'stable' on Thursday, citing the severe impact of the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic on the country's growth and
public finances outlook.  
  
The rating agency affirmed the country's rating at 'BBB-'.

"The coronavirus pandemic has significantly weakened India's growth
outlook for this year and exposed the challenges associated with a high
public-debt burden," Fitch said.

The rating agency forecast 5 percent contraction for the Indian
[economy][2] for this fiscal year ending March 2021, due to the strict
lockdown measures imposed since March 25. The economy is expected to
rebound by 9.5 percent in the next fiscal year.  
  
Despite pressing humanitarian and [health][3] needs, the government has
shown expenditure restraint so far, due to the already high public-debt
burden going into the crisis, with additional relief spending
representing only about 1 percent of GDP, Fitch estimated.

Further fiscal spending of up to 1 percentage point of GDP may still be
announced in the next few months, which was indicated by a recent
announcement of additional borrowing for the fiscal year 2021 of 2
percent of GDP, although we do not expect a steep rise in spending, the
agency added.

Latest official data showed that gross domestic product grew 3.1 percent
year-on-year in the three months to March compared to 5.7 percent in the
same period last year. The latest growth rate is the lowest in at least
eight years.

The Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates twice thus far this year
and the RBI governor has warned that growth is likely to be in negative
territory in the 2020-21, which would be the first contraction in four
decades.

Fitch also drew attention to rising geopolitical risks to the outlook in
the backdrop of the recent tensions on the borders with China and
Pakistan.  
  
"A stronger focus by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on its Hindu-
nationalist agenda since the government's re-election in May 2019 risks
becoming a distraction for economic reform implementation and could
further raise social tensions," Fitch warned.

The agency also cautioned that a structurally weaker real GDP growth
outlook, for instance due to continued financial-sector weakness or
reform implementation that is lacking, and a failure to reduce the
fiscal deficit after the pandemic recedes and to put the general
government debt/GDP ratio on downward path could attract a negative
rating action or downgrade.

India is still battling a severe spread of the coronavirus, or Covid-19,
especially in its commercial hub Mumbai. The country's capital New Delhi
and the southern state of Tamil Nadu are also among the worst hit
locations.

The government began easing the lockdown restrictions from May 18 in
areas where the number of cases is less.

Household consumption and investment have been severely hurt as economic
activity came to a standstill.

Economists are looking forward to significantly worse figures for the
second quarter as the country remained in total lockdown throughout
April and during the first half of May.
