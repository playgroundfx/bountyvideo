Switzerland's central bank kept its expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance
as it expects the [economy][1] to contract the most in over five decades
and inflation to remain more negative than forecast earlier, this year
due to the impact of the coronavirus, or Covid-19, and the lockdown
restrictions imposed to slow the pandemic.  
  
The Swiss National Bank left the key interest rate unchanged at -0.75
percent, in line with economists' expectations, and said it remains
willing to intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market due to
the high valuation for the Swiss franc.  
  
"The SNB's expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remains necessary to ensure
appropriate monetary conditions in Switzerland," the central bank said
in a statement.  
  
The central bank has provided banks with around CHF 10 billion in
liquidity at the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate since the launch of the Covid-19
refinancing facility.

SNB Governing Board Chairman Thomas Jordan said the bank's expansionary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has proved its worth and remains necessary. He hoped that the
worst phase of the Covid-19 pandemic is over, but said a difficult phase
of recovery lies ahead.  
  
Governor Jordan also said that the SNB has made substantial
interventions in the [forex][2] market since its March [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session
and these have helped to ease the upward pressure on the Swiss franc
somewhat.  
  
"We believe that it will try to wait until the crisis passes and the
uncertainty dissipates with a broadly unchanged monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," ING
economist Charlotte de Montepellier said.  
  
"For the time being, however, the SNB believes that the current
situation is manageable and will therefore continue to rely on its usual
instruments," the economist added.

The bank cut its inflation forecast for this year to -0.7 percent from
-0.3 percent seen in March, citing weaker growth prospects and lower oil
prices.  
  
The central bank said the economy is set to shrink around 6 percent this
year, which would be worst decline since the oil crisis of 1970s.  
The SNB hopes that any second wave of the [coronavirus][3] pandemic will
be successfully prevented globally.  
  
The Swiss economy is in a sharp recession and the slump in economic
output will be even more severe in the second quarter, the SNB said.  
The recent signals suggest that the economic activity again picked up
somewhat since May, the bank said. However, the bank sees only a partial
recovery for now and said the GDP will not return quickly to its pre-
crisis level.  
  
The economic revival seen for the second half of this year is likely to
be reflected in clearly positive growth in 2021, the bank said.  
  
Fritz Zurbrugg, vice-chairman of the Governing Board, said the two
globally-focussed Swiss banks - Credit Suisse and UBS, are well placed
to deal with the challenges posed by the economic crisis triggered by
the coronavirus pandemic. He also said that the domestically-focussed
Swiss banks' resilience is adequate overall.  
  
Andrea Maechler, a Governing Board member, said the financial market
situation and the currency market situation have improved since March,
but the uncertainty remains high.
