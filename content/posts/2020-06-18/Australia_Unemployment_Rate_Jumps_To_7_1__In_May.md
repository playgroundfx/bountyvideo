The jobless rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 7.1
percent in May, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday -
missing forecasts for 7.0 percent and up from the upwardly revised 6.4
percent in April (originally 6.2 percent).

The Australian [economy][1] shed 227,700 jobs last month - again missing
estimates for a decline of 125,000 following the loss of 594,300 in the
previous month.

The participation rate fell to 62.9 percent, missing expectations for
63.7 percent and down from 63.5 percent a month earlier.
