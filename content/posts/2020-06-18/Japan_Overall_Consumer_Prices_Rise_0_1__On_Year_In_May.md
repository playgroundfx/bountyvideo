Overall consumer prices in Japan were up 0.1 percent on year in May, the
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on Friday - in line
with expectations and unchanged from the April reading.

Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food prices, sank 0.2
percent on year. That missed expectations for a fall of 0.1 percent and
was unchanged from the previous month's reading.

Individually, annual prices were up for food, housing, furniture,
clothing and medical care; prices were down for fuel, transportation and
education.

On a monthly basis, both overall inflation and core CPI were flat.
