Italy's trade balance swung to a deficit in April, as exports decreased
faster than imports, amid the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, data from the
statistical office Istat showed on Thursday.

The trade balance registered a deficit of EUR 1.16 billion in April
versus a surplus of EUR 2.85 billion in the same period last year. In
March, the trade surplus was EUR 5.68 billion.

Exports decreased 41.6 percent year-on-year in April, following a 13.4
percent fall in March.

On an annual basis, imports fell 33.7 percent in April, following an
18.1 percent decrease in the preceding month.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, exports fell 34.9 percent and imports
declined 18.5 percent monthly.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the construction
output decreased a record 51.5 percent month-on-month in April,
following a 36.4 percent decline in March.

On a yearly basis, construction output declined 67.8 percent in April,
following a 35.5 percent fall in the prior month.

The construction output declined the most since the survey began in
1995, on both yearly and monthly basis, the agency said.
