Switzerland's central bank kept its expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance
as it expects the [economy][1] to contract the most in over five decades
and inflation to remain more negative than forecast earlier, this year
due to the impact of the coronavirus, or Covid-19, and the lockdown
restrictions imposed to slow the pandemic.  
  
The Swiss National Bank left the key interest rate unchanged at -0.75
percent, in line with economists' expectations, and said it remains
willing to intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market due to
the high valuation for the Swiss franc.  
  
"The SNB's expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remains necessary to ensure
appropriate monetary conditions in Switzerland," the central bank said
in a statement.  
  
The bank cut its inflation forecast for this year to -0.7 percent from
-0.3 percent seen in March, citing weaker growth prospects and lower oil
prices.  
  
The central bank said the economy is set to shrink around 6 percent this
year, which would be worst decline since the oil crisis of 1970s.  
  
The SNB hopes that any second wave of the [coronavirus][2] pandemic will
be successfully prevented globally.  
  
The Swiss economy is in a sharp recession and the slump in economic
output will be even more severe in the second quarter, the SNB said.
