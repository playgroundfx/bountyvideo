The private sector in Singapore continued to contract in October, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economic showed on
Wednesday with a nine-month high seasonally adjusted PMI score of 48.6.

That's up from 45.1 in September, although it remains beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output returned to growth and demand weakened at a slower
pace. Business sentiment remained positive.

With sales still declining, albeit at a slower pace, firms continued to
face with spare capacity, as reflected by a further decline in backlogs
of work. This in turn weighed on hiring as companies sought to control
costs.
