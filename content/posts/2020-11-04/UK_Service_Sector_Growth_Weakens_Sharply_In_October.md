The UK service sector growth weakened sharply in October as tightening
restrictions amid rising Covid-19 infections dampened activity in the
hospitality, transport and leisure sectors, final survey data from IHS
Markit showed Wednesday.  
  
The services Purchasing Managers' Index declined to 51.4 in October from
56.1 in the previous month. But the score was crucially above the 50.0
no-change mark but below the flash 52.3.

November's lockdown in England and a worsening Covid-19 situation across
the rest of Europe means that the UK [economy][1] seems on course for a
double-dip recession this winter and a far more challenging path to
recovery in 2021, Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.

The moderate expansion in October was driven by a continued recovery in
[business][2] operations after the national lockdown period during the
second quarter of 2020 and the restart of work on delayed projects.

There was a drop in new orders for the first time since June. The
overall figure masked a slump in demand for customer-facing service
providers, especially those in the hotels, restaurants and catering
category.

Reduced volumes of new business resulted in lower backlogs in October.
Further, the survey showed another fall in employment reflecting
redundancies in response to shrinking revenues during the pandemic.

Margins were under pressure from a solid increase in average cost
burdens. At the same time, output prices dropped for the second month
amid discounting to stimulate sales.

Although service providers were optimistic overall about their prospects
for growth in the next 12 months, the degree of confidence slipped to
its lowest since May.

The overall private sector continued to expand in October but at the
slowest pace in four months. At 52.1, the composite output index dropped
from 56.5 in September.
