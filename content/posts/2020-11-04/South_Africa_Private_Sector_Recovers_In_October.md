South Africa's private sector expanded for the first time in one-
and-a-half years in October, as the Covid-19 restrictions eased, survey
data from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.0 in October from
49.4 in September. The reading rose for the fifth consecutive month. Any
reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Overall [business][1] conditions increased in both new orders and output
in October.

New business expanded for the first time in twenty-eight months, while
new export orders declined. New business from abroad was the slowest
since the pandemic hit.

Business activity increased for the first time in one-and-a-half years
to the greatest extend since December 2016.

Employment continued to decline in October and the pace of reduction
slowed to the weakest for seven months. Backlogs of works depletion
softened and suppliers' delivery time lengthened.

Purchase price increased at a sharp pace in October and the fastest for
six months and selling prices rose to the greatest extend since
February.

Business confidence remained remained broadly unchanged in October, as
hopes for an end to the Covid-19 pandemic.

"The latest data suggest that GDP could grow again during the final
three months of 2020, following an anticipated 'mechanical' rebound in
the third quarter," Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit,
said.

"That said, caution is provided by the situation in other parts of the
world where a second wave of the virus has occurred," Harker said.
