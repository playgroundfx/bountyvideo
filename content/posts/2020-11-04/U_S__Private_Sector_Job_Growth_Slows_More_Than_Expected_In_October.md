Private sector employment in the U.S. increased by much less than
expected in the month of October, according to a report released by
payroll processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 365,000 jobs in October after
spiking by an upwardly revised 753,000 jobs in September.

Economists had expected private sector employment to surge by 650,000
jobs compared to the jump of 749,000 jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

"The labor market continues to add jobs, yet at a slower pace," said Ahu
Yildirmaz, vice president and cohead of the ADP Research Institute.
"Although the pace is slower, we've seen employment gains across all
industries and sizes."

The report said employment in the service-providing sector spiked by
348,000 jobs, while employment in the goods-producing sector edged up by
17,000.

Employment at mid-sized businesses climbed by 135,000 jobs, and
employment at large and small businesses increased by 116,000 jobs and
114,000 jobs, respectively.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched report on employment in the month of October.

Employment is expected to increase by about 600,000 jobs in October
after climbing by 661,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate is
expected to edge down to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent.
