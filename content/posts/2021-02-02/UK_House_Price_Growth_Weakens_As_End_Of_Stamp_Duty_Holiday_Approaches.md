UK house price growth slowed for the first time in six months in January
ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday in March, data from the
Nationwide Building Society showed on Tuesday.

House prices climbed 6.4 percent on a yearly basis, but weaker than the
7.3 percent increase logged in December. Economists had forecast an
annual growth of 6.9 percent.

This was the first time that house price growth weakened in the current
sequence of growth that started in July.

On a monthly basis, house prices fell 0.3 percent, in contrast to a 0.9
percent rise seen in December and confounding expectations for an
increase of 0.3 percent. This was the first monthly decline since June.

To a large extent, the slowdown probably reflects a tapering of demand
ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday, which prompted many people
considering a house move to bring forward their purchase, Robert
Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said.

"Looking ahead, shifts in housing preferences are likely to continue to
provide some support for the market. However, if the stamp duty holiday
ends as scheduled, and labor market conditions continue to weaken as
most analysts expect, housing market activity is likely to slow, perhaps
sharply, in the coming months, said Gardner.

The drop in house prices is an early sign of the reversal in the 2020
house price surge, Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

The economist expects house prices to dip by 4 percent this year as
transaction volumes thin out after the stamp duty holiday and a further
rise in unemployment leads to a moderate increase in forced sales, the
economist.

Although the [economy][1] was around 10 percent smaller than at the
start of 2020, and the unemployment rate around a percentage point
higher, the total number of mortgages approved for house purchases in
2020 exceeded the 2019 level and house price inflation ended the year at
a six-year high, Nationwide said.

According to the latest English Housing Survey published by the
government, there was a slight increase in the home ownership rate in
2020, to 64.6 percent from 63.8 percent in 2019. This was the third year
in a row that the home ownership rate has increased.
