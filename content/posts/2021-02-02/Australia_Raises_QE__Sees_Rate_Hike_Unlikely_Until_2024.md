At the first meeting of the year, Australia's central bank raised the
size of its asset purchase programme and signaled that it will not hike
interest rates until 2024.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided on Tuesday to leave its cash rate unchanged at a
record low of 0.10 percent.

The central bank retained the target yield on the 3-year Australian
government bond at around 0.1 percent and also maintained the parameters
of the Term Funding Facility.

But, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers decided to buy an additional A$100 billion of bonds
issued by the Australian government and states and territories when the
program is completed in mid-April. These additional purchases will be at
the current rate of A$5 billion a week.

"The board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is
sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. For this to occur,
wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently,"
the bank said.

This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a
tight labor market. The board does not expect these conditions to be met
until 2024 at the earliest, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers observed.

Both inflation and wages growth are forecast to pick up, but to do so
only gradually, with both remaining below 2 percent over the next couple
of years, the board said. In underlying [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), inflation is expected to
be 1.25 percent over 2021 and 1.5 percent over 2022.

Policymakers expect the economic recovery to continue, with the central
scenario being for GDP to grow by 3.5 percent over both 2021 and 2022.
GDP is expected to return to its end-2019 level by the middle of this
year.

Nonetheless, the [economy][1] is set to operate with considerable spare
capacity for some time to come, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers noted.

The unemployment rate is forecast to fall, and the central scenario is
for unemployment to be around 6 percent at the end of this year and 5.5
percent at the end of 2022.

More upbeat forecasts for GDP growth, the labor market and inflation
suggest that the bank could end its asset purchases later this year,
though the Bank's renewed focus on slow-moving developments in inflation
and wage growth may trigger a further extension, Marcel Thieliant, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.
