The Czech economic growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of 2020
as a resurgence in [coronavirus][1] infections damped activity in
Europe, preliminary data showed Tuesday.  
  
Seasonally adjusted gross domestic product grew 0.3 percent from the
third quarter, when it rose 6.9 percent. That defied economists'
expectation for a decline of 2.5 percent.  
  
The [economy][2] expanded for a second quarter in a row.  
  
GDP decreased 5 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter after a 5.3
percent decline in the previous three months. Economists had forecast a
7.7 percent fall.  
  
The decrease was caused mainly by a deepening slump in consumption
expenditure of households, whereas external demand was significantly
increasing, the agency said.

The economy shrank 5.6 percent for the full year 2020, logging the
deepest slump in economic performance in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the independent
Czech Republic.

The decline was influenced mainly by household consumption, investment
expenditure and also by a slump in external demand in the first half-
year when the coronavirus pandemic spread. The general government
expenditure grew.
