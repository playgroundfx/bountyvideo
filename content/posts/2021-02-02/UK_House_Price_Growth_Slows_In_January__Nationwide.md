UK house prices growth slowed in January for the first time in six
months, data from the Nationwide Building Society showed on Tuesday.

House prices climbed 6.4 percent on a yearly basis, but weaker than the
7.3 percent increase logged in December. Economists had forecast an
annual growth of 6.9 percent.

On a monthly basis, house prices fell 0.3 percent, in contrast to a 0.9
percent rise seen in December and confounding expectations for an
increase of 0.3 percent. This was the first monthly decline since June.

To a large extent, the slowdown probably reflects a tapering of demand
ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday, which prompted many people
considering a house move to bring forward their purchase, Robert
Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said.  
  
While the stamp duty holiday is not due to expire until the end of
March, activity would be expected to weaken well before that, given that
the purchase process typically takes several months, the economist
added.
