The services sector in New Zealand continued to expand in July at a
steady pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ showed on Monday with a
Performance of Services Index score of 54.3.

That's unchanged from the June reading following an upward revision from
54.1, and it remains above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates
expansion from contraction.

Individually, the indices for sales, deliveries, stocks and mew orders
were all in expansion territory, while employment was just beneath the
line and contracted.

"Comments from those in the services sector still place COVID-19 front
and center in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of negative influences, with recovery comments a key
feature of positive influences. With uncertainty ahead, we need to take
results month by month," said BusinessNZ chief executive Kirk Hope.
