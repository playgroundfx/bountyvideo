China is scheduled to release a batch of data on Monday, headlining a
modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. On tap are Q4 numbers for
gross domestic product, as well as December data for industrial
production, retail sales, unemployment and fixed asset investment.

GDP is expected to rise 3.2 percent on quarter and 6.1 percent on year
after gaining 2.7 percent on quarter and 4.9 percent on year in the
three months prior.

Industrial production is tipped to add 6.9 percent on year after rising
7.0 percent in November. Retail sales are pegged at 5.5 percent, up from
5.0 percent in the previous month. Fixed Asset Investment is expected to
advanced an annual 3.2 percent, up from 2.6 percent a month earlier. The
jobless rate in November was 5.2 percent.

Japan will see final November numbers for industrial production; the
previous reading suggested an increase of 4.0 percent on month and a
decline of 3.0 percent on year, with a 6.0 percent gain in capacity
utilization.

Singapore will provide December data for non-oil domestic exports, with
forecasts suggesting an increase of 3.6 percent on month and 0.3 percent
on year. That follows the 3.8 percent monthly decline and the 4.9
percent annual drop in November, when the trade balance was 3.93 billion
Singapore dollars.
