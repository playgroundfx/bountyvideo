Hungary's central bank raised its key interest rate for the first time
in nearly a decade as inflation continue to remain above the target.

The Monetary Council of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank on Tuesday decided to
lift the benchmark base rate by 30 basis points to 0.90 percent from
0.60 percent.

Economists had expected a hike to 0.85 percent. The previous change in
the rate was a 15-basis point cut in July 2020.

The latest hike in the base rate was the first since December 2011, when
it was raised by 50 basis points to 7.00 percent.  
  
The overnight central bank deposit rate was retained at -0.05 percent
and the one-week collateralized loan rate was maintained at 1.85
percent.

In May, consumer price inflation held steady at 5.1 percent, well above
the central bank's tolerance band of 2 percent to 4 percent.

The extent of inflationary pressures building from goods shortages and
the re-opening of services sectors is clearly making the MNB feel
uncomfortable and it now feels the need to start tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to
address these risks and safeguard inflation expectations, Liam Peach, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

With the recovery set to strengthen and inflation likely to increase
further in the coming quarters, additional interest rate hikes are
likely in the second half of this year, the economist added.
