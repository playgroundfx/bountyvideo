Eurozone consumer confidence strengthened for a fifth month in a row in
June to its highest level since early 2018, preliminary data from the
European Commission showed Tuesday.

The flash consumer confidence index rose to -3.3 from -5.1 in May.
Economists had forecast a score of -3.0.

The latest reading was the highest since January 2018, when it was -3.0

The confidence index for EU also improved for a fifth straight month,
climbing 1.5 points to -4.5. That was the highest reading since October
2018, when it was at the same level.

Data for the survey was collected from June 1 to 21.

The final figures for June are set to be released along with the monthly
economic sentiment survey results due on June 29.
