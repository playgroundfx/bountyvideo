Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to appear before the
House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis later Tuesday to
discuss the central bank's response to the pandemic.

In prepared remarks, Powell noted the [economy][1] has shown sustained
improvement since he last appeared before the committee, citing
widespread Covid-19 vaccinations as well as unprecedented monetary and
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions.

"Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to
strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its
fastest rate of increase in decades," Powell said.

"Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounce back in
activity from depressed levels," he added. "The sectors most adversely
affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have shown improvement."

Labor market conditions have continued to improve along with overall
economic activity, Powell said, although he noted the pace has been
uneven.

Powell said the 5.8 percent unemployment rate in May understates the
shortfall in employment, particularly as labor market participation has
not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past
year.

"Job gains should pick up in coming months as vaccinations rise, easing
some of the pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down," he
said.

Powell acknowledged inflation has increased notably in recent months but
reiterated the view that the jump is due to "transitory" factors and
predicted inflation would drop back toward the Fed's longer-run goal of
2 percent price growth.

The Fed chief warned the [coronavirus][2] pandemic continues to pose
risks to the economic outlook, pointing to the slowing pace of
vaccinations and new strains of the virus.

Powell stressed that the Fed will do "everything we can to support the
economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery."

The testimony by Powell comes after the latest projections from the Fed
pointed to an increase in interest rates in 2023.

The latest projections from Fed officials released last Wednesday
suggest interest rates will be increased to 0.6 percent in 2023 compared
to previous projections indicating rates would remain at near-zero
levels.
