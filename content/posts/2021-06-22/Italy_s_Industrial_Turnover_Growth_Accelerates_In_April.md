Italy's industrial turnover increased at the fastest pace in eight
months in April, data from the statistical office Istat showed on
Tuesday.

Industrial turnover grew 3.3 percent month-on-month in April, following
March's 1.7 percent increase. This was the fastest growth since August
2020.

Domestic turnover advanced 4 percent, faster than the 2.3 percent growth
posted in March. Likewise, growth in foreign turnover improved to 1.7
percent from 0.7 percent.  
  
Turnover of capital goods and energy grew 6.1 percent and 4 percent,
respectively. Intermediate goods turnover was up 3.3 percent. Meanwhile,
consumer goods turnover was down 0.1 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial turnover surged 105.1 percent after
expanding 37.9 percent in the previous month. The annual growth was
driven by the extremely low figure of April 2020.

Domestic turnover increased 114.7 percent and foreign turnover expanded
87.8 percent in April.
