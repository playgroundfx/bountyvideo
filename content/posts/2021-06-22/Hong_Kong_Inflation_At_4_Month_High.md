Hong Kong consumer price inflation accelerated to a four-month high in
May, data published by the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Tuesday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 1 percent in May from 0.8 percent in
April. This was the highest rate since last January, when prices were up
2.6 percent.

Netting out the effects of all government's one-off relief measures, the
underlying inflation rate came in at 0.2 percent, marginally larger than
the 0.1 percent rise in April.

The annual inflation was largely driven by higher costs for meals out
and takeaway food and the smaller decreases in fresh vegetable prices.

While external price pressures may intensify somewhat in the near term
along with a rise in global inflation, overall inflation should remain
largely contained as the local [economy][1] is still operating below
capacity, a government spokesman, said.
