A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed U.S.
[business][1] inventories increased in line with economist estimates in
the month of May.

The Commerce Department said business inventories rose by 0.5 percent in
May following a revised 0.1 percent uptick in April.

Economists had expected business inventories to climb by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.2 percent dip originally reported for the previous
month.

The increase in business inventories came as wholesale inventories
jumped by 1.3 percent and manufacturing inventories advanced by 0.9
percent, more than offsetting a 0.8 percent drop in retail inventories.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department business sales fell by 0.3 percent in
May after climbing by 0.6 percent in April.

The pullback in business sales came as retail sales tumbled by 2.4
percent, while wholesale and manufacturing sales rose by 0.8 percent and
0.7 percent, respectively.

With inventories rising and sales falling, the total business
inventories/sales ratio inched up to 1.26 in May from 1.25 in April.
