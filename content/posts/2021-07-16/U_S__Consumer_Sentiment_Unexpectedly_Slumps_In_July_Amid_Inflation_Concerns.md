Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has unexpectedly seen a significant
deterioration in the month of July, according to preliminary data
released by the University of Michigan on Friday.

The report showed the consumer sentiment index slumped to 80.8 in July
from 85.5 in June. The decrease surprised economists, who had expected
the index to inch up to 86.5.

Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin said the unexpected
drop by the headline was largely due to less favorable prospects for the
national [economy][1], with the index of consumer expectations tumbling
to 78.4 in July from 83.5 in June.

"This decline was caused by a misjudgement by consumers in the pace that
the economy would recover as the pandemic eased," Curtin said. "This
involved both underestimating the economy's ability to reactivate supply
lines and restore jobs, and the resulting impact on inflation."

"Rather than job creation, halting and reversing an accelerating
inflation rate has now become a top concern," he added, noting that
inflation has put added pressure on living standards and caused
postponement of large discretionary purchases.

One-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.8 percent in July from 4.2
in June, while five-year inflation expectations inched up to 2.9 percent
from 2.8 percent.

The report also showed a notable decrease by the current economic
conditions index, which slid to 84.5 in July from 88.6 in June.

"Small [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) steps could now have a large impact on ending inflationary
psychology," Curtin said. "A slight increase in interest rates would be
no surprise to consumers as 70% expected an increase in early July."
