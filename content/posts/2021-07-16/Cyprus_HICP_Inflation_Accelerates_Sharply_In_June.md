Cyprus' harmonized inflation accelerated strongly in June to its highest
level in over eight-and-a-half years, preliminary figures from the
statistical office showed Friday.

Inflation, based on the harmonized index of consumer prices or HICP,
rose to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent in May. The latest inflation rate
was the highest since October 2012, when it was 2.6 percent.

The biggest increase of 8.4 percent was logged in each of the transport
and utilities & fuels components.

Compared to the previous month, the HICP rose 1.0 percent in June.
Prices in restaurant and hotels rose 2.5 percent and those in clothing
and footwear grew 2.2 percent.

For the January - June period, the HICP grew 0.6 percent from a year
ago.
