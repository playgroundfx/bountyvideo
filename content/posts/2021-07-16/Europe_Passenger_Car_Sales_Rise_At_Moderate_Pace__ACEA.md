Europe's passenger car registrations increased at a moderate pace in
June, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or
ACEA, showed on Friday.

Car registrations increased 10.4 percent year-on-year in June, but
slower than the 53.4 percent growth posted in May.

Among the major EU car [markets][1], Germany posted the biggest gain
with a 24.5 percent increase. Sales in Spain were up 17.1 percent and
that in Italy advanced 12.6 percent. In France, by contrast, passenger
car sales contracted 14.7 percent.

Over the first half of 2021, EU demand for new cars grew by 25.2 percent
and sales reached almost 5.4 million units. However, this was still 1.5
million units below the pre-COVID volume recorded over the first six
months of 2019.
