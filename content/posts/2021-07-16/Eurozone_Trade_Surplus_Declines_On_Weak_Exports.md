The euro area trade surplus declined in May on weak foreign demand,
official data from Eurostat revealed on Friday.

The trade surplus fell to a seasonally adjusted EUR 9.4 billion in May
from EUR 13.4 billion in April.

Exports dropped 1.5 percent on a monthly basis in May, while imports
grew 0.7 percent.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade balance showed a surplus of EUR 7.5
billion in May compared to EUR 8.9 billion surplus in the same period
last year.

Shipments increased 31.9 percent from May 2020, a month which had been
heavily affected by the COVID-19 containment measures widely introduced
by the member states. Imports advanced 35.2 percent annually.
