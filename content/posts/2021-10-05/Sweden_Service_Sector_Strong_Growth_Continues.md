Sweden's services sector grew at the second fastest pace on record in
September, leading to more jobs, survey data from Swedbank and Silf
showed Tuesday.

The purchasing managers' index for the services sector climbed to 69.6
from 65.1 in August. That was the second highest reading in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
of the index.

The expansion in the service sector continues at high speed, which has
also contributed to an increased need for new employment as well,
Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

All sub-indices rose in September with the measures for order intake and
delivery times accounting for the largest contributions to the rise in
PMI services.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
68.2 in September from 63.7 in August, driven by the service sector.

The reading was the second highest in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the index, which
shows a strong economic upturn in the [business][1] sector, which can
gain further momentum now when the Covid restrictions have been removed,
Kennemar added.
