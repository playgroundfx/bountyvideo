Overall consumer prices in the Philippines were up 4.8 percent on year
in September, the National Statistics Office said on Tuesday.

That was shy of expectations for 5.1 percent and down from 4.9 percent
in August.

On a monthly basis, inflation was flat - again missing forecasts for an
increase of 0.3 percent and slowing sharply from 0.6 percent in the
previous month.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, was up 3.3 percent on
year. That also missed expectations for 3.35 percent but was unchanged
from the August reading.
