A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the U.S.
trade deficit widened by much more than expected in the month of August.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to a record $73.3
billion in August from a revised $70.3 billion in July.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to increase to $70.5 billion
from the $70.1 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider trade deficit came amid a jump in the value of imports, which
surged up by 1.4 percent to $287.0 billion.

Significant increases in imports of pharmaceutical preparations and
industrial supplies and materials more than offset a decrease in imports
of passenger cars.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the value of exports rose by 0.5
percent during the month to $213.7 billion.

A spike in exports of industrial supplies and materials was partly
offset by decreases in exports of automotive vehicles, parts, and
engines, capital goods and foods, feeds and beverages.

The report also showed the goods deficit widened to $89.4 billion in
August, while the services surplus contracted to $16.2 billion.

"Moderating domestic demand will continue to slow import volumes over
the coming months, while a steady pick up in foreign consumption will
drive stronger exports in Q4," said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

He added, "However, with global growth being constrained by persistent
supply disruptions and uneven vaccine diffusion, we expect the trade
deficit will widen slightly further by year-end."
