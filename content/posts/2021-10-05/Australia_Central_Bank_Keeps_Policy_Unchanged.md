Australia's central bank left its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged as widely
expected and vowed to hold its interest rate at a historic low until
2024.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a record low of
0.10 percent.

The board maintained the target of 10 basis points for the April 2024
Australian Government bond. The board also voted to continue with the
purchase of government securities at the rate of A$4 billion a week
until at least mid February 2022.

The bank repeated that it will not increase the cash rate until actual
inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. The
central scenario for the [economy][1] is that this condition will not be
met before 2024.

Although the bank stuck to its guns by predicting that rates won't rise
until 2024, high inflation will prompt rate hikes in 2023, Marcel
Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The setback to the economic expansion caused by the Delta outbreak is
set to be only temporary, the board noted. As vaccination rates increase
further and restrictions are eased, the economy is expected to bounce
back.

Nonetheless, the board assessed that there is uncertainty about the
timing and pace of the bounce-back and it is likely to be slower than
that earlier in the year.

The bank forecast the economy to grow again in the December quarter and
is expected to be back around its pre-Delta path in the second half of
next year.

Policymakers observed that housing credit growth has picked up due to
stronger demand for credit by both owner-occupiers and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

The Council of Financial Regulators has been discussing the medium-term
risks to macroeconomic stability of rapid credit growth at a time of
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low interest rates, the bank said. It is important that
lending standards are maintained and that loan serviceability buffers
are appropriate.
