The private sector in Singapore picked up steam in September, the latest
survey from Markit Economics revealed on Tuesday with a PMI score of
53.8.

That's up from 52.1 in August, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The easing of COVID-19 restrictions in August kept demand improving into
September as both [business][1] activity and new orders sustained growth
at faster rates in the latest survey. Underlying data pointed to the
transport, information & communications technology sector experiencing
the fastest growth in orders. This was also supported by foreign demand
as overall export orders picked up at the fastest rate since April 2018.

That said, firms remained cautious with their buying activity which
declined in September, contributing to lower levels of inputs held in
stock. Despite the increase in overall demand, uncertainty with regards
to the COVID-19 virus held private sector firms back in their
stockpiling efforts.
