India's service sector grew at a softer pace in September, survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 55.2 in September from
56.7 in August. Economists had forecast the index to rise to 57.0.

A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

New [business][1] inflow increased in September and employment growth
ended in a nine-month sequence of job shedding. Outstanding business
declined for the second straight month in September.

The overall rate of inflation eased to the lowest in eight months in
September and selling prices increased.

The business confidence weakened in September, while output was expected
to expand in the next 12 months.

New export business declined for the nineteenth straight month in
September.

The overall private sector [economy][2] continued to expand, albeit at a
softer pace. The composite output index eased to 55.3 in September from
55.4 in the previous month.

"Indian companies continued to benefit from a recovery in demand as the
pandemic receded further and restrictions were lifted," Pollyanna De
Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.
