The UK private sector growth eased sharply in August largely due to
staff shortages and supply chain issues, flash survey results from IHS
Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed on
Monday.

The flash composite output index decreased to a six-month low of 55.3 in
August from 59.2 in July. The score was forecast to drop to 58.4.

Weaker recoveries were seen in both the manufacturing and service
sectors. The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 55.5 from 59.6
in July. The expected level was 59.0.

The manufacturing PMI came in at a five-month low of 60.1 versus 60.4 in
the previous month. The reading was forecast to drop to 59.5.

New order growth eased only slightly in August, the survey showed.
Efforts to rebuild capacity and strong optimism towards the
[business][1] outlook contributed to the fastest rise in employment
numbers since the index began in January 1998.

Nonetheless, backlogs of work increased for the sixth month in a row as
businesses struggled to keep up with customer demand.

Inflationary pressures showed signs of easing in August, with input
prices rising at the weakest pace for three months.

Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS, said "An abnormally large slowdown
in overall activity in August offers a stark warning to the UK
[economy][2] that the accelerated levels of growth we've seen earlier
this summer are not sustainable."

"The large fall in the composite PMI suggests that the economic recovery
might be slowing a bit faster than we had thought," Kieran Tompkins, an
economist at Capital Economics, said. "That poses a downside risk to our
forecast for the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level by October,
the economist added."
