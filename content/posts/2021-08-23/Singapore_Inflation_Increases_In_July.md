Singapore's consumer prices increased marginally in July, data from the
Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry
showed on Monday.

The consumer price index rose 2.5 percent year-on-year in July,
following a 2.4 percent increase in June. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

This latest consumer prices outcome was largely due to a rise in prices
for core inflation and accommodation cost.

MAS core CPI, which excludes costs of accommodation and private road
transport, increased 1.0 percent annually in July, following a 0.6
percent increase in the preceding month.

The statistical office expects external inflation to rise in the coming
quarters, amid a recovery in global oil prices and cost of intermediate
goods to final consumer prices.

Domestic cost pressures are expected to stay higher, while wage growth
and commercial rent are expected to stay low.

For 2021, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average 0-1 percent, while
the CPI-All Items inflation is expected to come between 1-2 percent.
