Austria's manufacturing sector recovery gained strength in October
driven by a sharp increase in new orders, survey results from IHS Markit
showed Wednesday.

The headline UniCredit Bank Austria Manufacturing Purchasing Managers'
Index rose to 54.0 in October from 51.7 in September. This was the
highest reading in almost two years.

New orders logged its strongest growth since January 2018 as demand from
domestic and foreign [markets][1] improved further.

On the back of robust demand, production levels were raised, which in
turn led to a pick-up in firms' purchasing activity and modest
inflationary pressure on both input costs and output prices.

Still, goods producers continued to trim workforce numbers amid efforts
to save costs.

The survey showed a slight drop in manufacturers' optimism towards the
outlook for activity over the next 12 months.
