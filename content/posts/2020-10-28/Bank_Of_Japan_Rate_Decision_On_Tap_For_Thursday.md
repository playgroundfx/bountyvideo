The Bank of Japan will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting and then
announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a busy day for
Asia-Pacific economic activity. The central bank is widely expected to
keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at -0.1 percent although it
may introduce other forms of stimulus.

Japan also will release September figures for retail sales and October
figures for consumer confidence. In August, retail sales gained 4.6
percent on month and fell 1.9 percent on year, while the consumer
confidence index score in September was 32.7.

Australia will see Q3 numbers for import and export prices; in the three
months prior, import prices were down 1.9 percent on quarter and export
prices were down 2.4 percent.

Singapore will provide September figures for import and export prices
and producer prices, as well as preliminary Q3 data for unemployment. In
August, import prices were down 6.8 percent on year, export prices
dropped 8.2 percent on year and producer prices tumbled 9.4 percent on
year. In the previous three months, the jobless rate was 2.8 percent.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Malaysia and Indonesia are closed on
