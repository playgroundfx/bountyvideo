Consumer prices in Australia were up 0.7 percent on year in the third
quarter of 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday -
in line with expectations following the 0.3 percent decline in the
previous three months.

On a quarterly basis, inflation climbed 1.6 percent - exceeding
expectations for 1.5 percent following the 1.9 percent contraction in
the three months prior.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's trimmed mean was up 0.4 percent on
quarter and 1.2 percent on year after slipping 0.1 percent on quarter
and gaining 1.2 percent on year in Q2.

The RBA's weighted median was up 0.3 percent on quarter and 1.3 percent
on year after rising 0.1 percent on quarter and 1.3 percent on year in
the previous three months.
