Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will warn members of the Senate
Banking Committee about upside risks to inflation during testimony on
Tuesday.

In prepared remarks, Powell predicted inflation will remain elevated in
the coming months before moderating.

"As the [economy][1] continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are
seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly due to supply bottlenecks
in some sectors," Powell said.

He added, "These effects have been larger and longer lasting than
anticipated, but they will abate, and as they do, inflation is expected
to drop back toward our longer-run 2 percent goal."

Powell warned supply bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other
constraints could prove to be greater and more enduring as the economic
reopening continues, posing upside risks to inflation.

"If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we
would certainly respond and use our tools to ensure that inflation runs
at levels that are consistent with our goal," the Fed chief said.

Powell also noted that the economy has continued to strengthen since he
last appeared before the committee but acknowledged the recent rise in
Covid-19 cases has slowed the recovery in the sectors most adversely
affected by the pandemic.

While noting labor market conditions have also continued to improve,
Powell said, "Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs
and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment
growth" but predicted these factors would diminish amid continued
progress on containing the virus.

Powell stressed that the Fed would continue to "do all we can to support
the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery."

The comments from Powell come after recent indications the Fed plans to
begin scaling back its asset purchases in the near future.
