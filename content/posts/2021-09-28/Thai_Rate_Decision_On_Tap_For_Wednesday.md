The central bank in Thailand will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on
Wednesday and then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting
a light day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The central bank is
widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 0.50
percent.

Thailand also will see August figures for industrial production, with
forecasts suggesting a flat reading following the 5.12 percent increase
in July.

Singapore will release August numbers for import prices, export prices
and producer prices. In July, import prices were up 12.5 percent on
year, export prices gained 13.0 percent on year and producer prices
surged 17.0 percent on year.
