Hong Kong's merchandise exports grew at a softer pace in August, data
from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Tuesday.

Exports rose 25.9 percent year-on-year in August, after a 26.9 percent
increase in July.

Imports gained 28.1 percent annually in August, after a 26.1 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit widened to HK$26.298 billion in August from HK$14.626
billion in the same month last year. In July, the deficit was HK$34.981
billion.

"Looking ahead, the global economic recovery and vibrant regional trade
flows should continue to support Hong Kong's export performance in the
near term," a government spokesman said.

"Other risk factors such as China-US relations and heightened
geopolitical tensions also warrant attention. The Government will
monitor the situation closely," spokesman said.
