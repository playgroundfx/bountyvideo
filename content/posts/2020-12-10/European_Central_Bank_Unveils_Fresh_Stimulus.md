European Central Bank announced a fresh round of stimulus in the form of
more asset purchases and ultra cheap loans to banks, on Thursday to
support the euro area [economy][1] amid the heightened uncertainty
surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.  
  
"The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures taken today will contribute to preserving
favorable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby
supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy,
underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price
stability," the ECB said in a statement.

"At the same time, uncertainty remains high, including with regard to
the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs."

Policymakers will continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate,
and they stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate,
to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in
line with its commitment to symmetry, the bank said.

Delivering on its promise of a reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)tion of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
instruments, the ECB increased the size of its pandemic emergency
purchase programme, or PEPP, by EUR 500 billion to a total of EUR 1,850
billion.  
  
The horizon for net purchases under the PEPP was extended to at least
the end of March 2022. The bank said the Governing Council will conduct
net purchases until it judges that the [coronavirus][2] crisis phase is
over.

The reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities
purchased under the PEPP was extended until at least till the end of
2023. The future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid
interference with the appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, the bank
reiterated.  
  
Policymakers also decided to further reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)te the conditions of the
third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations or TLTRO III
and decided to extend the period over which considerably more favorable
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) will apply by twelve months, to June 2022.

The ECB also said it will conduct three additional TLTRO III operations
between June and December 2021.  
  
Further, the bank raised the borrowing limit for counterparties in TLTRO
III operations from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of their stock of
eligible loans.

The central bank also said that the reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted TLTRO III borrowing
conditions will be made available only to banks that achieve a new
lending performance target. This is meant to provide an incentive for
banks to sustain the current level of bank lending.  
  
In its previous meeting on October 29, ECB President Christine Lagarde
had clearly signaled that the bank was ready to take [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action in
December as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers will be presented with the latest set of ECB
staff macroeconomic projections.

Policymakers' comments thereafter had also hinted at a possible
expansion of the pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP, and
more targeted lending to banks in the form of TLTROs.  
  
The resurgence in the coronavirus or Covid-19 pandemic has seen
countries like Germany and France return to partial lockdown. However,
the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of vaccine approval has kindled hopes of an economic revival
across the world.  
  
"All these steps are real central bank engineering, something ECB
President Christine Lagarde called 'reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)tion' at the October
meeting, but no actual stepping up of monetary stimulus," ING economist
Carsten Brzeski said.

"Instead, the ECB's main aim is to extend the current level of monetary
accommodation until mid-2022."

On Thursday, the bank left its three interest rates unchanged as
expected. The main refi rate was retained at a record low zero percent
and the deposit rate was kept at -0.50 percent. The lending rate was
left unchanged at 0.25 percent.  
  
The Governing Council retained its forward guidance on interest rates,
saying it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present
or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly
converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within
its projection horizon.

In other stimulus measures unveiled on Thursday, the ECB decided to
extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing
measures adopted by the Governing Council on April 7 and 22 this year.
These will be reviewed before June 2022, the bank said.

The Governing Council also decided to offer four additional pandemic
emergency longer-term refinancing operations, or PELTROs, in 2021, which
the ECB said will continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop.

The size of the monthly asset purchases under the asset purchase
programme (APP) was retained at EUR 20 billion. Rate-setters continue to
expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as
necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates, and
to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.

The ECB also extended the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks
(EUREP) and all temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro area central
banks until March 2022.

The regular lending operations will continue as fixed rate tender
procedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long
as necessary, the bank said.
