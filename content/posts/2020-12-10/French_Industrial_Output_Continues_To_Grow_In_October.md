French industrial production continued to expand in October, data from
the statistical office Insee showed Thursday.

Industrial output climbed 1.6 percent month-on-month, the same rate of
increase as seen in September. This was the sixth consecutive rise in
production and faster than the economists' forecast of 0.4 percent.  
  
At the same time, manufacturing output growth eased to 0.5 percent from
2.3 percent a month ago.

Compared to February, the last month before the beginning of the first
general lockdown, industrial output was down by 3.6 percent and
manufacturing by 5.0 percent.

In October, output bounced back in mining and quarrying, energy, water
supply by 7.9 percent. Construction output grew 1.7 percent, reversing
an 8.3 percent fall in the previous month.
