First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits showed a significant
increase in the week ended December 5th, according to a report released
by the Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims jumped to 853,000, an increase of
137,000 from the previous week's revised level of 716,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 725,000 from the
712,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the much bigger than expected increase, jobless claims reached
their highest level since hitting 873,000 in the week ended September
19th.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also climbed to 776,000, an increase of 35,500 from the previous week's
revised average of 740,500.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also surged up by 230,000 to 5.757 million in
the week ended November 28th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims fell to 5,935,750, a
decrease of 260,250 from the previous week's revised average of
6,196,000.

"The Thanksgiving holiday may still be wreaking some havoc with the
data, but the underlying picture is still one of weak labor market
conditions as the [coronavirus][1] surges," said Nancy Vanden Houten,
Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

A closely watched report released by the Labor Department last Friday
showed U.S. job growth slowed by much more than anticipated in the month
of November.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 245,000
jobs in November after jumping by a downwardly revised 610,000 jobs in
October.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 469,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 638,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

Despite the weaker than expected job growth, the unemployment rate
dipped to 6.7 percent in November from 6.9 percent in October. The
unemployment rate was expected to edge down to 6.8 percent.
