The UK [economy][1] expanded for the sixth straight month in October but
the pace of growth weakened as restrictions to contain the Covid-19
spread weighed on the hospitality sector, data from the Office for
National Statistics showed Thursday.

Gross domestic product climbed 0.4 percent month-on-month, as expected,
but slower than the 1.1 percent growth seen in September. This was the
sixth consecutive monthly growth.

October GDP was 23.4 percent higher than its April 2020 low. However, it
remained 7.9 percent below the levels seen in February 2020, before the
full impact of the [coronavirus][2] pandemic.

Ongoing tight 'tiered' restrictions mean the economy is unlikely to
regain all of November's lost output through December, and GDP is likely
to end the year some 9-10 percent below pre-virus levels, James Smith,
an ING economist said.

While a positive GDP figure remains the most likely outcome, the rising
risk of another form of lockdown in the new year, combined with the
initial disruption as UK-EU trade [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) change (even with a deal),
suggest the UK economy is far from out of the woods just yet - even as
vaccine optimism raises hopes for a better performance through the
latter parts of 2021, the economist added.

The production-side breakdown showed that slowdown in October was
largely caused by the services activity. Services growth eased to 0.2
percent from 1 percent a month ago.

Construction output climbed 1 percent after rising 2.9 percent in the
previous month. Meanwhile, growth in industrial output improved to 1.3
percent from 0.5 percent as manufacturing expanded 1.7 percent,
following September's 0.2 percent gain.

In October, GDP was down 8.2 percent annually, slower than the 8.4
percent fall registered in September.  
  
Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade gap rose to
its highest level since May 2019 falling exports. The trade deficit
widened to GBP 11.99 billion from GBP 9.34 billion in September.

Exports decreased 5.9 percent on month, while imports grew 2.8 percent
in October.

The total trade deficit posted the deficit for the first time in seven
months. The shortfall came in at GBP 1.74 billion versus a surplus of
GBP 613 million in September.
