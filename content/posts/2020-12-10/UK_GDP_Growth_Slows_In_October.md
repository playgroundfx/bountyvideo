The UK [economy][1] expanded for the sixth straight month in October but
the pace of growth moderated as expected, data from the Office for
National Statistics showed Thursday.

Gross domestic product climbed 0.4 percent month-on-month, slower than
the 1.1 percent growth seen in September. This was the sixth consecutive
monthly growth.

October GDP was 23.4 percent higher than its April 2020 low. However, it
remained 7.9 percent below the levels seen in February 2020, before the
full impact of the [coronavirus][2] pandemic.

The production-side breakdown showed that slowdown was largely caused by
the services activity. Services growth moderated to 0.2 percent in
October from 1 percent a month ago.

Meanwhile, growth in industrial output improved to 1.3 percent from 0.5
percent as manufacturing expanded 1.7 percent, following September's 0.2
percent gain.

Construction output climbed 1 percent after rising 2.9 percent in the
previous month.  
  
In October, GDP was down 8.2 percent annually, slower than the 8.4
percent fall registered in September.

Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade gap rose to
its highest level since May 2019. The trade deficit widened to GBP 11.99
billion in October from GBP 9.34 billion in September.  
  
The total trade deficit posted deficit for the first time in seven
months. The shortfall came in at GBP 1.74 billion versus a surplus of
GBP 613 million in September.
