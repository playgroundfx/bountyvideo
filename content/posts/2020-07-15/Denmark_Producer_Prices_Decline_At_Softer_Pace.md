Denmark's producer prices declined in June largely driven by falling
prices of mining and quarrying, figures from Statistics Denmark showed
on Wednesday.

The producer price index fell 1.6 percent year-on-year in June, slower
than the 5.6 percent decline in May.

The latest decline in the producer prices was largely due to a 25.5
percent decrease in mining and quarrying prices and a 17.7 percent fall
in energy supply cost, the agency said.

Domestic market prices declined 3.8 percent annually in May, while
foreign market prices rose 0.2 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 3.4 percent in May.

Import prices decreased 2.8 percent yearly in May but rose 0.4 percent
from a month ago.
