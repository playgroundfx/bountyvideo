The Bank of Japan maintained its massive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus on
Wednesday as the [economy][1] is expected to contract more sharply in
the current financial year due to the challenges posed by the novel
coronavirus.

The Policy Board of the BoJ voted 8-1 to retain the interest rate at
-0.1 percent on current accounts that financial institutions maintain at
the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The bank will actively buy exchange-traded funds and Japan real estate
investment trusts so that their outstanding amounts will increase at
annual paces with the upper limit of about JPY 12 trillion and JPY 180
billion, respectively.

As for CP and corporate bonds, the bank will maintain their outstanding
amounts at JPY 2 trillion and JPY 3 trillion, respectively.

The bank is unlikely to announce major new measures over the coming
months, Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The economy is forecast to improve gradually from the second half of the
year with economic activity resuming, but the pace is expected to be
only moderate while the impact of the novel [coronavirus][2] remains
worldwide, BoJ said.

The bank observed uncertainty posed by the covid-19 is extremely high.
It is highly unclear how the pandemic will evolve and how long it will
take to subside, the banks said.

According to the quarterly outlook report, the economy will contract 4.7
percent in this fiscal year ending March 2021. In April, the bank had
forecast a fall somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent.

Thereafter, the economy is projected to expand 3.3 percent in next
fiscal year and 1.5 percent in the fiscal 2022. Earlier, the bank had
forecast 2.8 percent to 3.9 percent growth in 2021 and 0.8 to 1.6
percent in FY 2022.

Consumer prices are expected to fall 0.5 percent in the fiscal 2020. In
April, prices were expected to drop between 0.3 and 0.7 percent.

The bank projected consumer prices to rise 0.3 percent in the next
fiscal and 0.7 percent in the fiscal 2022.
