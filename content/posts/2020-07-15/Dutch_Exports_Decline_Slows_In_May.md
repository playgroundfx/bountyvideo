Dutch exports and imports continued to fall in May as demand remains
impacted due to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, figures from the
statistical office CBS showed on Wednesday.

Merchandise exports fell 11.8 percent year-on-year in May, following a
13.8 percent decrease in April. Exports declined for the third
consecutive month.

In May, exports of transport and petroleum products decreased and
manufactured exports were greater than that of re-exports, the agency
said.

Imports decreased 7.6 percent annually in May, following a 9.0 percent
fall in the prior month. Imports fell for a fifth month in a row.

In May, imports of transport equipment, machinery and clothing decreased
from last year.

Conditions for exports in July are less favorable than in May, the CBS
said, mainly because the shrinkage of German industrial production was
greater.

Further, both Dutch and European industrial entrepreneurs assessed their
foreign order position more negatively. Meanwhile, the confidence of
German and European entrepreneurs was less negative.
