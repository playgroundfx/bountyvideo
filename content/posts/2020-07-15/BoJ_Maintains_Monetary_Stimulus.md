The Bank of Japan left its massive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus unchanged on
Wednesday and expects the [economy][1] to recover at a moderate pace
from the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Policy Board of the Bank of Japan voted 8-1 to retain the interest
rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that financial institutions
maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The economy is forecast to improve gradually from the second half of the
year with economic activity resuming, but the pace is expected to be
only moderate while the impact of the novel [coronavirus][2] remains
worldwide.

According to the quarterly outlook report, the economy will contract 4.7
percent this fiscal year, before expanding 3.3 percent in 2021 and 1.5
percent in 2022.

Consumer prices are forecast to fall 0.5 percent in the fiscal 2020. The
bank project prices to rise 0.3 percent next fiscal and 0.7 percent in
fiscal 2022.
