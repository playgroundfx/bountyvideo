With fuel prices continuing to skyrocket, the Labor Department released
a report on Wednesday showing U.S. import prices surged up by more than
expected in the month of June.

The report said import prices shot up by 1.4 percent in June after
climbing by a downwardly revised 0.8 percent in May.

Economists had expected import prices to jump by 1.0 percent, matching
the increase originally reported for the previous month.

Fuel import prices led the way higher once again, soaring by 21.9
percent in June after spiking by 15.4 percent in May.

Higher prices for both petroleum and natural gas contributed to the
jump, which reflected the biggest increase since the index was first
published monthly in September 1992.

Excluding fuel prices, import prices rose by a much more modest 0.3
percent in June after inching up by 0.1 percent in May.

The uptick came as higher prices for non-fuel industrial supplies and
materials, capital goods, and consumer goods more than offset lower
prices for foods, feeds, and beverages and automotive vehicles.

The Labor Department said export prices also surged up by 1.4 percent in
June after rising by a downwardly revised 0.4 percent in May.

Export prices were expected to climb by 0.8 percent compared to the 0.5
percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The bigger than expected increase in export prices came as prices for
agricultural exports and non-agricultural exports both jumped by 1.4
percent.

Agricultural export prices rose for the first time since January,
reflecting higher prices for dairy products, vegetables, corn, and
soybeans.

The increase in prices for non-agricultural exports was led by higher
prices for non-agricultural industrial supplies and materials, which
more than offset declining prices for capital goods and non-agricultural
foods.

Despite the monthly increase, import prices in June were down by 3.8
percent compared to the same month a year ago, as fuel prices plunged by
36.4 percent.

Export prices were down by 4.4 percent year-over-year, as prices for
agricultural exports and non-agricultural exports tumbled by 4.5 percent
and 4.4 percent, respectively.
