India's merchandise trade balance swung to a surplus in June, the first
in the last decade, as imports plummeted amid weak demand and supply
disruptions due to the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic, data
from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry showed on Wednesday.

The trade balance showed a surplus of $0.79 billion for June versus a
deficit of $15.28 billion in the same month last year. Economists had
forecast a shortfall of $4.50 billion.

This is the first time in the last decade that India is a net exporter,
the ministry said.

Imports slumped 47.59 percent year-on-year and exports dropped 12.41
percent.

Gold imports plunged 77.42 percent and imports of coal and crude oil &
petroleum decreased over 55 percent each. Imports of machinery,
electrical and non-electrical goods and those of electronic goods fell
by 42.02 percent and 34.05 percent, respectively.

In the April to June quarter, the visible trade deficit narrowed to
$9.12 billion from $45.96 billion in the same period last year. Imports
shrunk 52.43 percent and exports dropped 36.71 percent.

The services trade logged a surplus of $6.83 billion in May, data from
the central bank showed Wednesday. Export receipts decreased 10.24
percent year-on-year and import payments fell 20.45 percent.

The overall trade surplus for April-June 2020-21 is estimated at $11.70
billion as compared to the deficit of $26.32 billion in in the same
period of the previous financial year.
