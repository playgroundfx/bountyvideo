UK consumer price inflation increased unexpectedly in June driven by
games and clothing cost, data from the Office for National Statistics
showed Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 0.6 percent from a four-year low of 0.5
percent in May. The rate was expected to slow to 0.4 percent.
Nonetheless, inflation continues to remain well below the central bank's
2 percent target.

Confounding expectations for a decline of 0.2 percent, consumer prices
gained 0.1 percent on a monthly basis after remaining unchanged in May.

Meanwhile, excluding energy, food, alcoholic beverages and tobacco, core
inflation advanced to 1.4 percent from 1.2 percent in May. The rate was
forecast to remain unchanged at 1.2 percent.

Prices for games and clothing provided upward contributions to
inflation, while food prices eased in June.

Bank of England Silvana Tenreyro said disinflationary pressures are set
to remain for some time. Headline inflation will continue to weaken in
the near-term, given a continuing sizeable impact from lower energy
prices, and a negative contribution from the recent cut in VAT.

Although these effects on headline inflation should prove temporary,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) needs to continue to support aggregate demand through the crisis,
she noted.

The small rise inflation probably will not be sustained for long as the
effects of the Chancellor's VAT cut for the hospitality/tourism sectors
and the "Eat Out to Help Out" restaurant discount scheme will probably
drag inflation just below zero in the coming months, Paul Dales, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

ONS Deputy National Statistician for Economic Statistics Jonathan Athow
said, due to the pandemic, clothing prices have not followed the usual
seasonal pattern this year, with the normal falls due to the start of
the summer sales failing to materialize.  
  
Another report from ONS showed that output prices dropped 0.8 percent on
a yearly basis, slower than the 1.2 percent decrease in May and the
expected drop of 1.1 percent. This was the third consecutive month that
the rate has been negative.

Month-on-month, output prices advanced 0.3 percent, reversing a 0.2
percent drop in May. Economists had forecast a monthly growth of 0.2
percent. This was the first time the monthly rate has been positive
since January 2020 and the highest since July 2019.

Input prices fell by 6.4 percent on year in June compared to a 9.4
percent drop in May. This was the fifth consecutive fall in prices.
Economists had forecast a 6.5 percent fall.

On a monthly basis, input prices were up 2.4 percent in June, faster
than the 0.9 percent rise logged in May but slower than the 3 percent
rise economists' had forecast.
