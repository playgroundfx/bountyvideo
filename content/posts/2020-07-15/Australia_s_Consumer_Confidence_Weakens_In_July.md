Australia's consumer sentiment deteriorated in July due to the
resurgence in [coronavirus][1] cases, survey data from Westpac showed
Wednesday.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment fell 6.1
percent to 87.9 in July from 93.7 in June.

The current drop in confidence reversed all of last month's impressive
gain, taking the index back to the weak levels seen in May.

Among sub-components, the '[economy][2], next 12mths' sub-index recorded
the biggest decline, slumping 14 percent in July. Similarly, the
'economy, next 5yrs' sub-index logged a sharp 10.3 percent fall.

The index for family finances over next 12 months slid 6.7 percent
consistent with the more difficult path ahead.

However, the family finances versus a year ago sub-index ticked up
slightly, rising 2.5 percent. This reflects significant 'reopening
boosts' in other states and government income support packages.

Further, the pull back in buyer sentiment was also mild, the 'time to
buy a major item' sub-index dipped just 2.1 percent from previous month.

The Westpac Melbourne Institute Unemployment Expectations Index surged
12.1 percent from June.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's Board next meets on August 4. The bank
will maintain its current highly stimulatory stance and continue to
commit to steady [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for the foreseeable future, Bill Evans, chief
economist at Westpac, said.
