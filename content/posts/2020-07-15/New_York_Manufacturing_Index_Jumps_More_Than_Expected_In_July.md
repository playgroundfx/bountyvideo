Following four consecutive months of contraction, the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York released a report on Wednesday showing New York
manufacturing activity expanded in the month of July.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions soared to a
positive 17.2 in July from a negative 0.2 in June, with a positive
reading indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists
had expected the index to jump to 10.0.

Meanwhile, the report said firms remained optimistic about the six-month
outlook, though less so than in the previous month.
