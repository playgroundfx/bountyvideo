While U.S. economic activity increased in almost all Federal Reserve
districts in recent weeks, the central bank's Beige Book noted activity
remained well below where it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in the twelve Fed districts, indicated the recent increase in
economic activity came as consumer spending picked up as many non-
essential businesses were allowed to reopen.

Retail sales rose in all Fed districts, with a rebound in vehicle sales
leading the way along with sustained growth in the food and beverage and
home improvement sectors.

The Fed said leisure and hospitality spending also improved in recent
weeks but remained far below year-ago levels.

Most districts reported that manufacturing activity improved from a very
low level, while demand for professional and [business][1] services also
increased in most districts but was still weak.

The Beige Book also said employment increased in almost all districts as
many businesses reopened or ramped up activity, with districts
highlighting gains in the retail and leisure and hospitality sectors.

However, the report said payrolls were well below pre-pandemic levels
and job turnover rates remained high, as [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s across districts
reported new layoffs.

Prices were little changed overall, the Fed said regarding inflation,
with [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s across districts largely reporting both input and selling
prices were flat.

Looking ahead, the Fed said outlooks remained highly uncertain, as
[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s grappled with how long the COVID-19 pandemic would continue and
the magnitude of its economic implications.

The release of the Beige Book comes two weeks ahead of the Fed's next
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting scheduled for July 28-29.
