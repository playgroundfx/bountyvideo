Spain's consumer price inflation rose slightly less than estimated in
October but was the fastest since 1992, final data from the statistical
office INE showed on Friday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 5.4 percent in October from 4 percent
in September. The rate was marginally below the 5.5 percent estimated on
October 28.  
  
Nonetheless, inflation was the strongest since September 1992.

Inflation was largely driven by the 20.5 percent increase in housing and
12.3 percent rise in transportation costs.

Core inflation, which excludes prices of fresh food and energy products,
rose to 1.4 percent, as initially estimated, from 1 percent in
September.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices advanced 1.8 percent after rising
0.8 percent in the previous month. The monthly rate was revised down
from the flash estimate of 2 percent.

Year-on-year, EU harmonized inflation climbed to 5.4 percent from 4
percent a month ago. The INE revised down the annual rate from 5.5
percent.

The harmonized index of consumer prices gained 1.6 percent on month
versus the 1.1 rise in September and the flash 1.7 percent.
