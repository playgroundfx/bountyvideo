Switzerland's producer and import prices continued to decline in
September, data from the Federal Statistical Office showed on Thursday.

Producer and import prices fell 3.1 percent year-on-year in September.

The producer price index fell 1.9 percent annually in September and
import prices decreased 5.6 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer and import prices rose 0.1 percent in
September.

The latest increase was mainly due to rise in prices for iron scraps,
and metals and semi-finished metal products, the agency said.

Domestic sale prices fell 0.7 percent yearly in September and remained
unchanged from a month ago.
