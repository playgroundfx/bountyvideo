A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed a significant acceleration in the pace of growth in
regional manufacturing activity in the month of October.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity jumped to
32.3 in October from 15.0 in September, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing. Economists had expected the
index to edge down to 14.0.

With the much bigger than expected increase, the Philly Fed Index spiked
to its highest level since before the [coronavirus][1]\- lockdowns.

The sharp increase by the headline index came as the new orders index
soared to 42.6 in October from 25.5 in September and the shipments index
surged up to 46.5 from 36.6.

On the other hand, the report said the number of employees index dipped
to 12.7 in October from 15.7 in September, indicating a modest slowdown
in the pace of job growth.

The prices paid index rose to 28.5 in October from 25.1 in September,
while the prices received index fell to 14.0 from 18.4 in the previous
month.

"Manufacturing has rebounded strongly since the peak damage phase of the
crisis, but its recovery will slow as the [health][2] crisis drags on,"
said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Consumer and [business][3] demand for goods will soften as
economic momentum weakens and lawmakers are unlikely to provide
meaningful fiscal support."

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said most future indexes increased and
continue to reflect optimism among firms about growth over the next six
months.

The diffusion index for future general activity climbed to 62.7 in
October from 56.6 in September, reaching its highest reading since June.
