French consumer prices remained flat in September, final data from the
statistical office Insee showed on Thursday.

Consumer prices remained unchanged on a yearly basis in September, after
rising 0.2 percent in August. The annual rate was revised down from +0.1
percent.

At the same time, core inflation held steady at 0.5 percent in
September.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.5 percent, which was faster
than the 0.1 percent drop seen in August but in line with the initial
estimate.

Services prices declined sharply by 1.5 percent on month and prices of
energy were down 0.7 percent. Food prices decreased 0.5 percent, while
manufactured product prices rebounded 1.6 percent.

The harmonized index of consumer prices dropped at a faster rate of 0.6
percent month-on-month, following a 0.1 percent decrease in the previous
month.

Year-on-year, the HICP was stable after the 0.2 percent increase in
August. The month-on-month and year-on-year changes in the HICP have
been confirmed.
