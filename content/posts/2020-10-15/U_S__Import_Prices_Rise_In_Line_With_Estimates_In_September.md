A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed import
prices in the U.S. increased in line with economist estimates in the
month of September.

The Labor Department said import prices rose by 0.3 percent in September
after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.0 percent in August.

Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.3 percent compared to
the 0.9 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The report also said export prices climbed by 0.6 percent following the
0.5 percent advance seen in August. Export prices were expected to
increase by 0.4 percent.
