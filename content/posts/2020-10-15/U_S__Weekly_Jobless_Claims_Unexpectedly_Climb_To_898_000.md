First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased
in the week ended October 10th, according to a report released by the
Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims climbed to 898,000, an increase
of 53,000 from the previous week's revised level of 845,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 825,000 from the
840,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the unexpected increase, jobless claims reached their highest level
since topping 1 million in the week ended August 22nd.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also inched up to 866,250, an increase of 8,000 from the previous week's
revised average of 858,250.

Meanwhile, the report said continuing claims, a reading on the number of
people receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, tumbled by 1.165
million to 10.018 million in the week ended October 3rd.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also slumped to
11,481,750, a decrease of 682,250 from the previous week's revised
average of 12,164,000.

Despite the continued decline in continuing claims, Nancy Vanden Houten,
Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics noted that "positive trend
continues to be partly offset by a rise in the number of individuals who
have exhausted regular benefits."

"Failure to pass additional fiscal relief measures poses considerable
downside risk to the [economy][1], particularly as Covid-19 cases are on
the rise and would likely lead to further job losses," Vanden Houten
said.

She added, "Failure to provide more relief raises the risk that some
individuals will lose benefits altogether at the start of 2021."
