A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed import
prices in the U.S. increased in line with economist estimates in the
month of September.

The Labor Department said import prices rose by 0.3 percent in September
after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.0 percent in August.

Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.3 percent compared to
the 0.9 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The uptick in import prices came despite a sharp pullback in prices for
fuel imports, which tumbled by 2.9 percent in September after surging up
by 3.9 percent in August.

Prices for non-fuel imports advanced by 0.6 percent in September after
climbing by 0.7 percent in August, with the continued increase primarily
driven by higher prices for non-fuel industrial supplies and materials.

The report also said export prices climbed by 0.6 percent following the
0.5 percent advance seen in August. Export prices were expected to
increase by 0.4 percent.

The stronger than expected export price growth came as prices for
agricultural exports jumped by 2.7 percent in September after slumping
by 2.3 percent in August.

Higher prices for soybeans, corn, fruit, cotton, wheat, nuts, and meat
more than offset lower prices for dairy products and egg, leading to the
biggest increase in prices for agricultural exports since December 2018.

Prices for non-agricultural exports also rose by 0.3 percent in
September after climbing by 0.8 percent in the previous month.

Despite another monthly increase, import prices in September were down
by 1.1 percent compared to the same month a year ago. Export prices were
down by 1.8 percent year-over-year.
