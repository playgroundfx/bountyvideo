Growth in New York manufacturing activity slowed by more than expected
in the month of October, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York revealed
in a report on Thursday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index slid to
10.5 in October from 17.0 in September.

While a positive reading still indicates growth in regional
manufacturing activity, economists had expected the index to show a much
more modest drop to 15.0.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic
conditions would improve over the next six months, although optimism was
somewhat lower than last month.
