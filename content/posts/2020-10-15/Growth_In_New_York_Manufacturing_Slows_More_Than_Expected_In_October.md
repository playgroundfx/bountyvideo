Growth in New York manufacturing activity slowed by more than expected
in the month of October, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York revealed
in a report on Thursday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index slid to
10.5 in October from 17.0 in September.

While a positive reading still indicates growth in regional
manufacturing activity, economists had expected the index to show a much
more modest drop to 15.0.

The bigger than expected decrease by the headline index came even though
the new orders index climbed to 12.3 in October from 7.1 in September
and the shipments index rose to 17.8 from 14.1.

The number of employees index also increased to 7.2 in October from 2.6
in September, indicating an acceleration in the pace of job growth.

The report also said the prices paid index crept up to 27.8 in October
from 25.2 in September, while the prices edged down to 5.3 from 6.5.

"The October Empire State Manufacturing Survey signals continued, albeit
softer, expansion supported by rising shipments and a gain in new
orders, although employers are still hiring cautiously," said Oren
Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic
conditions would improve over the next six months, although optimism was
somewhat lower than last month.

The index for future business conditions fell to 32.8 in October from
40.3 in September.
