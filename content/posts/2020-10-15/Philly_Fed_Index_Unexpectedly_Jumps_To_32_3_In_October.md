A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed a significant acceleration in the pace of growth in
regional manufacturing activity in the month of October.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity jumped to
32.3 in October from 15.0 in September, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing. Economists had expected the
index to edge down to 14.0.

Looking ahead, most future indexes increased and continue to reflect
optimism among firms about growth over the next six months.
