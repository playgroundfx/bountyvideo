the previous quarter.

On the expenditure side, private consumption was up by 3.5 percent, as
expenditures on semi-durable goods (e.g. clothing) and services (e.g.
recreation & culture, restaurants & accommodation services) increased.

Government consumption rose by 3.9 percent, with increased expenditures
on [health][1] care benefits.

Construction investment contracted by 2.5 percent, as building
construction and civil engineering both decreased. Facilities investment
grew by 0.6 percent, driven by an increase in transportation equipment.

Exports fell by 2.0 percent, due to decreases in motor vehicles and
LCDs. Imports were up by 2.8 percent, owing to increased imports of
basic metals and chemical products.

On the production side, agriculture, forestry & fishing decreased by
13.6 percent, as crop yields declined.

Manufacturing fell by 1.2 percent, due to a decrease in transportation
equipment. Electricity, gas & water supply declined by 3.5 percent, due
to a decrease in electricity.

On an annualized basis, GDP was up 5.9 percent - just shy or forecasts
for an increase of 6.0 percent but up from 1.9 percent in the three
months prior.
