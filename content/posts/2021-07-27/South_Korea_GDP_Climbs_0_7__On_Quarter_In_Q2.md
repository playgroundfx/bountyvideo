South Korea's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.7
percent on quarter in the second quarter of 2021, the Bank of Korea said
in Tuesday's advance estimate.

That was in line with expectations following the 1.7 percent growth in
the previous three months.

On an annualized basis, GDP was up 5.9 percent - just shy or forecasts
for an increase of 6.0 percent but up from 1.9 percent in the three
months prior.

Real gross domestic income (GDI) decreased by 0.6 percent compared to
the previous quarter.
