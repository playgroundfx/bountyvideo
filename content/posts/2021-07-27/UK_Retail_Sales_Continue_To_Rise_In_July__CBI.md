UK retail sales continued to expand in July, while orders grew the most
since December 2010, the latest Distributive Trades Survey data from the
Confederation of British Industry showed on Tuesday.

The retail sales balance came in at 23 percent in July, but slightly
down from 25 percent in June. The balance was expected to fall to 21
percent.

Meanwhile, the order book balance advanced to 49 percent, the highest
since December 2010, from 30 percent in June.

A net balance of 29 percent of retailers expect sales to increase and a
net 39 percent forecast orders to grow in August.

The survey showed that the internet sales were almost flat in July. With
growth slowing for the fifth consecutive month, the balance of +2
percent in July was the weakest since the question was first asked in
August 2009.

Retailers expect internet sales to pick up next month, but growth was
expected to remain well below the long run average.

While demand may be more stable, operational issues worsen, Ben Jones,
principal economist at the CBI, said.

"Relative stock levels are at a record low and expected to fall further
still, while the number one worry for many firms at the minute is labor
shortages throughout the supply chain as staff self-isolate," Jones
added.
