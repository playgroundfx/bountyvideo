The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised the global growth
forecast for next year and the growth is projected to be driven largely
by the expansion in the advanced economies, while their emerging and
developing peers are set to have modest gains.  
  
The global growth forecast for 2022 was raised to 4.9 percent from 4.4
percent, the IMF said in an update to its World Economic Forecast.

"The 0.5 percentage-point upgrade for 2022 derives largely from the
forecast upgrade for advanced economies, particularly the United States,
reflecting the anticipated legislation of additional fiscal support in
the second half of 2021 and improved [health][1] metrics more broadly
across the group," the IMF said.  
  
The growth projection for this year was retained at 6.0 percent.

"The recovery is not assured until the pandemic is beaten back
globally," IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said.  
  
The global lender forecast inflation to return to its pre-Covid levels
in most countries next year, once the impact of the unusual developments
related to the pandemic and transitory supply-demand mismatches work
their way through prices.  
  
High food prices may lead to elevated inflation in some emerging market
and developing economies, the report said.  
  
The IMF urged central banks to generally look through transitory
inflation pressures and avoid tightening until there is more clarity on
underlying price dynamics.  
  
The lender also stressed that clear communication from central banks on
the outlook for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be key to shaping inflation
expectations and safeguarding against premature tightening of financial
conditions.  
  
"There is, however, a risk that transitory pressures could become more
persistent and central banks may need to take preemptive action," the
IMF said.
