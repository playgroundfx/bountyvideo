While a report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed new
orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods saw continued growth in the
month of June, the increase came in well below expectations.

The report said durable goods orders climbed by 0.8 percent in June
after spiking by an upwardly revised 3.2 percent in May.

Economists had been expecting orders to surge up by 2.1 percent compared
to the 2.3 percent jump that had been reported for the previous month.

Excluding orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose
by 0.3 percent in June following a 0.5 percent increase in May. Ex-
transportation orders were expected to climb by 0.8 percent.
