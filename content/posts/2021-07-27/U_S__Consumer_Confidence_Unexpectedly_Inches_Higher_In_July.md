Consumer confidence in the U.S. saw a slight improvement from an
upwardly revised level in the month of July, according to a report
released by the Conference Board on Tuesday.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index inched up to
129.1 in July from an upwardly revised 128.9 in June. Economists had
expected the index to drop to 124.9 from the 127.3 originally reported
for the previous month.

With the unexpected uptick, the consumer confidence index reached its
highest level since hitting 132.6 in February of 2020.

"Spending intentions picked up in July, with a larger percentage of
consumers saying they planned to purchase homes, automobiles, and major
appliances in the coming months," said Lynn Franco, Senior Director of
Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.

She added, "Thus, consumer spending should continue to support robust
economic growth in the second half of 2021."

The modest increase by the headline index came as the present situation
index crept up to 160.3 in July from 159.6 in June.

Consumers' appraisal of current [business][1] conditions improved
slightly, while their assessment of the labor market was relatively
flat.

Meanwhile, the report showed the expectations index came in at 108.4 in
July, virtually unchanged from 108.5 in the previous month.

While consumers' optimism about the short-term business conditions
outlook eased slightly, they remained upbeat about their short-term
financial prospects.

On Friday, the University of Michigan is scheduled to release its
revised reading on consumer sentiment in the month of July.

The consumer sentiment index for July is expected to be unrevised from
the preliminary reading of 80.8, which was down from 85.5 in June.
