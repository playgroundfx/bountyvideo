The National Association of Home Builders released a report on Wednesday
showing a bigger than expected decrease in U.S. homebuilder confidence
in the month of March.

The report showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to
79 in March from a downwardly revised 81 in February. Economists had
expected the index to edge down to 81 from the 82 originally reported
for the previous month.

The NAHB noted the index dropped below 80 for the first time since last
September as increasing development and construction costs have taken a
toll on builder confidence even as buyer demand remains relatively
solid.

The bigger than expected decrease by the index came as the gauge
measuring sales expectations in the next six months plunged to 70 in
March from 80 in February.

The index gauging current sales conditions also fell to 86 in March from
89 in February, while the component charting traffic of prospective
buyers rose to 67 from 65.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of February.

Housing starts are expected to jump by 3.2 percent to an annual rate of
1.690 million, while building permits are expected to slump by 2.4
percent to a rate of 1.850 million.
