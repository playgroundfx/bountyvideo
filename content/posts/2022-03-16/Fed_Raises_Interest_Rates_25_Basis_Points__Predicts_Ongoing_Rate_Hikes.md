In an effort to combat inflation at 40-year highs, the Federal Reserve
on Wednesday announced its widely expected decision to raise interest
rates for the first time since December of 2018.

The Fed said it has decided to raise the target range for the federal
funds rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 to 0.5 percent.

The central bank also predicted ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate,
with the Fed's latest projections pointing to an interest rate of 1.9
percent by the end of the year.

Additionally, the Fed said it expects to begin reducing its holdings of
Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed
securities at a coming meeting.

"With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the
labor market to remain strong," the Fed said.

The decision to raise rates by 25 basis points was nearly unanimous,
although St. Louis Fed President James Bullard preferred a 50 basis
point increase.

The rate hike came even as the Fed acknowledged Russia's invasion of
Ukraine is "causing tremendous human and economic hardship."

The Fed said the economic implications of the conflict are "highly
uncertain" but predicted the invasion and related events would create
additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.

Potentially reflecting the impact of the invasion, Fed officials lowered
their projections for GDP growth in 2022 to 2.8 percent from 4.0 percent
and raised their projections for consumer price growth to 4.3 percent
from 2.6 percent.

The Fed reiterated it would continue to monitor the implications of
incoming information for the economic outlook when assessing the
appropriate stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

The central bank said it would be prepared to adjust the stance of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the
attainment of the Fed's goals of price stability and maximum employment.
