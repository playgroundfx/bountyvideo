Australia's leading index rose in February but remained in negative
zone, data from Westpac showed on Wednesday.

The six-month annualized growth rate in the Westpac-Melbourne Institute
Leading Index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity
relative to trend three to nine months into the future, rose to -0.25
percent in February from -0.5 percent in January.

While the growth rate lifted in February, the latest read remained in
negative territory but only slightly below trend. Westpac expects strong
trend growth in 2022.

After digesting a substantial lift in inflation in the March quarter on
April 27 and further progress on wages growth which will be announced on
May 18, Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac said he expects the Board
to move to a tightening bias over June and July prior to raising the
cash rate by 0.15 percent on August 2.
