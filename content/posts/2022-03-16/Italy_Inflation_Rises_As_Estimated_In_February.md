Italy's consumer price inflation accelerated in February to the highest
in nearly three decades, final data from the statistical office Istat
showed on Wednesday.

Driven by higher energy prices, consumer price inflation rose to 5.7
percent in February, as estimated, from 4.8 percent in January. This was
the highest rate since 1996.

Excluding energy and fresh food, core inflation rose to 1.7 percent from
1.5 percent in the previous month.

Prices of goods climbed at a faster pace of 8.6 percent annually and
that of services logged a steady growth of 1.8 percent in February.
Energy prices grew 45.9 percent from the last year.

EU harmonized inflation advanced to 6.2 percent from 5.1 percent a month
ago. The statistical office confirmed the preliminary estimate.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.9 percent, slower than the
1.6 percent increase in January.

The harmonized index of consumer prices moved up 0.8 percent after
staying flat a month ago. The monthly rates for both CPI and the HICP
matched the flash estimate.
