Business inventories in the U.S. increased in line with economist
estimates in the month of January, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department on Wednesday.

The report showed [business][1] inventories jumped by 1.1 percent in
January after surging by an upwardly revised 2.4 percent in December.

Economists had expected business inventories to shoot up by 1.1 percent
compared to the 2.1 percent spike originally reported for the previous
month.

Retail inventories continued to lead the way higher, leaping by 2.0
percent in January after soaring by 4.7 percent in December.

The report showed wholesale and manufacturing inventories also increased
by 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said business sales spiked by 3.7
percent in January after falling by 0.5 percent in December.

Retail and wholesale sales skyrocketed by 5.7 percent and 4.0 percent,
respectively, while manufacturing sales jumped by 1.2 percent.

With sale surging by much more than inventories, the total business
inventories/sales ratio dropped to 1.25 in January from 1.29 in
December.
