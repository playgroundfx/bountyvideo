After reporting a substantial rebound in U.S. retail sales in the
previous month, the Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday
showing a modest increase in retail sales in the month of February.

The Commerce Department said retail sales rose by 0.3 percent in
February after soaring by an upwardly revised 4.9 percent in January.

Economists had expected retail sales to increase by 0.4 percent compared
to the 3.8 percent spike originally reported for the previous month.

"U.S. retail sales settled back into a modest pace in February following
some Omicron-induced volatility and acute seasonal adjustment noise at
the turn of the year," said Lydia Boussour, Lead U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

The uptick in retail sales was partly due to a 5.3 percent surge in
sales by gas stations, which largely reflected higher prices at the
pump.

Sales by bars and restaurants, sporting goods, hobby, musical
instrument, and book store, clothing and accessories stores and
miscellaneous store retailers also saw notable growth.

Meanwhile, the report showed sales by non-store retailers tumbled by 3.7
percent in February after skyrocketing by 20.6 percent in January. Sales
by [health][1] and personal care stores and furniture and home
furnishing stores also slumped.

Excluding a 0.8 percent increase in sales by motor vehicle and parts
dealers, retail sales edged up by 0.2 percent in February after surging
by 4.4 percent in January. Ex-auto sales were expected to advance by 0.9
percent.

The report showed core retail sales, which exclude automobiles,
gasoline, building materials and food services, tumbled by 1.2 percent
in February after spiking by an upwardly revised 6.7 percent in January.

"The current surge in non-discretionary inflation - particularly food,
energy, and shelter - will pressure households' budgets and lead them to
pare back their discretionary purchases, while supply-chain issues will
continue to constrain sales growth," said Boussour.

She added, "But robust labor income growth, record levels of household
wealth and ample excess savings worth 13% of GDP mean that consumer
spending should remain supported in the months ahead."
