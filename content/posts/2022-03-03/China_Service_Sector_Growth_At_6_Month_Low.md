China's service sector grew at the slowest pace in six months in
February due to a renewed fall in overall new [business][1] amid ongoing
pandemic and measures to control the virus, survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Thursday.

The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 50.2 in February
from 51.4 in January.

The score signaled only a marginal growth in services activity. Notably,
the expansion was the softest seen since the current period of growth
began last September.

Client demand dropped for the first time in six months due to the
measures taken to contain the pandemic. Capacity pressures moderated in
February, as highlighted by a softer increase in outstanding workloads.

Service sector employment fell for the second month running in February.
However, the rate of job shedding eased since January.

On the price front, the input price inflation rose at the softest pace
since August 2021. Likewise, prices charged for services also logged a
slower growth.

Although firms saw a further slowdown in growth momentum during
February, optimism around the 12-month outlook for output improved to a
three-month high.

The composite output index that measures the performances of
manufacturing and services, came in at 50.1 in February, unchanged from
January and signaled only a fractional growth in overall business
activity.

Epidemic control measures were strengthened, which restricted
transportation and sales, Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight
Group said.

Under the "triple pressure" of demand contraction, supply shocks and
weakening expectations, the [economy][2]'s recovery is still not robust.
Stabilizing economic growth remains an important focus of the
government, Zhe added.
