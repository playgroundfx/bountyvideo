Private sector [business][1] in Hong Kong continued to contract in
February, and at a faster rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics
showed on Thursday with a PMI score of 42.9.

That's down from 58.9 in January, and it moves further beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This marks the second straight month in which the Hong Kong SAR private
sector shrank and at the fastest pace since April 2020. New orders and
output both eased for a second straight month and at faster paces in
February amid the persistent disruptions from the COVID-19 Omicron
outbreak.

Foreign demand, including demand from China, was also affected, falling
at sharper rates in February. As a result, Hong Kong SAR private sector
firms lowered their staffing levels in February. Buying activity
likewise fell, leading to lower stocks of purchases.
