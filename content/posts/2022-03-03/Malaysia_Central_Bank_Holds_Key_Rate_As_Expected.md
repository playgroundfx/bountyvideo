Malaysia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged, as widely
expected, on Thursday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to
maintain the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 1.75 percent.  
  
The MPC assessed the current stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as appropriate
and accommodative.

Headline inflation in 2022 is projected to remain moderate as the base
effect from fuel inflation continues to dissipate. The bank expects core
inflation to be modest, with the upside risk partly contained by the
continued slack in the [economy][1] and labor market.

The domestic growth recovery will strengthen this year, driven by the
expansion in global demand and higher private sector expenditure, amid
improvements in the labor market and continued targeted [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support,
the bank said.

BNM is likely to want to keep rates low to support the recovery, Alex
Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The upshot is that interest rates will remain on hold throughout 2022,
the economist added. In contrast, financial [markets][2] are pricing in
at least two 25 basis point rate hikes.
