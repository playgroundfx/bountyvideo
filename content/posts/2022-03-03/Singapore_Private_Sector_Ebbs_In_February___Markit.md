Private sector [business][1] in Singapore continued to expand in
February, albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from Markit
Economics showed on Thursday with a PMI score of 52.5.

That's down from 54.4 in January, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The rate of expansion eased to a three-month low but remained above the
series average. Higher demand supported output growth in February.

Anecdotal evidence suggested that increased overseas travel and orders
for COVID-19 related goods and services contributed to the rise in new
business. The rate of growth slowed, however, with some firms
experiencing heightened COVID-19 related disruptions. Growth of new
business from abroad likewise slowed. Survey respondents commented that
capacity and supply constraints limited their fulfilment of foreign
demand.
