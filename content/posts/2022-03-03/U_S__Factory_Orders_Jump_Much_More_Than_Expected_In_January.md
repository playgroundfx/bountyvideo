Partly reflecting a spike in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing new orders for
U.S. manufactured goods jumped much more than expected in the month of
January.

The report showed factory orders surged up by 1.4 percent in January
following a revised 0.7 percent increase in December.

Economists had expected factory orders to climb by 0.7 percent compared
to the 0.4 percent drop originally reported for the previous month.

The bigger than expected jump in factory orders came as orders for
durable goods shot up by 1.6 percent, unchanged from the previously
reported figure. Orders for transportation equipment led the way higher,
soaring by 3.4 percent.

The report showed orders for non-durable goods also jumped by 1.2
percent in January after inching up by 0.1 percent in December.

The Commerce Department also said shipments of manufactured goods surged
up by 1.2 percent in January following a 0.7 percent increase in
December.

Inventories of manufactured goods also climbed 0.7 percent in January
after rising by 0.4 percent in the previous month.

With shipments jumping by more than inventories, the inventories-to-
shipments ratio edged down to 1.45 in January from 1.46 in December.
