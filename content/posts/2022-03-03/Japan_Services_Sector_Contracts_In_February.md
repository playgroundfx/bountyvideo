The services sector in Japan continued to contract in February, and at
an accelerate rate, the latest survey from Jibun Bank showed on Thursday
with a services PMI score of 44.2.

That's down from 47.6 in January, and it moves further beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The decline in new [business][1] quickened from January to reach the
sharpest for six months. New orders fell for the second successive month
amid weaker client confidence and renewed restrictions on the services
sector. The reduction in demand was broad-based across domestic and
international markets, with foreign demand for services reducing at the
quickest pace since last August.

Japanese service providers registered a reduction in prices charged in
the latest survey period, the first for six months. The reduction was
often attributed to price discounting by service providers in an attempt
to stimulate demand.

The survey also showed that the composite index fell to 45.8 in February
from 49.9 in January.

Japanese service providers saw activity fall at the fastest pace in six
months, while manufacturers recorded a decline in output for the first
time since last September. Aggregate new orders saw a renewed
contraction in February.

Demand for manufactured goods rose at the softest pace for five months,
while service sector firms commented on the sharpest decline since last
August. In line with this trend, outstanding business was depleted at a
faster rate in February.
