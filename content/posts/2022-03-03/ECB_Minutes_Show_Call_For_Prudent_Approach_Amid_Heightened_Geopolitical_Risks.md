European Central Bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers saw the need for a cautious approach
to normalization amid rising geopolitical risks and chose to wait for
the macroeconomic projections in March to make a better assessment of
the outlook for euro area, minutes of the latest rate-setting session
showed Thursday.  
  
"Geopolitical tensions had increased, and a prolonged phase of high
energy costs constituted a material downside risk to consumer spending
and investment, while also increasing cost pressures in energy-intensive
sectors and elevating the risk of second-round inflation effects through
higher nominal wage settlements," the minutes, which the ECB calls the
'account', of the February 2-3 Governing Council session showed.  
  
Less than a month from February's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-making session, the
geopolitical situation, especially in Europe, worsened dramatically with
the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.  
  
During the February session, ECB warned that inflation could be higher
than anticipated over the next few months if the surge in energy prices
intensified, especially if geopolitical tensions were to escalate
further.  
  
Persistent sluggishness in oil supply and further extension of the
bottlenecks in production and international commerce would also keep
inflation higher.

Eurozone inflation accelerated further in February to hit a fresh record
high of 5.8 percent, driven by energy prices, data from Eurostat showed
earlier this week. Core inflation rose to 2.7 percent.  
  
Beyond the near term, inflation could be higher than foreseen if current
price pressures fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises, or
if the [economy][1] returned more quickly to full capacity than
considered likely at present, the ECB said.  
  
ECB rate-setters expected the growth outlook to improve significantly in
the latter part of this year.

ECB President Christine Lagarde's comments following the February
session had fueled expectations that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers were gearing up for an
interest rate hike later this year.  
  
The ECB Chief did not reiterate her earlier comment that an interest
rate hike is unlikely this year, instead she stressed that risks to
inflation are on the upside.  
  
Policymakers stressed on the critical need for a gradual and flexible
conduct of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the minutes showed.

"To this end, there was a need to maintain sufficient optionality with
respect to the time horizon for adjusting the Governing Council's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
instruments in a data-driven manner," the minutes said.

"In addition, heightened geopolitical risks were seen as calling for a
very prudent approach to normalization."
