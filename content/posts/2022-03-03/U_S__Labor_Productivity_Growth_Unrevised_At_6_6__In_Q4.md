A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed the spike
in U.S. labor productivity in the fourth quarter of 2021 was unrevised
from the initial estimate.

The Labor Department said labor productivity surged by 6.6 percent in
the fourth quarter after tumbling by 3.9 percent in the third quarter.
Economists had expected the jump in productivity to be upwardly revised
to 6.7 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed the increase in unit labor costs during the
quarter was upwardly revised to 0.9 percent from the previously reported
0.3 percent. Unit labor costs were expected to be unrevised.

The advance in unit labor costs during the fourth quarter came following
a 10.6 percent spike in the third quarter.
