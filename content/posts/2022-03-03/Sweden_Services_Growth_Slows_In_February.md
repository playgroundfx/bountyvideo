Sweden's services sector growth eased in February, survey data from
Swedbank and the logistics association Silf showed on Thursday.

The purchasing managers' index for the services sector fell to 68.0 in
February from 68.6 in January. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion
in the sector.

"However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly changed the
global picture of the world around us, which will have negative effects
on the Swedish service [economy][1] even if the direct exposure to
Russia and Ukraine is limited," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-indices, order intake, delivery time and [business][2]
volume declined in February, while employment increased to the highest
since 2018.

The index for suppliers' input goods prices decreased in February.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
65.3 in February from 66.8 in the previous month.
