Ireland's consumer confidence improved in August, as households were
increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, results of a survey
showed Friday.

The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index rose to 86.5 in August from 84.9
in July.

"The gains in the August survey largely reflected improved 'macro'
developments with little follow-through and this may suggest the
continued absence of any broadly based 'feel-good factor' in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
household finances," the KBC Bank said.

Among the six sub-indexes, two of the survey declined in August.
