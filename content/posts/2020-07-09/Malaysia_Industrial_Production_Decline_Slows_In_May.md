Malaysia's industrial production declined sharply, although at a softer
rate in May as many factories resumed operation after the
[coronavirus][1] related lockdown, data from the Department of
Statistics showed on Thursday.

Industrial production fell 22.1 percent year-on-year in May, following a
32.0 percent decrease in April. Economists had expected a 25.0 percent
decline.

Manufacturing output declined 23.2 percent in May, following a 37.2
percent fall in the previous month.

Among other sectors, mining and quarrying output decreased 22.2 percent
and electricity output fell 10.3 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production grew 18.2 percent in May, as
the government allowed more industries to operate during the month.
