The total value of core machine orders in Japan was up a seasonally
adjusted 1.7 percent on month, the Cabinet Office said on Thursday -
coming in at 765.0 billion yen.

That beat expectations for a drop of 5.4 percent following the 12.0
percent slide in April.

On a yearly basis, core machine orders dropped 16.3 percent - beating
expectations for a decline of 17.1 percent following the 17.7 percent
fall in the previous month.

For the second quarter of 2020, core machine orders are forecast to have
fallen 0.9 percent on quarter and 10.4 percent on year.
