The UK housing market showed signs of a recovery as buyer demand, sales
and fresh listing improved noticeably following the lockdown related
falls, according to the residential market survey results published by
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

A net balance of 61 percent of survey respondents reported a rise in
buyer enquiries in June, which was a strong rebound from -94 percent
registered in May, data showed Thursday.

At the same time, new instructions being listed onto the sales market
rose firmly with the net balance reaching 42 percent compared to -22
percent in May.

The survey's gauge of newly agreed sales moved into positive territory
for the first time since February. A net balance of +43 percent of
contributors cited an increase in transactions in June. Sales are
expected to rise over the next three months.

The house price balance rose to -15 percent from -32 percent in May.
Nonetheless, house prices continue to remain under some pressure. The
house price balance remained negative for the third successive month.

Further, the outlook for house prices turned progressively less negative
in each of the last three months, with June's net balance rising to -12
percent from -43 percent previously.
