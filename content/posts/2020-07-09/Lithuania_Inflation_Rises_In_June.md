Lithuania consumer price inflation rose in June after easing in the
previous month, figures from the statistical office showed on Thursday.

The consumer price index rose 1.0 percent year-on-year in June, after a
0.3 percent increase in May. A similar rate of inflation was seen in
April.

Cost of education showed the biggest annual growth of 8.0 percent in
June and those for [health][1] care gained 7.3 percent.

Prices for hotels, cafes and restaurants increased by 5.4 percent and
those of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 3.0 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in June, reversing
a 0.5 percent fall in the previous month.

This was mainly due to rise in the prices of fuel dental services, other
personal care devices, supplies and equipment, fruits and a decrease in
the prices of vegetables, spirits, heat energy and clothing, the agency
said.
