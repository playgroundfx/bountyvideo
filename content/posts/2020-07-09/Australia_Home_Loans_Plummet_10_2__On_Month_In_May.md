The total value of owner-occupied home loans issued in Australia tumbled
a seasonally adjusted 10.2 percent on month in May, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday - coming in at A$12.31 billion.

That missed expectations for a fall of 7.5 percent and followed the 5.0
percent decline in April.

Investment lending plummeted 15.6 percent to A$4.10 billion after
slipping 4.2 percent in the previous month.

Loans fell 11.6 percent for housing, rose 14.5 percent for personal
fixed term loans and rose 3.6 percent for [business][1] construction.
