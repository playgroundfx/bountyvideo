New Zealand [business][1] confidence improved in July, preliminary
survey data from ANZ showed on Thursday.

The business confidence index rose 4.6 points to -29.8 percent in July
from -34.4 in June.

All forward-looking activity indicators increased from June levels. The
own activity index climbed to -6.8 percent in July from -25.9 percent in
June.

A net 4.5 percent of firms expect to reduce investment, a net 26.0
percent expects lower profits, and a net 3.0 percent expect lower
capacity utilization.

A net 15 percent of firms expect to cut jobs, while a net 21 percent of
firms report having less staffs than in the same period a year ago.

The expected costs and pricing increased in July, while one-year-ahead
inflation expectations fell slightly.

"New Zealand is in an enviable position (touch wood), with activity
largely back to normal, as demonstrated by traffic and spending data and
many other indicators," ANZ said.

"After the rigours of lockdown we deserve a pat on the back and a little
splurge," ANZ added.
