Germany's manufacturing orders grew for a seventh straight month in
November, defying expectations for a decline, suggesting that
manufacturing may have offset the slump in the service sector due to the
second lockdown to battle the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

Factory orders rose 2.3 percent month-on-month in November, figures from
the Federal Statistical Office/Destatis showed Thursday. while
economists had forecast a 1.2 percent fall.

The growth for October was revised to 3.3 percent from 2.9 percent.
Orders have grown every month since May.

Excluding major orders, real new orders in manufacturing rose 1.6
percent from the previous month.

Domestic orders increased 1.6 percent and foreign demand grew 2.9
percent.

Demand for intermediate goods grew 4.9 percent and orders for capital
goods rose 1.1 percent. Consumer goods orders increased 0.5 percent.

On a year-on-year basis, factory orders grew 6.3 percent in November
after a 2.3 percent increase in the previous month.

The latest increase in orders is "undoubtedly good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)" for the German
manufacturing sector and for production, Commerzbank said, which expects
production to increase in the coming months given the positive trend in
orders.

"All this is unlikely to prevent real GDP from shrinking in Q4 due to
the new restrictions imposed to contain the corona pandemic,"
Commerzbank analyst Marco Wagner said.

"However, the very positive development in manufacturing should keep
this decline in check."
