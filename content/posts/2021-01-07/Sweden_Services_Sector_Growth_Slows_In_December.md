Sweden's services sector activity expanded at a softer pace in December,
but remained solid, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics
association SILF showed on Thursday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector decreased to 56.6
in December from a revised 58.3 in November. Any reading above 50
indicates expansion in the sector.

"Even though activity declined in December, it is a continued robust
service [economy][1] that is likely to be supported by service companies
with close links to industry," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

All sub-indices declined in December. Business volume, employment and
order intake decreased and suppliers' delivery time lengthened.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose
marginally for the third straight month to 58.9 in December from 58.8 in
the previous month.
