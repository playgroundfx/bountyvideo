Euro area retail sales fell in November, defying expectations for
further increase, as some countries in the bloc restored lockdown
restrictions amid a resurgence in [coronavirus][1] infections, figures
from Eurostat showed on Thursday.

Retail sales decreased 2.9 percent year-on-year, while economists had
forecast 0.8 percent growth.

October's growth was revised to 4.2 percent from 4.3 percent.

Compared to the previous month, sales fell 6.1 percent in November,
which was nearly double of the 3.4 percent fall economists had expected.

The monthly growth for October was revised to 1.4 percent from 1.5
percent.

The COVID-19 containment measures introduced again by several Member
States had a significant impact on retail trade, Eurostat said.
