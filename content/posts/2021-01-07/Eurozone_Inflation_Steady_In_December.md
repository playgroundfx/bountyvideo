Eurozone's headline inflation and core price growth was unchanged in
December, preliminary data from Eurostat showed on Thursday.

The harmonized consumer price index, or HICP, dropped 0.3 percent year-
on-year, same as in November. Economists had forecast a 0.2 percent
fall.

The core CPI, which excludes prices of food, energy and alcohol &
tobacco, rose 0.2 percent year-on-year, same as in November. That was in
line with economists' expectations.

Compared to the previous month, the headline HICP climbed 0.3 percent
and the core index rose 0.4 percent in December.

Among the main components, the highest annual inflation rate was for the
food, alcohol & tobacco group. The rate of inflation eased to 1.4
percent from 1.9 percent in the previous month.

Services cost inflation rose to 0.7 percent from 0.6 percent in
November. Prices of non-energy industrial goods decreased 0.5 percent
after a 0.3 percent fall in November.
