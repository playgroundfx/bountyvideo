A day ahead of the release of the closely watched monthly jobs report,
the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a modest
decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended January 2nd.

The report said initial jobless claims edged down to 787,000, a decrease
of 3,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 790,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 800,000 from the
787,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also fell to 818,750, a decrease of 18,750 from the previous week's
revised average of 837,500.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also declined by 126,000 to 5.072 million in
the week ended December 26th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims dropped to 5,274,750,
a decrease of 177,250 from the previous week's revised average of
5,452,000.

"Continuing claims for regular state benefits continued to decline in
the week ended December 26, but much of the downward trend reflects
individuals exhausting their regular benefits," said Nancy Vanden
Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

"Claims for state extended benefits - a last stop for many individuals
who have exhausted all other benefits - rose sharply," she added. "That
increase is particularly noteworthy because fewer than half of states
currently provide these benefits."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on the employment situation in the month of December.

Economists expect employment to rise by 71,000 jobs in December after
climbing by 245,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate is expected
to inch up to 6.8 percent from 6.7 percent.
