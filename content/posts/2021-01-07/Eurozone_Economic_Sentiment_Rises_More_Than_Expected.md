Eurozone economic sentiment rose slightly more than expected at the end
of the year 2020, preliminary data from the European Commission showed
on Thursday.

The economic sentiment index rose to 90.4 from 87.7 in November.
Economists had forecast a score of 90.

The ESI's recovery was driven by markedly higher confidence in industry
and among consumers and, to a lesser degree, in construction, the
commission said. Confidence weakened in services and retail trade.

The industrial confidence index improved to -7.2 from -10.1 in the
previous month. Economists had expected a reading of -8.1.

The consumer confidence index climbed to -13.9 from -17.6 in November,
matching its flash estimate.
