Australia had a merchandise trade surplus of A$5.022 billion in
November, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of A$6 billion and down from
the downwardly revised A$6.583 billion in October (originally A$7.456
billion).

Imports were up 10 percent on month after gaining an upwardly revised 2
percent in the previous month (originally 1 percent).

Exports rose 3 percent on month, slowing from the downwardly revised 4.4
percent gain a month earlier (originally 5 percent).
