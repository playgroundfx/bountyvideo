Service sector activity in the U.S. unexpectedly grew at a faster pace
in the month of December, according to a report released by the
Institute for Supply Management on Thursday.

The ISM said its services PMI rose to 57.2 in December from 55.9 in
November, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the service
sector. Economists had expected the index to edge down to 54.6.

"The composite index indicated growth for the seventh consecutive month
after a two-month contraction in April and May," said Anthony Nieves,
Chair of the ISM Services Business Survey Committee.

Nieves said respondents' comments about [business][1] conditions and the
economy were mixed but noted most are "cautiously optimistic about
business conditions with the recent approval and impending distribution
of vaccines."

The unexpected uptick by the headline index came as the business
activity index inched up to 59.4 in December from 58.0 in November,
while the new orders index crept up to 58.5 from 57.2.

The supplier deliveries index also jumped to 62.8 in December from 57.0
in November, although the index is inversed and a reading of above 50
percent indicates slower deliveries.

Meanwhile, the report said the employment index slid to 48.2 in December
from 51.5 in November, indicating a contraction in employment in the
service sector after three consecutive months of growth.

The prices index also fell to 64.8 in December from 66.1 in November,
pointing to a modest slowdown in the pace of price growth.

Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, called the
unexpected increase by the services PMI "hard to square with the range
of other evidence showing that the latest wave of virus cases and
restrictions is starting to weigh more heavily on the [economy][2],
particularly services."

"Like the manufacturing survey released earlier this week, the headline
services reading received an artificial boost from a jump in the
supplier deliveries component, which reflects virus-related disruption
rather than stronger demand," Hunter said.

He added, "But the business activity and new orders components also
picked up, which is at odds with the generally downbeat tone of the
comments in the press release and with the recent dips in the other
services-sector surveys."

A separate report released by the ISM on Tuesday showed an unexpected
acceleration in the pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing activity in the
month of December.

The ISM said its manufacturing PMI climbed to 60.7 in December after
dipping to 57.5 in November, with a reading above 50 indicating growth.
Economists had expected the index to edge down to 56.6.

With the unexpected increase, the manufacturing index reached its
highest level since hitting 61.3 in August of 2018.

However, economists noted the headline index was artificially boosted by
a jump by the supplier deliveries index, which suggested deliveries
slowed at a faster rate.
