The average of household spending in Japan was up 1.1 percent on year in
November, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Friday - coming in at 278,718 yen.

That beat expectations for a decline of 1.5 percent following the 1.9
percent increase in October.

On a monthly basis, household spending sank 1.8 percent, missing
expectations for a loss of 1.3 percent after gaining 2.1 percent in the
previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 473,294 yen, up 0.6
percent on year.
