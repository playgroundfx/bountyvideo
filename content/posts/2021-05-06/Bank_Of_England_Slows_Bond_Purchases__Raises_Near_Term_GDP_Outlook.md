The Bank of England decided to slow its government bond purchase
programme amid rising optimism about the economic outlook with the
easing of restrictions related to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.  
  
The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee decided to reduce the pace of
government bond purchases, a move that [markets][2] may construe as
tapering of the monetary stimulus.

The MPC unanimously decided to leave the key interest rate unchanged at
0.10 percent. The bank raised the growth projections from its February
report and lowered its forecast for unemployment.

The weekly bond purchases will be reduced to GBP 3.4 billion from GBP
4.4 billion.  
  
However, the bank said this is an operational decision which should not
be interpreted as a change in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance.  
  
The central bank retained the existing stock of corporate bond purchases
at GBP 20 billion and the government bond purchases at GBP 875 billion,
taking the size of total quantitative easing to GBP 895 billion.

Andrew Haldane voted to continue with the existing programme of UK
government bond purchases, but to reduce the target for the stock of
these purchases to GBP 825 billion from GBP 875 billion.

The minutes showed that one member sought a reduction in the scale of
asset purchases in the current programme to GBP 100 billion from GBP 150
billion. This would imply that the program would end in August rather
than at the end of the year.

The existing programme of GBP 150 billion of UK government bond
purchases had started in January and its completion was expected by
around the end of 2021.

The next step will be to offer up clues on how it might reduce its bond
holdings alongside future rate hikes, James Smith, an ING economist,
said.

But despite growing optimism about the recovery, a more benign inflation
story next year is likely to see the BoE hold off on tightening until
2023, Smith added.

The MPC said the committee did not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at
least until there was clear evidence that significant progress was being
made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation
target sustainably.

The bank forecast the UK [economy][3] to grow sharply by 7.25 percent
instead of 5 percent estimated in February. But, the outlook for 2022
was lowered to 5.75 percent from 7.25 percent, while that for 2023 was
retained at 1.25 percent.

According to the Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP will rise around 4.25
percent in the second quarter of 2021, as more people are vaccinated and
the Covid-related restrictions ease.

At an online [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) conference, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said lets not
get carried away by economic forecast figures. It will take the economy
back, by the end of this year, to the level of output at the end of 2019
pre-covid period.

That means two years of economic growth have been lost to date, Bailey
added.

The jobless rate is seen at 5 percent this year versus the prior outlook
of 6.5 percent, before falling to 4.5 percent next year and 4.25 percent
in 2023.

Although inflation is below the 2 percent target, it will rise
temporarily above the target towards the end of 2021, owing mainly to
developments in energy prices, the bank said. The rate is expected to
rise to 2.5 percent in 2021 and to return to 2 percent in 2022.
