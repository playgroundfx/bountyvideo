Malaysia's industrial production increased in March, data from the
Department of Statistics showed on Thursday.

Industrial production rose 9.3 percent year-on-year in March, following
a 1.5 percent increase in February. Economists had expected a 7.8
percent rise.

The growth in production was mainly driven by a rise in production of
manufacturing industry and electricity.

Manufacturing output gained 12.7 percent yearly in March, after a 4.5
percent increase in the previous month.

Among other sectors, the mining and quarrying output decreased 1.9
percent, while electricity output grew 10.3 percent.
