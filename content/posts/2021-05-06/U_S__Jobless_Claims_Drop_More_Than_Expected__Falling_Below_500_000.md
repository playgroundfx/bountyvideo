With the more closely watched monthly jobs report looming, the Labor
Department released a report on Thursday showing first-time claims for
U.S. unemployment benefits fell by much more than expected in the week
ended May 1st.

The report said initial jobless claims slid to 498,000, a decrease of
92,000 from the previous week's revised level of 590,000.

Economists had expected initial jobless claims to edge down to 540,000
from the 553,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the much bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims once again
fell to their lowest level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended March
14, 2020.

The less volatile four-week moving average also dropped to a more than
one-year low of 560,000, a decrease of 61,000 from the previous week's
revised average of 225,500.

Meanwhile, the report showed continuing claims, a reading on the number
of people receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, rose by 37,000 to
3.690 million in the week ended April 24th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims still edged down to
3,675,750, a decrease of 6,750 from the previous week's revised average
of 3,682,500.

The drop pulled the four-week moving average of continuing claims down
to its lowest level since the week ended March 28, 2020.

"Claims have declined by 33% since the start of April, further
confirmation that a recovery in the labor market is well underway," said
Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics. "We expect more
evidence of that recovery in tomorrow's April jobs report."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report for April.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 978,000 jobs in April
after surging up by 916,000 jobs in May. The unemployment rate is also
expected to dip to 5.8 percent from 6.0 percent.
