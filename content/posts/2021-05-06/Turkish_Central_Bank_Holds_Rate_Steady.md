Turkey's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Thursday
for a second [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session in a row, after a massive hike in March.  
  
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), led by the new governor Sahap
Kavcioglu, kept the one-week repo rate unchanged at 19 percent, the
central bank said in a statement. That was in line with economists'
expectations.  
  
"Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation
expectations, the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance will be maintained
until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report's forecast path
is achieved," the bank said.

In the March [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, the MPC led by the former governor Naci
Agbal raised the rate by 200 basis points from 17 percent. President
Tayyip Erdogan removed Agbal from the top post late March and he was
replaced by Kavcioglu.

During Agbal's short tenure of four months, the key one-week repo rate
was raised by 875 basis points.

Domestic economic activity is strong despite the restrictions due to the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, the central bank noted. External demand
remains strong. Manufacturing activity is gaining momentum, while the
services sector is impacted by the pandemic restrictions.

"Nevertheless, risks for economic activity exist in either direction
depending on the progress of the pandemic and the vaccination process,"
the bank said.  
  
"Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in
exports, the significant fall in gold imports and the slowdown in credit
amid the tightening of financial conditions support the expected
improvement in the current account balance."

Meanwhile, demand and cost factors, supply constraints in some sectors,
and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the
pricing behavior and inflation outlook, the central bank said.  
  
Policymakers will continue to use decisively all available instruments
in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability, the bank added.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will continue to be determined at a level above
inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong
indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5
percent target is reached, the bank said.
