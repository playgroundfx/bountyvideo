After reporting a sharp pullback in U.S. labor productivity in the
previous quarter, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday
showing productivity rebounded by more than expected in the first
quarter of 2021.

The Labor Department said labor productivity spiked by 5.4 percent in
the first quarter after tumbling by a revised 3.8 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2020.

Economists had expected productivity to surge up by 4.3 percent compared
to the 4.2 percent nosedive that had been reported for the previous
quarter.

The rebound in productivity, a measure of output per hour, came as
output shot up by 8.4 percent compared to a 2.9 percent increase in
hours worked.

"Looking ahead, we expect productivity to strengthen in coming quarters
and remain well supported as the [economy][1] experiences a mini boom in
activity and the labor market lags to overall economic recovery," said
Kathy Bostjancic, Chief US Financial Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Stronger productivity gains should buffer companies' bottom
lines against rising input costs and further boost profit growth this
year amid an expected surge in companies' sales."

Meanwhile, the report showed unit labor costs edged down by 0.3 percent
in the first quarter after soaring by a revised 5.6 percent in the
fourth quarter.

Unit labor costs were expected to slump by 1.0 percent compared to the
6.0 percent jump that had been reported for the previous quarter.

The modest decrease in unit labor costs came as a 5.1 percent surge in
hourly compensation was offset by the spike in productivity.

Real hourly compensation, which takes into account changes in consumer
prices, increased by 1.3 percent in the first quarter.
