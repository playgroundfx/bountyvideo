Malaysia's central bank decided to keep the rate unchanged as
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said the current stance is appropriate and accommodative.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to
maintain the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 1.75 percent, as expected.

The committee repeated that it is committed to utilize its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers
as appropriate to foster enabling conditions for a sustainable economic
recovery.

Inflation is forecast to spike in the second quarter of 2021 due to the
lower base from the low domestic retail fuel prices in the same period
of 2020. Inflation is projected to average higher between 2.5 percent
and 4.0 percent in 2021, primarily due to the cost-push factor of higher
global oil prices.

The economic growth trajectory is projected to improve, driven by the
stronger recovery in global demand and increased public and private
sector expenditure amid continued support from [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures.

However, the bank cautioned that growth outlook remains subject to
downside risks, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties surrounding
the pandemic, and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of
vaccines both globally and domestically.

The central bank decision to keep the rate unchanged today despite the
worsening economic outlook means any further loosening is unlikely, Alex
Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

But with the recovery set to be slow and fitful, BNM is likely to leave
interest rates at their current low until at least the end of 2022, the
economist added.
