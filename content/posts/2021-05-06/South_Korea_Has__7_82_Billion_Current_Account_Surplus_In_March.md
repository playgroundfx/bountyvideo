South Korea had a current account surplus of $7.82 billion in March, the
Bank of Korea said in Friday's preliminary reading.

That was down from the downwardly revised $7.94 billion surplus in
February (originally $8.03 billion).

The goods account surplus increased to $7.92 billion, compared to the
$6.96 billion figure in March 2020. The services account deficit fell to
$0.9 billion, from $1.65 billion in March last year, owing to an
improvement in the transport account.

For the first quarter of 2021, the current account surplus was $22.82
billion - up from $12.93 billion in the first quarter of last year.
