After reporting a sharp pullback in U.S. labor productivity in the
previous quarter, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday
showing productivity rebounded by more than expected in the first
quarter of 2021.

The Labor Department said labor productivity spiked by 5.4 percent in
the first quarter after tumbling by a revised 3.8 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2020.

Economists had expected productivity to surge up by 4.3 percent compared
to the 4.2 percent nosedive that had been reported for the previous
quarter.

Meanwhile, the report showed unit labor costs edged down by 0.3 percent
in the first quarter after soaring by a revised 5.6 percent in the
fourth quarter.

Unit labor costs were expected to slump by 1.0 percent compared to the
6.0 percent jump that had been reported for the previous quarter.
