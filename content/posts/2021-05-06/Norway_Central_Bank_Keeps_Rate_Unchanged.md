Norway's central bank retained its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and reiterated that the
rate will be hiked in the latter half of this year.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee of Norges Bank
unanimously decided to hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at zero percent.

"In the Committee's current assessment of the outlook and balance of
risks, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised in the latter half of
2021", Governor Ã˜ystein Olsen said.

The committee observed that economic activity will pick up through the
year as much of the adult population is expected to be vaccinated by the
end of summer.

Policymakers viewed that there is need for a continued expansionary
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance. There is still uncertainty surrounding the
economic recovery ahead.

When there are clear signs that economic conditions are normalising, it
will again be appropriate to raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate gradually from the
today's level, Olsen added.

Given that the Bank tends not to be timid, the bank is expected to
tighten faster than it currently projects, and that it will also start
to "lean against" the housing market over the coming months, David
Oxley, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
