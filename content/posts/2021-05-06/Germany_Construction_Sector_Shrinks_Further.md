Germany's construction sector continued to decline in April, survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the construction sector fell to 46.2
in April from 47.5 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction
in the sector.

Commercial activity weakened sharply in April and civil engineering work
dropped dramatically.

Inflow of new works declined further in April and average lead times on
building materials lengthened.

Expectation for the future declined to the weakest level thus far this
year from a thirteen-month high in March.

Purchase prices accelerated in April and the overall rate of cost
inflation rose to a record high.

Employment declined in April and the rate of job shedding was the
quickest since November last year.

"April's construction PMI survey produced another set of disappointing
figures, showing the building sector still stuck in a slump amid a
continued soft patch in order books," Phil Smith, economics associate
director at IHS Markit, said.
