Brazil's central bank raised its key interest rate by 75 basis points
and signaled another rate hike of the same magnitude at its next
meeting.

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee, known as Copom, unanimously decided to
increase the Selic rate to 3.50 percent from 2.75 percent.

"For the next meeting the Committee foresees the continuation of the
partial normalization process with another adjustment of the same
magnitude in the degree of monetary stimulus," the bank said in a
statement.

The committee observed that the transition to higher energy prices
should keep inflation under pressure in the short run. The Committee
maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, but
continues to closely monitor its evolution.

Despite the second wave of the pandemic, recent indicators on economic
activity are evolving better than expected, the bank said.
Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth still remains larger
than usual.
