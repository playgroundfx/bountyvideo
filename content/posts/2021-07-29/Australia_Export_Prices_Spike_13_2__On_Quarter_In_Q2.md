Export prices in Australia were up 13.2 percent on quarter in the second
quarter of 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday -
accelerating from 11.2 percent in the previous three months.

On a yearly basis, export prices surged 26.0 percent.

The main contributors to the rise were: metalliferous ores and metal
scrap (+18.5 percent), driven by the demand for iron ore from China and
constrained global supply; coal, coke and briquettes (+15.6 percent),
reflecting the demand for thermal coal for household power production in
Asia; and gas, natural and manufactured (+14.6 percent), due to the oil-
linked contracts capturing the continued rise in oil prices in early
2021.

Import prices rose 1.9 percent on quarter and fell 2.5 percent on year.
