Spain's unemployment rate dropped in the second quarter as service
providers raised employment significantly, following the easing of
restrictions related to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, data from the
statistical office INE revealed on Thursday.

The unemployment rate fell to 15.26 percent in the second quarter from
15.98 percent in the first quarter. However, the rate was above
economists' forecast of 15.1 percent.

The number of people out of work decreased by 110,100 from the previous
quarter.

At the same time, the number of employed persons increased by 464,900
from the first quarter to 19.67 million. On a yearly basis, employment
grew by 1.06 million.

Employment in services grew 365,700 and by 63,100 in construction.
Employment in industry and agriculture rose by 23,000 and 13,100.
