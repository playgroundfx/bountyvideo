Pending home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly showed a notable decrease in
the month of June, according to a report released by the National
Association of Realtors on Thursday.

NAR said its pending home sales index tumbled by 1.9 percent to 112.8 in
June after soaring by 8.3 percent to a revised 115.0 in May.

The pullback surprised economists, who had expected pending home sales
to edge up by 0.3 percent compared to the 8.0 percent spike originally
reported for the previous month.

A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet
closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale.

"Pending sales have seesawed since January, indicating a turning point
for the market," said NAR's chief economist Lawrence Yun. "Buyers are
still interested and want to own a home, but record-high home prices are
causing some to retreat."

"The moderate slowdown in sales is largely due to the huge spike in home
prices," he continued. "The Midwest region offers the most affordable
costs for a home and hence that region has seen better sales activity
compared to other areas in recent months."

The unexpected drop in pending home sales reflected weakness in the
South and West, where pending sales slumped by 3.0 percent and 3.8
percent, respectively.

On the other hand, the report showed pending home sales in the Northeast
and Midwest rose by 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.

The Commerce Department released a separate report on Monday
unexpectedly showing another steep drop in U.S. new home sales in the
month of June.

The report said new home sales tumbled by 6.6 percent to an annual rate
of 676,000 in June after plunging by 7.8 percent to a revised rate of
724,000 in May.

The continued nosedive surprised economists, who had expected new home
sales to jump by 4.0 percent to an annual rate of 800,000 from the
769,000 originally reported for the previous month.
