The unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent in July from about 5.9 percent
in June. The rate was forecast to fall marginally to 5.8 percent.

The number of people out of work decreased 91,000 from June, while
economists' had forecast a moderate fall of 28,000.

weather conditions or strike, the number of unemployed stood at 1.58
million, which was a slight decline of 1.2 percent on May.
