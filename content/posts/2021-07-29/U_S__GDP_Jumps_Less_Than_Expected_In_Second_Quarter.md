A report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed a
significant increase in U.S. gross domestic product in the second
quarter of 2021, although the pace of growth fell short of economist
estimates.

The Commerce Department said real GDP surged up by 6.5 percent in the
second quarter following a 6.3 percent jump in the first quarter.
Economists had expected GDP to spike by 8.5 percent.

The GDP growth in the second quarter reflected increases in consumer
spending, non-residential fixed investment, exports, and state and local
government spending.

However, decreases in private inventory investment, residential fixed
investment, and federal government spending limited the upside along
with an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation
of GDP.
