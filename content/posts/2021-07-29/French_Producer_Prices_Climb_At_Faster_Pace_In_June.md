France's producer prices rose at a faster pace in June, partly due to
the lower prices a year ago due to the pandemic and also due to the
recent surges in prices of raw materials, INSEE said.

The overall producer price index rose 7.1 percent year-on-year following
a 6.7 percent increase in May. Compared to the previous month, prices
rose 1 percent in June after a 0.4 percent gain in May.

Industrial producer prices for the home market rose 7.5 percent annually
in June after a 7.2 percent increase in May. On a month-on-month basis,
domestic market prices climbed 1.1 percent following a 0.4 percent
increase in the previous month.  
  
The prices of mining and quarrying products, energy and water rose 12.8
percent year-on-year after a 10.7 percent increase in May.

Prices of refined petroleum products continued to rise sharply, thought
the pace of increase eased to 62.8 percent from 92.3 percent.  
  
Producer prices for the export market grew 6.3 percent year-on-year
after a 5.5 percent increase in the previous month. On a monthly basis,
they grew 1.0 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in the previous month,
driven by electricity prices.
