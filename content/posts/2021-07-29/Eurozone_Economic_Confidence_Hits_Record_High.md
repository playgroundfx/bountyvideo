Eurozone economic confidence hit a record high in July driven by rising
sentiment in the industrial and service sectors, survey results from the
European Commission showed on Thursday.  
  
The economic confidence index rose to 119.0 from 117.9 in June. This was
the highest since records began in 1985 and also well above economists'
forecast of 118.5.

However, compared to the previous months, the latest improvement was
much weaker, suggesting that the indicator is approaching its peak, the
EU said.

The improvement in the overall economic confidence was largely driven by
industrial and services confidence. Meanwhile, sentiment among consumers
and contractors weakened in June.

The industrial sentiment index dropped unexpectedly to 14.6 from 12.8 in
the previous month. The score was forecast to climb marginally to 13.

At the same time, the services confidence index advanced to 19.3 from
17.9 in June. However, the reading was below economists' expectation of
19.9.

The final consumer confidence index came in at -4.4 in July, in line
with the flash estimate, and down from June's -3.3.

The confidence index for retailers dropped marginally to 4.6 from 4.7 a
month ago. The construction confidence indicator declined to 4.0 in July
from 5.2 in the previous month.

The employment expectations indicator stayed flat in July as more
optimistic employment plans in industry and retail trade coincided with
more cautious reassessments of plans in services and construction.

Selling price expectations saw the fifth month of steep increases in
services, retail trade and construction, while they stayed virtually
unchanged in industry.

Data showed that the [business][1] confidence index rose to 1.90 in July
from 1.70 in June.
