Sweden's [economy][1] expanded at a faster than expected pace in the
second quarter, preliminary data from the statistical office showed
Thursday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent from the
first quarter, when the economy expanded 0.8 percent. Economists had
expected 0.7 percent growth.  
  
Compared to the same quarter last year, GDP rose a working-day adjusted
10 percent after remaining unchanged in the first three months of the
year.  
  
"Year on year growth rates are the highest we currently have in our time
series on Swedish GDP," Statistics Sweden economist Melker Loberg said.

"This should be seen in the light of the severe economic effects of the
pandemic on the economy in the second quarter last year. "
