Export prices in Australia were up 5.5 percent on quarter in the fourth
quarter of 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday -
beating forecasts for a decline of 1.3 percent following the 5.1 percent
drop in Q3.

Import prices sank 1.0 percent on quarter versus expectations for a fall
of 2.4 percent after sinking 3.5 percent in the three months prior.

On a yearly basis, export prices were up 0.3 percent and import prices
tumbled 7.3 percent.

The largest contributor to export prices was metalliferous ores and
metal scrap (+11.5 percent), driven by the demand for iron ore from
China.
