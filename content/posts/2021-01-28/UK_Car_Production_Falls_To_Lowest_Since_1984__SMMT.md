UK car production declined to the lowest in 36 years in 2020 amid the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, or SMMT, reported Thursday.

Car production decreased 29.3 percent to 920,928 units in 2020. This was
the lowest output since 1984.

Production for local market fell 30.4 percent and that for exports
decreased 29.1 percent from the last year. The EU remained the UK's
biggest export destination, taking a 53.5 percent share.

Shipments to the US, Japan and Australia logged double-digit declines,
while exports to China, ended the year up 2.3 percent.

Car production was down 2.3 percent to 71,403 in December, with some
firms affected by border closures and thus component supply issues.

The lobby noted that manufacturing operations were severely disrupted
throughout last year, with lockdowns and social distancing measures
restricting factory output, Brexit uncertainty continuing until
Christmas Eve and depressed market demand in key export destinations.

According to the latest independent production outlook, UK car
production will partly recover in 2021 to one million units. However,
much will depend on the extent of Covid measures here and abroad and the
speed with which showrooms can reopen, the agency added.
