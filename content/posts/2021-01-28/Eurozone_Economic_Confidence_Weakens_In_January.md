Eurozone economic sentiment weakened in January driven by sliding
confidence in retail trade and services as Covid-19 containment measures
remain in place, survey results from the European Commission showed
Thursday.

The economic sentiment index fell less-than-expected to 91.5 from 92.4
in the previous month. The expected level was 89.5.

The industrial confidence index rose unexpectedly to -5.9 from -6.8 a
month ago. The reading was seen falling to -7.2.

Managers' assessments of the current level of overall order books
improved for the seventh month in a row and their production
expectations and appraisals of the stocks of finished products remained
broadly unchanged in January.

Meanwhile, reflecting the decline in assessments of the past
[business][1] situation and past and expected demand, the services
sentiment index fell to -17.8 from -17.1 in December. However, the score
was better than the forecast of -18.8.

The consumer confidence index came in at -15.5, in line with flash
estimate and weaker than -13.8 in the prior month. Households'
assessments of their past and future financial conditions, their
intentions to make major purchases and especially their expectations
about the general economic situation deteriorated in January.

The retail trade sentiment plunged to -18.9 from -12.9 in December. The
slide in retail trade confidence was fueled by managers' assessments of
the past business situation and the adequacy of the volume of stocks.

Construction confidence remained broadly unchanged at -7.7 in January as
managers' improved appraisals of the level of order books were
counterbalanced by more muted employment expectations.

The business confidence index rose to -0.27 in January from -0.40 in
December, data showed.

The economic confidence survey supports the assessment that the euro
area [economy][2] will contract again in the first quarter, Jack Allen-
Reynolds, an economist at Capital Economics, said. With the virus a long
way from being under control, the downside risks to forecasts are
growing.
