A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a continued
pullback in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended January 23rd.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 847,000, a
decrease of 67,000 from the previous week's revised level of 914,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to drop to 875,000 from the
900,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Jobless claims declined for the second consecutive week after reaching a
more than four-month high of 927,000 in the week ended January 9th.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average rose to 868,000, an increase of 16,250 from the previous week's
revised average of 851,750.

"Initial jobless claims were lower than expected last week but remain
elevated, with total claims for regular and [Pandemic Unemployment
Assistance] benefits coming in at 1.3 million," said Nancy Vanden
Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Additional fiscal stimulus and broader vaccine diffusion
should support an improved labor market in the spring, but claims are
expected to remain high in the near term as the pandemic continues to
restrict activity, with new strains of the virus a concern."

The report showed continuing claims, a reading on the number of people
receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, slid by 203,000 to 4.771
million in the week ended January 16th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also fell to
4,998,000, a decrease of 106,750 from the previous week's revised
average of 5,104,750.

Next Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more
closely watched report on the employment situation in the month of
January.

Economists currently expect employment to rise by 85,000 jobs in January
after falling by 140,000 jobs in December. The unemployment rate is
expected to hold at 8.7 percent.
