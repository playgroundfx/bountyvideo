After reporting a substantial rebound in U.S. economic activity in the
third quarter, the Commerce Department released a report on Thursday
showing economic growth matched economist estimates in the fourth
quarter of 2020.

The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product jumped by 4.0
percent in the fourth quarter after skyrocketing by 33.4 percent in the
third quarter. The continued GDP growth came in line with expectations.

Despite the rebound in the second half of the year, GDP for 2020
contracted by 3.5 percent following the 2.2 percent growth seen in 2019.
