Germany's consumer price inflation turned positive in January for the
first time in seven months, flash data from Destatis showed on Thursday.

The consumer price index rose 1.0 percent year-on-year after a 0.3
percent fall in December. Economists had expected a 0.7 percent
increase.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, which is meant for EU
comparison, rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in January after a 0.7 percent
fall in December. Economists had forecast a 0.5 percent rise.

In January, inflation was influenced by the increase in VAT rates and by
other factors such as CO2 prices and the increase in the statutory
minimum wage from January 2021, Destatis said.

Inflation has been in the negative territory since June last year, save
for flat figures in CPI in August and in HICP in July.

The decline in energy prices slowed to 2.3 percent from 6.0 percent.
Food prices rose 2.2 percent annually after a 0.5 percent increase in
the previous month. Services costs grew 1.5 percent year-on-year after a
1.1 percent rise.

On a month-on-month basis, the CPI climbed 0.8 percent after a 0.5
percent rise in December. Economists had forecast a 0.4 percent gain.

Compared to the previous month, the HICP climbed 1.4 percent in January
after a 0.6 percent increase in December. Economists had expected a 0.3
percent rise.
