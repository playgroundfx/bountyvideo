Suggesting U.S. economic growth continues to moderate, the Conference
Board released a report on Thursday showing a continued slowdown in the
pace of growth by its index of leading economic indicators in the month
of December.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index rose by 0.3 percent
in December after climbing by 0.7 percent in November and advancing by
0.9 percent in October. The uptick by the index still matched economist
estimates.

"Improvements in the US LEI were very broad-based among the leading
indicators, except for rising initial claims for unemployment insurance
and a mixed consumer outlook on [business][1] and economic conditions,"
said Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The
Conference Board.

He added, "While the resurgence of COVID-19 and weak labor [markets][2]
remain barriers to growth, The Conference Board expects the [economy][3]
to expand by at least 2.0 percent (annual rate) in Q1 and then gain
momentum throughout the year."

The report said the coincident economic index increased by 0.3 percent
in December following a 0.1 percent uptick in November.

The lagging economic index also inched up by 0.1 percent in December,
matching the modest increase seen in the previous month.
