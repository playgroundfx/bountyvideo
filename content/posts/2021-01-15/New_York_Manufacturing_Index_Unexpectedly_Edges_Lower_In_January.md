Activity in the New York manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at a
slower pace in the month of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York revealed in a report released on Friday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index slipped
to 3.5 in January from 4.9 in December, although a positive reading
still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economist had
expected the index to inch up to 6.0.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months.
