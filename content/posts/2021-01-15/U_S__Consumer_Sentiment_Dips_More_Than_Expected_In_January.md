Preliminary data released by the University of Michigan on Friday showed
a modest deterioration in U.S. consumer sentiment in the month of
January.

The report said the consumer sentiment index dipped to 79.2 in January
after jumping to 80.7 in December. Economists had expected the index to
edge down to 80.0.

"Consumer sentiment posted trivial declines in early January despite the
horrendous rise in covid-19 deaths, the insurrection, and the
impeachment of Trump," said Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard
Curtin.

He added, "Two offsetting shifts helped narrow the January loss in
sentiment: the covid-19 vaccines and a partisan shift in expectations
due to the anticipated impact of Biden's economic policies."

The report said the current economic conditions index fell to 87.7 in
January from 90.0 in December, while the index of consumer expectations
slipped to 73.8 from 74.6.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations jumped to 3.0
percent in January from 2.5 percent in December and five-year inflation
expectations rose to 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent.
