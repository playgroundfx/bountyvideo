A report released by the Labor Department on Friday showed U.S. producer
prices increased by slightly less than expected in the month of
December.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose
by 0.3 percent in December after inching up by 0.1 percent in November.
Economists had expected producer prices to rise by 0.4 percent.

The increase in producer prices largely reflected a spike in energy
prices, which surged up by 5.5 percent in December after jumping by 1.2
percent in November.

Meanwhile, the report said food prices edged down by 0.1 percent in
December after climbing by 0.5 percent in the previous month.

Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices crept up by 0.1
percent in December, matching the uptick seen in the previous month.
Core prices were expected to rise by 0.2 percent.

The modest increase in core prices came as prices for goods excluding
food and energy rose by 0.5 percent, more than offsetting a 0.1 percent
dip in prices for services.

Prices for trade services slid by 0.8 percent, while prices for
transportation and warehousing services edged down by 0.1 percent and
prices for other services crept up by 0.2 percent.

Compare to the same month a year ago, producer prices in December were
up by 0.8 percent, unchanged from November. The annual rate of growth in
core prices slowed to 1.2 percent from 1.4 percent.

"While some sectors have seen prices start to heat up, broader inflation
measures continue to fall short of the Fed's 2% goalpost as the
[economy][1] entered the new year in a slump," said Mahir Rasheed,
Associate Economist at Oxford Economics.

The Labor Department released a separate report on Wednesday showing
consumer prices increased in line with economist estimates in the month
of December.

The report said the consumer price index rose by 0.4 percent in December
after edging up by 0.2 percent in November. The price growth matched
expectations.

The Labor Department said the advance by the consumer price index was
driven by an 8.4 percent jump in gasoline prices, which accounted for
more than 60 percent of the overall increase.

Excluding food and energy prices, the core consumer price index inched
up by 0.1 percent in December after rising by 0.2 percent in November.
The uptick in core prices also matched economist estimates.

The report said consumer prices in December were up by 1.4 percent
compared to the same month a year ago, reflecting an acceleration from
the 1.2 percent growth seen in November.

The annual rate of growth by core consumer prices in December was
unchanged from the previous month at 1.6 percent.
