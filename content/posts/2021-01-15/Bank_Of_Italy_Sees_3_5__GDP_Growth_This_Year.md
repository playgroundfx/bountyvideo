The Italian [economy][1] is set to expand this year and next, but will
return to pre-pandemic levels only in 2023, the Bank of Italy
projections showed Friday.

Gross domestic product is set to grow 3.5 percent this year, after a
massive 9.2 percent contraction in 2020, due to the disruption caused by
the [coronavirus][2], or Covid-19, pandemic.

Growth is seen at 3.8 percent in 2022 and then slow to 2.3 percent in
2023.

GDP is set to rise significantly in the spring on the back of the
expected improvement in the coronavirus situation as countries have
started vaccinating public.

"Starting in the second half of 2021 and continuing over the next two
years, the economic support and recovery measures financed through the
national budget and using EU funds should provide a further boost," the
bank said in its latest economic bulletin.
