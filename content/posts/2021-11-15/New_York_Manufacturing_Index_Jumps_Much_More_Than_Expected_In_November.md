New York manufacturing activity grew strongly in the month of November,
according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
on Monday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index jumped
to 30.9 in November from 19.8 in October, with a positive reading
indicating growth. Economists had expected the index to rise to 21.6.

Meanwhile, the report said firms were less optimistic about the six-
month outlook than they were last month, with the index for future
business conditions tumbling to 36.9 in November from 52.0 in October.
