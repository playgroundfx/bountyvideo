European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Monday that the
euro area inflation is to remain higher for longer than anticipated, but
will moderate in coming months, and it was unlikely that interest rates
would be raised next year.  
  
"If energy prices keep rising or supply constraints persist, inflation
may remain higher for longer than we currently anticipate," Lagarde said
in a virtual hearing of economic and monetary affairs committee of the
European Parliament.  
  
"Overall, we continue to foresee inflation in the medium term remaining
below our new symmetric two per cent target," she added.

Policymakers do see wage growth next year potentially rising somewhat
more than this year, but they assessed that the risk of second-round
effects remains limited, Lagarde said.

Though inflation is expected to moderate next year, but it will take
longer to decline than originally expected.

Despite the current inflation surge, the outlook for inflation over the
medium term remains subdued, Lagarde said, adding that hence, the
conditions that need to be met for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers to raise interest rates
"are very unlikely to be satisfied next year."

Regarding the pandemic emergency asset purchases, the ECB chief said an
undue tightening of financing conditions is not desirable when
purchasing power is already being squeezed by higher energy and fuel
bills. That would represent an unwarranted headwind for the recovery,
Lagarde added.  
  
The bank will announce its plans regarding a further ca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)tion of bond
purchases in December.  
  
"Even after the expected end of the pandemic emergency, it will still be
important that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) - including the appropriate ca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)tion
of asset purchases - supports the recovery throughout the euro area and
the sustainable return of inflation to our target of two per cent,"
Lagarde said.
