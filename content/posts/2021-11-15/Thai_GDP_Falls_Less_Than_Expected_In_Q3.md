Thailand's [economy][1] slipped back into contraction in the third
quarter on tight government restrictions, but the pace of downturn was
slower than expected.

Gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent sequentially, in contrast to an
increase of 7.6 percent in the second quarter, the Office of the
National Economic and Social Development Council said Monday.
Nonetheless, this was slower than the expected decline of 0.8 percent.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was down 1.1 percent, reversing the 0.1
percent rise in the preceding period. Economists had forecast the
economy to shrink 2.5 percent.

The government reportedly lifted its growth projection for the current
year to 1.2 percent from 0.7-1.2 percent. The economy is forecast to
expand 3.5-4.5 percent next year.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of production, the industrial sector dropped 2.0 percent year-
on-year in the third quarter. By contrast, the service sector grew 0.2
percent, lower than the previous quarter. At the same time, the
agriculture sector expanded 4.3 percent,  
driven by crop yields, namely paddy, rubber and cassava.

On the expenditure side, private consumption and gross fixed capital
formation dropped 3.2 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. Meanwhile,
the government final consumption expenditure advanced 2.5 percent.  
  
Besides, exports and imports grew 12.3 percent and 27.8 percent in the
third quarter.  
  
While the economy should bounce back strongly in the fourth quarter, the
speed of the recovery beyond the end of the year will depend on how
quickly foreign tourists return to the country, Gareth Leather, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.
