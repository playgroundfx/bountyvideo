The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its November 2 monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, highlighting a light day for
Asia-Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the RBA kept its benchmark cash rate unchanged at a
record low of 0.10 percent but decided to relinquish the yield curve
control program reflecting the improvement in the [economy][1] and the
faster-than-expected progress towards the inflation goal. The board also
voted to continue with the purchase of government securities at the rate
of A$4 billion a week until at least mid-February 2022.

Japan will release September data for its tertiary industry index; in
August, the index was down 1.7 percent on month.

China will provide October numbers for foreign direct investment; in
September, FDI was up 19.6 percent on year.

Hong Kong will see October figures for unemployment; in September, the
jobless rate was 4.5 percent.
