Spain consumer prices continued to decline in November, preliminary data
from the statistical office INE revealed Monday.

Consumer prices dropped 0.8 percent on a yearly basis, the same rate of
decrease as seen in October. Prices have been falling since last April.

Similarly, harmonized consumer prices fell 0.9 percent. Economists had
forecast prices to decline 0.8 percent after easing 0.9 percent in
October.

Month-on-month, consumer prices gained 0.2 percent but weaker than
October's 0.5 percent rise. Likewise, harmonized inflation slowed to 0.1
percent from 0.3 percent. Final data is due on December 11.

Data showed that electricity prices increased this year and food and
non-alcoholic beverages declined 0.9 percent in November from October.
