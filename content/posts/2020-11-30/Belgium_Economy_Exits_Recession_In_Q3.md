Belgium's [economy][1] rebounded strongly in the third quarter, thus
exiting a technical recession, latest figures from the National Bank of
Belgium showed Monday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 11.4 percent from the second quarter, when
it fell 11.8 percent. In the first quarter, the economy shrank 3.4
percent.  
  
Domestic demand recovered strongly with a 16.4 percent jump in household
consumption and a 15.8 percent increase in housing investment. Business
investments grew 7.3 percent, while public investment surged 20.7
percent. Imports rose 14.3 percent and exports grew 13.3 percent.  
  
Despite the considerable rebound on a quarterly basis, year-on-year
growth remained clearly negative. GDP decreased 4.5 percent year-on-year
in the third quarter after a 13.9 percent slump in the previous three
months.  
  
"So, there is still no question of any return to levels of economic
activity seen before the COVID-19 crisis," the bank said.
