Ahead of second lockdown, UK mortgage approvals increased unexpectedly
to reach its highest level since 2007, the Bank of England reported
Monday.

The number of mortgage approvals for house purchase climbed unexpectedly

approvals to fall to 84,490.

This was the highest number of approvals since September 2007 and was 33
percent higher than approvals in February 2020.

Secured lending decreased to GBP 4.3 billion from GBP 4.9 billion a
month ago.  
  
Data showed that consumer credit remained weak in October, with
households making net repayments of GBP 0.6 billion.

Net lending to private sector companies and households totaled GBP 7.3
billion in October, up from GBP 2.9 billion net lending in September.

The M4 money supply gained 0.6 percent on month taking the annual growth
