The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in November, and
at a faster pace, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday with
a manufacturing PMI score of 52.1.

That beat expectations for a reading of 51.5 and it's up from 51.4 in
October. It also moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that
separates expansion from contraction.

The bureau also said its non-manufacturing PMI came in with a score of
56.4, beating expectations for 56.3 and up from 56.2 in the previous
month.
