Industrial output in Japan climbed a seasonally adjusted 3.8 percent on
month in October, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on
Monday.

That was roughly in line with expectations and down from the 3.9 percent
gain in September.

On a yearly basis, industrial production sank 3.2 percent, missing
forecasts for a fall of 2.5 percent following the 9.0 percent decline in
the previous month.

Contributing to the increase were [business][1]-oriented machinery,
motor vehicles and electrical machinery - offset by weakness from
electronic parts, transport equipment and chemicals.

Upon the release of the data, the METI maintained its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it is picking up.

Shipments were up 4.6 percent on month and down 3.2 percent on year
thanks to gains from motor vehicles, business-oriented machinery and
electrical machinery.

Inventories fell 1.6 percent on month and 7.9 percent on year, weighed
by chemicals, iron and steel.

The inventory ratio was down 3.0 percent on month and 0.5 percent on
year.

According to the METI's forecast for industrial production, output is
expected to gain 2.7 percent in November and then fall 2.4 percent in
December.

Industries expected to contribute to the gain in November include
production machinery, electronic parts and chemicals. Industries
expected to weaken in December include business-oriented machinery,
transport equipment and production machinery.

Also on Monday, the METI said that the value of retail sales in Japan
was up a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent on month in October, coming in
at 12.430 trillion yen.

That beat expectations for a 0.1 percent increase following the 0.1
percent decline in September.

On a yearly basis, retail sales jumped 6.4 percent, exceeding
expectations for an increase of 2 percent following the 8.7 percent drop
in the previous month.

Commercial sales were up 0.9 percent on month and down 2.3 percent on
year at 44.809 trillion yen, while wholesale sales climbed 1.6 percent
on month and fell 6.1 percent on year at 32.379 trillion yen.
