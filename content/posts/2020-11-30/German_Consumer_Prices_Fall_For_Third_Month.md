Germany's consumer prices decreased for a third straight month in
November, preliminary estimates from Destatis showed on Monday.  
  
The consumer price index fell 0.3 percent year-on-year following
declines of 0.2 percent each in both September and October. Economists
had forecast a 0.1 percent fall.  
  
The inflation rate has been influenced, among other factors, by the
value added tax reduction effective as of July 1 this year, the
statistical office said.  
  
Energy prices fell 7.7 percent after a 6.8 percent drop in the previous
month. Food prices grew 1.4 percent, same as in October. Service costs
increased 1.1 percent, broadly the same as in the previous month.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the CPI decreased 0.8 percent in
November after a 0.1 percent gain in October. Economists had expected a
0.7 percent fall.  
  
The harmonized index of consumer prices, which is meant for EU
comparison, declined 0.7 percent year-on-year in November after a 0.5
percent fall in the previous month. Economists were looking for a 0.5
percent decrease.  
  
On a month-on-month basis, the HICP decreased 1 percent after remaining
unchanged in October. Economists had predicted a 0.8 percent slump.  
  
Destatis is set to release the final results for November CPI on
December 11.
