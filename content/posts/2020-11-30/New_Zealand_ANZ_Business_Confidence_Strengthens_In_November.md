New Zealand [business][1] confidence improved notably in November, final
survey data from ANZ showed on Monday.

The business confidence index rose to -6.9 in November from -15.7 in the
previous month. The flash reading was -15.6.

Although negative, sentiment was the highest since late 2017. Excellent
vaccine [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) may have had something to do with the lift seen across the
survey this month, ANZ said.

The full-month ANZ Business Outlook survey for November was more
positive than the preliminary data, with growth indicators including own
activity expectations and headline business confidence lifting as the
month went on, and showing a solid increase versus October.
