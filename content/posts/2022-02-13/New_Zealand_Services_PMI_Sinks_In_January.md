The services sector in New Zealand continued to contract in January, and
at a faster rate, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Monday
with a Performance of Services Index score of 45.9.

That's down from 49.8 in December, and it moves further beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, sales (44.1), employment (48.1), New orders (41.8),
inventories (47.6) and supplier deliveries (43.6) all were firmly in
contraction territory.

"The PSI can jag around quite a lot from month to month - upwards and
downwards. However, it's also worth pointing out that the long-term
average of the PSI is 53.6, which is starting to feel some distance
away. So much for the new traffic light system releasing the brakes on
activity," said BNZ Senior Economist Craig Ebert.
