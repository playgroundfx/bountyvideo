The current monetary stimulus should be maintained for several quarters
at least, and probably longer, Gertjan Vlieghe, an external monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee member of the Bank of England, said Monday.

"And when tightening does become appropriate, I suspect not much of it
will be needed, given the low level of the neutral rate," he said in a
speech to the London School of Economics.

Although the expected peak in inflation looks to be higher than
previously projected, Vlieghe said the view remains the same that this
peak is likely to be temporary.

Inflation is driven by supply bottlenecks and base effects, both of
which are set to wane next year. Second, the UK is not out of the woods
yet in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the virus and its impact on the [economy][1].

Further, he observed that various government support schemes are coming
to an end, including the all-important furlough scheme. Vlieghe said he
want to see how the economy copes with that, before adding monetary
tightening on top of fiscal tightening.

For all these reasons, the banker assessed that the current monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should be retained at least for several quarters.
