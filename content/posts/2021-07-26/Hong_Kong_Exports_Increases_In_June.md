Hong Kong's merchandise exports accelerated in June, data from the
Census and Statistics Department showed on Monday.

Exports rose 33.0 percent year-on-year in June, following a 24.0 percent
increase in May.

Imports gained 31.9 percent annually in June, following a 26.5 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit widened to HK$40.455 billion in June from HK$33.341
billion in the same month last year. In May, the deficit was HK$25,464
billion.

"Exports to the Mainland, the US and the EU all accelerated in growth,
while those to other Asian [markets][1] also expanded by varying
degrees," a government spokesman said.

"Yet, the recent surge of COVID-19 mutant infections may hinder the pace
of economic recovery in some major markets," spokesman said.
