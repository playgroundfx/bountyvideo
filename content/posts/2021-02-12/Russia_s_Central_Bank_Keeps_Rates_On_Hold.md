Russia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged and signaled
that that the easing cycle has come to an end.

The Board of Directors, led by Governor Elvira Nabiullina decided to
retain the benchmark rate at 4.25 percent.

The bank said it will determine the timeline and pace of a return to
neutral monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

This suggests that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are setting the groundwork for a return
of interest rates to the neutral 5-6 percent range, Liam Peach, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

One more 25 basis point interest rate cut to 4.00 percent now looks much
less likely to materialize, but interest rates are likely to remain
lower for longer than [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s currently expect, the economist said.

According to [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers, annual inflation will peak in February-March
and decline later on. The path of the decline will be determined by the
timing of exhaustion of the effect of proinflationary factors and 2020
base effects.

Given the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, annual inflation will reach
3.7-4.2 percent in 2021 and remain close to 4 percent later on.

The bank forecasts the [economy][1] will grow in the range of 3.0-4.0
percent in 2021. GDP in 2022-2023 is set to grow 2.5-3.5 percent and
2.0-3.0 percent, respectively.

Accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will continue to support the economy
throughout 2021, the bank said.
