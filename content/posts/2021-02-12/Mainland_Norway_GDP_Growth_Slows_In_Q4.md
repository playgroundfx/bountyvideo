Mainland Norway grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter as the
[coronavirus][1] control measures were tightened towards the end of
October, Statistics Norway reported Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.9 percent sequentially, much slower than
the 5 percent expansion seen in the third quarter.

Likewise, growth in overall Norway GDP, including oil and gas
extraction, pipeline transportation and ocean transport, eased to 0.6
percent from 4.5 percent a quarter ago.

In December, Mainland-Norway GDP was up 1 percent and overall Norway GDP
by 1.4 percent.

In the full-year of 2020, Mainland Norway fell 2.5 percent from the last
year.

Although the downturn in 2020 was somewhat lower than feared, this was
the biggest fall since records began in 1970, and it was probably the
greatest economic downturn since the Second World War, head of the
National Accounts at Statistics Norway, PÃ¥l Sletten, said.

Despite the pandemic, oil and gas production experienced robust growth
in 2020. Activity levels rose nearly 9 percent. As a result, overall GDP
fell only 0.8 percent.
