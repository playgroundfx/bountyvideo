Reflecting a notable deterioration in expectations, the University of
Michigan released a report on Friday showing an unexpected decrease in
U.S. consumer sentiment in the month of February.

The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to
76.2 in February after edging down to 79.0 in January. The drop came as
a surprise to economists, who had expected the index to inch up to 80.8.

With the unexpected decrease, the consumer sentiment index slid to its
lowest level since hitting 74.1 in August of 2020.

The decline by the headline index came as the index of consumer
expectations slumped to 69.8 in February from 74.0 in the previous
month.

The current economic conditions index showed a much more modest
decrease, edging down to 86.2 in February from 86.7 in January.

Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin said the unexpected
deterioration in consumer sentiment was concentrated in expectations and
among households with incomes below $75,000.

"Households with incomes in the bottom third reported significant
setbacks in their current finances, with fewer of these households
mentioning recent income gains than anytime since 2014," Curtin said.

He added, "Presumably a new round of stimulus payments will reduce
financial hardships among those with the lowest incomes."

On the inflation front, the report said one-year inflation expectations
jumped to 3.3 percent in February from 3.0 percent in January, while
five-year inflation expectations were unchanged at 2.7 percent.
