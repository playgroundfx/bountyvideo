The UK [economy][1] is set to contract more than the previous projection
as stringent Covid-19 restrictions are expected to remain elevated until
early spring, along with the effects of post-Brexit adjustment, the
National Institute of Social and Economic research said Friday.

Gross domestic product is forecast to decline 3.8 percent in the first
quarter, instead of 3.4 percent estimated last month.

"Nevertheless, growth will pick up from the second quarter onwards as
restrictions ease on the back of a successful vaccination programme,"
Kemar Whyte, a senior economist at NIESR, said.

Earlier this month, the think tank downwardly revised the UK's growth
outlook for 2021 to 3.4 percent from 5.9 percent, citing the resurgence
of Covid-19.
