China's manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in May on robust
new orders and production, data published by IHS Markit showed on
Tuesday.

The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 52.0 in May
from 51.9 in April. The reading was expected to remain unchanged at
51.9.

Although mild, the upturn was the strongest recorded in the year to
date. A score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Total sales grew the most in five months, supported by greater demand
both at home and overseas. New export order growth improved to a six-
month high in May.

Production increased in May but the pace of growth softened due to the
material shortage and higher purchasing costs.

Employment was broadly unchanged in May. While some firms added to their
payrolls in order to expand capacity, other companies expressed a more
cautious approach to hiring.

Average cost burdens rose rapidly in the latest survey period, with the
rate of inflation the quickest since December 2016. Firms generally
passed on greater input costs to clients by raising their output prices
which increased at the fastest rate since February 2011.

Manufacturing firms remained confident that output would increase over
the year ahead amid forecasts of rising customer demand and new product
releases. However, the level positive sentiment dipped to a four-month
low amid rising costs and pandemic-related uncertainty.

To sum up, manufacturing expanded in May as the post-epidemic economic
recovery kept its momentum, Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin
Insight Group said.

Inflationary pressure would limit the room for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
maneuvers, Wang noted. The price transmission effect emerged as
manufacturing output prices surged last month. Rapidly rising commodity
prices began to disrupt the [economy][1] as some enterprises began to
hoard goods, while some others suffered raw material shortages.
