A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed U.S.
construction spending increased by less than expected in the month of
April.

The Commerce Department said construction spending edged up by 0.2
percent to an annual rate of $1.524 trillion in April after jumping by
1.0 percent to an upwardly revised rate of $1.521 trillion in March.

Economists had expected construction spending to climb by 0.6 percent
compared to the 0.2 percent uptick originally reported for the previous
month.

With the modest increase from March's upwardly revised level, the annual
rate of construction spending hit a new record high in April.

The report showed spending on private construction rose by 0.4 percent
to an annual rate of $1.181 trillion in April.

While spending on residential construction surged up by 1.0 percent to a
rate of $729.2 billion, the jump was partly offset by a 0.5 percent drop
in spending on non-residential construction to a rate of $451.4 billion.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said spending on public construction
fell by 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $343.5 billion amid a decrease
in spending on educational construction.

The report also showed total construction spending in April was up by
9.8 percent compared to the same month a year ago.
