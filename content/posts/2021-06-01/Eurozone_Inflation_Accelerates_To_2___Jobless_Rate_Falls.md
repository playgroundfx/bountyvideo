Eurozone consumer price inflation accelerated for a third straight month
and at a faster than expected pace in May, while the jobless rate eased
in April, preliminary figures from Eurostat showed Tuesday.

The flash consumer price inflation climbed to 2.0 percent from 1.6
percent in April. Economists had forecast inflation of 1.9 percent.

Core inflation, which excludes prices of energy, fresh food, alcohol and
tobacco, accelerated to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent in April. That was
in line with economists' expectations.

The European Central Bank targets inflation "below, but close to" 2
percent.

Compared to the previous month, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in May.

Separate data from Eurostat showed that the unemployment rate for euro
area eased to 8.0 percent in April from 8.1 percent in March. Economists
had expected the rate to remain unchanged.
