Australia's central bank left its key interest rate and the government
bond yield target unchanged, as widely expected, as it is set to review
the asset purchase programme at the July meeting.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a record low of
0.10 percent.

The central bank retained the target yield on the 3-year Australian
government bond at around 0.1 percent and also maintained the parameters
of the Term Funding Facility and the government bond purchase programme.

At the July meeting, the board will consider future bond purchases
following the completion of the second A$100 billion of purchases under
the current programme.  
  
The board reiterated that it will not increase the cash rate until
actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range.

For this to occur, the labor market will need to be tight enough to
generate wages growth that is materially higher than it is currently,
RBA said. This is unlikely to be until 2024 at the earliest.

While a pick-up in inflation and wages growth is expected, it is likely
to be only gradual and moderate, the bank observed. In the central
scenario, inflation in underlying [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) is expected to be 1.5 percent in
2021 and 2 percent in mid 2023.

The board said the progress in reducing unemployment has been faster
than expected, with the unemployment rate declining to 5.5 percent in
April.

In the short term, CPI inflation is expected to rise temporarily to be
above 3 percent in the June quarter because of the reversal of some
COVID-19-related price reductions, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers observed.
