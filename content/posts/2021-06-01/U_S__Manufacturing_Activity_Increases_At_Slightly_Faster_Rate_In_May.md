Manufacturing activity in the U.S. expanded at a slightly faster pace in
the month of May, according to a report released by the Institute for
Supply Management on Tuesday.

The ISM said its manufacturing PMI inched up to 61.2 in May from 60.7 in
April, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing
sector. The uptick surprised economists, who had expected the index to
come in unchanged.

The modest increase by the headline index reflected an acceleration in
the pace of new orders growth, as the new orders index climbed to 67.0
in May from 64.3 in April.

On the other hand, the report showed the production index slid to 58.5
in May from 62.5 in April, indicating a slowdown in the pace of growth.

The employment index also fell to 50.9 in May from 55.1 in April,
suggesting only modest job growth as companies continue to note
significant difficulties in attracting and retaining labor.

The ISM also said the supplier deliveries index rose to 78.8 in May from
75.0 April, as suppliers continue to experience difficulties in meeting
customer demand. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries.

Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey
Committee noted the continued expansion in manufacturing comes even
though worker absenteeism, short-term shutdowns due to part shortages,
and difficulties in filling open positions continue to limit the
sector's growth potential.

"The manufacturing recovery has transitioned from first addressing
demand headwinds, to now overcoming labor obstacles across the entire
value chain," said Fiore.

On the inflation front, the report showed the prices index dipped to
88.0 in May from 89.6 in April, indicating a modest slowdown in the pace
of price growth.

The ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on Thursday on
activity in the service sector in the month of May. The services PMI is
expected to inch up to 63.0 in May from 62.7 in April.
