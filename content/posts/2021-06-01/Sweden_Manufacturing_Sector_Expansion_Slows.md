Sweden's manufacturing sector expanded at a softer pace in May, survey
data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on Tuesday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector rose to 66.4
in May from a revised 69.0 in April.

A PMI reading above 50 suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

"Despite the decline, it is the fourth highest level in the index's
26-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and shows that the strong industrial [economy][1]
persists even though increased supply shortages may become a greater
challenge in the future," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

All the five sub-indices declined in May. The largest negative
contribution came from the order intake index.

The Swedish manufacturing PMI showed a growing optimism in the industry
to increase production in the next six months, despite destruction in
global trade and storage of intermediate goods, the survey said.

Prices for suppliers' raw material and input goods decreased in May,
albeit at a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly high levels.

Cost pressures increased at the producer level due to higher activity in
industry, rising global raw material prices and shortage in inputs.
