China's consumer price inflation retuned to positive territory in
December after turning negative for the first time in more than a decade
in November, data published by the National Bureau of Statistics
revealed Monday.

Consumer prices climbed 0.2 percent on a yearly basis in December,
reversing a 0.5 percent fall in November. Economists had forecast prices
to gain 0.1 percent.

Food prices grew 1.2 percent, in contrast to November's 2 percent
decline as pork prices increased 6.5 percent from the previous month. At
the same time, non-food prices remained flat.

Dong Lijuan, an economist at the NBS, said food prices increased at the
end of year due to severe weather and seasonal holiday demand pushed up
meat prices.

Month-on-month, consumer prices were up 0.7 percent, which was faster
than the 0.4 percent growth expected by economists.

Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation slowed marginally to 0.4
percent from 0.5 percent.

Another report from NBS showed that producer prices declined 0.4 percent
year-on-year in December, but much slower than the 1.5 percent decrease
seen in November and the expected fall of 0.8 percent.

On a monthly basis, factory gate prices advanced 1.1 percent in
December, the fastest since December 2016.

Consumer prices may slip back into deflation over the next couple of
months due to a jump in pork prices a year ago, but this should prove
temporary, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital
Economics, said.

With economic activity set to remain strong and underlying inflation
likely to rebound, the PBoC is likely to tighten [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) this year, the
economist added.
