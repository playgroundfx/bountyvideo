Estonia's trade deficit decreased in November as exports and imports
rose, figures from Statistics Estonia showed on Monday.

The trade deficit decreased to EUR 62 million in November from EUR 78
million in the same month last year. In October, the trade surplus was
EUR 27 million.

Exports rose 9.0 percent year-on-year in November, after a 10.0 percent
growth in October.

Imports increased 7.0 percent yearly in November, after a 5.0 percent
fall in the previous month.

"In November, a significant impact on trade growth came from increased
exports and imports of electrical equipment and mineral products,"
Evelin Puura, leading analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.

Exports to the USA increased considerable in November, Puura said.
