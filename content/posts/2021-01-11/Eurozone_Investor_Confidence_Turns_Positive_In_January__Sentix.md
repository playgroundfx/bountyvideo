Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence rose to a positive level in January for the
first time since early 2020 as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s became more confident about
vaccination strategy, ignoring the current lockdowns, survey data from
Sentix showed on Monday.

The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index rose to 1.3 in January from -2.7 in
December. This was the first positive score since February 2020 and was
above economists' forecast of 0.7.

At -26.5, the current situation index advanced to an 11-month high from
-30.3 logged in December.

Similarly, the expectations index rose to a record high of 33.5 from
29.3 in the previous month.

The agency said there is a potential for a temporary sobering up here,
because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s seem to underestimate the danger that the economies
are more damaged than the data seem to reflect and that this will only
become visible when the restrictions are actually lifted.

The think tank said the ECB should remain very expansionary from an
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) perspective and this supports economic sentiment.

In Germany, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence strengthened to the highest level in
more than two years in January. The corresponding index climbed to 9.2
in January from 6.9 in December.
