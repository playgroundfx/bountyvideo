Spain industrial production declined at a faster pace in November driven
by the weakness in energy and capital goods output, figures released by
the statistical office INE showed Monday.

Industrial production decreased by adjusted 3.8 percent from the last
year, bigger than the 1.6 percent fall seen in October. Economists had
forecast an annual fall of 2.6 percent.

Meanwhile, on an unadjusted basis, the decline in industrial output
slowed to 2 percent from 6.2 percent.

Among components, capital goods output decreased 7.1 percent and energy
production was down 7.8 percent. Consumer goods output fell 3.6 percent.
Meanwhile, intermediate goods production was up 1.2 percent.

Month-on-month, industrial production dropped for the first time in four
months. Production slid 0.9 percent, following a 0.5 percent rise a
month ago.
