Statistics Denmark showed on Monday.

The consumer price index rose 0.5 percent year-on-year in December, same

The consumer price index for December is affected by Covid-19, as the
drop in price observations has been slightly larger than normal, the
agency said.

Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco increased the most by 17.0
percent in December, mainly due to higher prices for tobacco.

to lower prices for clothing.
