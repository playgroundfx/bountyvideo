Ireland's construction sector expanded at a softer pace in December,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank Construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.3 in
December from 53.5 in November.

A score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Housing activity increased sharply in December and activity on
residential projects expanded to the greatest extend since July.
Meanwhile, commercial activity and civil engineering work declined.

New orders rose for the third straight month in December and employment
increased to the highest in eighteen months.

Suppliers delivery time lengthened as the rise in demand led to an
increase in purchasing activity.

Input cost inflation remained sharp in December, despite easing to the
lowest in four months.

Confidence in the 12-month outlook strengthened for the third straight
month improving to the highest since February.

"While vaccine roll-out plans continue to underpin confidence about
medium-term recovery prospects, this week's further significant
tightening of public [health][1] restrictions, including a closure of
most construction work until at least the end of January, represents a
major setback for the wider Irish [economy][2] and the construction
sector itself, which look set to start 2021 on a weak footing," Simon
Barry, an Ulster Bank economist, said.
