Russia's central bank raised its key rate by 50 basis points on Friday,
citing rising inflationary expectations.

The Board of Directors, led by Governor Elvira Nabiullina decided to
lift the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 5.00 percent. Economists
had forecast a quarter point hike.

The bank observed that recovery in demand is becoming more and more
resilient and in a number of sectors is outstripping the possibility of
increasing output. In these conditions, the balance of risks is shifted
towards pro-inflationary ones, the bank said.

The bank upgraded its inflation forecast to 4.7 percent - 5.2 percent
for 2021. The bank predicts the growth of the Russian [economy][1] in
2021 by 3.0 percent - 4.0 percent.
