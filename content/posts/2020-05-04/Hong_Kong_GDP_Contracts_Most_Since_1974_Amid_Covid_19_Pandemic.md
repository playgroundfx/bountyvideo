The Hong Kong [economy][1] contracted the most on record since 1974 in
the first quarter due to weak domestic and external demand amid
coronavirus, or covid-19, pandemic, the advance estimate from the Census
and Statistics Department showed Monday.

GDP decreased 8.9 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,
following a 3 percent drop in the fourth quarter. This was the largest
decline on record since the reference period of the first quarter of
1974.

This was the third quarterly decline and the economy moved deeper into
the recession.  
  
Financial Secretary Paul Chan said "Our economic situation is very
challenging." He said "We are deep into recession."

Quarter-to-quarter, GDP decreased by 5.3 percent in real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) in the
first quarter, which was also the steepest on record.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that private consumption
expenditure logged a double-digit annual fall of 10.2 percent, while
government spending grew 8.3 percent.  
  
Gross domestic fixed capital formation plunged 13.9 percent.

Exports of goods decreased 9.7 percent in and imports of goods were down
10.9 percent. Likewise, exports of services fell significantly by 37.8
percent and imports of services decreased 25.4 percent.

Looking ahead, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing a severe contraction
of global economic activity, Hong Kong's exports will remain under
notable pressure in the near term, a government spokesman said.

Hong Kong's near-term economic outlook is subject to very high
uncertainties, hinging crucially on the evolving global public
[health][2] and economic situations, the spokesman added.

The government expects the economy to contract in the range of -4
percent to -7 percent this year.

Unlike other economies which may return to normal after Covid-19
subsides, Hong Kong has more challenges ahead, Iris Pang, an ING
economist said.

Even though Covid-19 cases appear to be subsiding in Hong Kong, pro-
democracy protesters are returning to the streets and trade tensions are
heating up again, the economist noted. A longer recession is expected.
