The Indonesia manufacturing sector continued to contract in April, and
at a sharply faster rate because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the latest
survey from IHS Marketing revealed on Monday with a record low
manufacturing PMI score of 27.5.

That's down from 45.3 in March and it moves further beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders both collapsed, while company
closures and entry restrictions disrupted supply chains.

Input costs rose solidly due to material shortages and a weakened
rupiah.
