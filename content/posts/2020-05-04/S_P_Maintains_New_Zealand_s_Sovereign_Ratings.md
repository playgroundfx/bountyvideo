S&P Global Ratings retained the sovereign ratings of New Zealand as
monetary flexibility, wealthy [economy][1], and institutions are
conducive to swift and decisive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions.

Although fiscal and debt profiles are temporarily deteriorating as the
government responds to the COVID-19 outbreak, country's external
imbalances are improving, S&P observed.

The rating agency affirmed the ratings at 'AA' with 'positive' outlook.

The positive outlook indicates that New Zealand's strong fundamentals
would allow its fiscal profile to strengthen after the COVID-19 outbreak
subsides, which would in turn lead to a rating upgrade in the next one
to two years.

S&P noted that fundamentals remain sound as recession and fiscal
measures are set to temporarily weigh on New Zealand's public finances.
The general government deficit is expected to peak at about 8.5 percent
of GDP in fiscal 2021 before narrowing to about 3 percent.

According to S&P, the economy will contract 2.4 percent in fiscal 2020
before growing 1.7 percent in fiscal 2021 and 4.4 percent in fiscal
2022.
