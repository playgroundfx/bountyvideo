The South Korea manufacturing sector continued to contract in April, and
at a faster rate because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the latest survey
from IHS Marketing revealed on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of
41.6.

That's down from 44.2 in March and it moves further beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production fell at its fastest rate since January 2009,
while export demand plummeted amid lockdowns in key foreign
[markets][1].

Reduces operating rates at suppliers led to further input shortages.
