The manufacturing sector in Taiwan slipped into contraction in April,
the latest survey from IHS Marketing revealed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 42.2.

That's down from 50.4 in March and it falls below the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, the Covid-19 pandemic caused output and new orders to
tumble at the steepest rates since the global financial crisis.

Suppliers' delivery times lengthened at the quickest pace on record,
while firms cut employment at the fastest rate since May 2009.
