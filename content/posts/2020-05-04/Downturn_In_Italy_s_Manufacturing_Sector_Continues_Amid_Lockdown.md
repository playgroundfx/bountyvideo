The [coronavirus][1], or covid-19, induced downturn in the Italian
manufacturing sector deepened in April, data from IHS Markit showed
Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 31.1 in April
from 40.3 in March. The expected reading was 30.0. The index signaled
the steepest fall in over 22 years of data collection.

Further declines in factory production and new orders were central to
the deterioration in April. Shutdowns and emergency measures were the
major reasons for the record falls.

Firms reduced workforce numbers further, and at the sharpest pace since
April 2009.

Firms pared back on their buying activity substantially, with April data
indicating the biggest decline since the series began in mid-1997. At
the same time, suppliers' delivery times lengthened to the greatest
extent seen in the near 23-year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

On the price front, the survey showed that input prices fell for the
third straight month amid reports of lower prices for oil and raw
materials. Selling prices also decreased with the reduction the quickest
since August 2009.

Expectations among manufacturers with regards to output over the year
ahead picked up in April.
