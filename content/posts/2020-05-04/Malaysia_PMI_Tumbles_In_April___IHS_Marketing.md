The Malaysia manufacturing sector continued to contract in April, and at
a sharply faster rate because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the latest
survey from IHS Marketing revealed on Monday with a record low
manufacturing PMI score of 31.3.

That's down from 48.4 in March and it moves significantly further
beneath the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from
contraction.

Individually, the demand for goods was severely impeded by government
orders to control movement.

The pandemic caused export orders to fall sharply as other trading
partners were also severely affected.
