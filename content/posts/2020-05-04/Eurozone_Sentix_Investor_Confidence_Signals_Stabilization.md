Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence rose marginally in May suggesting the
beginning of a stabilization phase after undergoing a breath-taking
crash due to [coronavirus][1], covid-19 pandemic, survey data from the
behavioral research firm Sentix showed Monday.

The headline Sentix [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index rose to -41.8 in May from
-42.9 in the previous month. Nonetheless, this was weaker than
economists' forecast of -33.5.

The collapse caused by the administrative measures to halt the spread of
virus went far beyond the distortions led by the financial crisis.

Assessment of the current situation deteriorated to a record low but
light at the end of the tunnel was shown by an increase in the
expectation values, Sentix said.

The current situation index declined to a record low 73.0 from -66.0 in
April. Meanwhile, the expectations index rose to -3.0 from -15.8 a month
ago.

"We are at the beginning of a stabilisation phase, which is already
clearly visible in Germany and especially Austria," Sentix said.

Germany's [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index improved to -35.3 in May from -36.0
in the previous month.

Sentix noted that there is now a danger that recessionary tendencies
will become entrenched if the [economy][2] is too slow to recover.

Elsewhere, the survey of Professional Forecasters from the European
Central Bank said the expected effects of the coronavirus, or covid-19,
pandemic and subsequent mitigation measures have a significant impact on
inflation, growth and unemployment rate forecasts.

Real GDP growth expectation for current year was revised down
significantly. The currency bloc is forecast to shrink 5.5 percent this
year instead of 1.1 percent growth estimated previously.

However, the projection for 2021 was revised up to 4.3 percent from 1.2
percent.  
Inflation is forecast to slow to 0.4 percent in 2020 before rising to
1.2 percent in 2021. The estimate for 2020 was revised from 1.2 percent
and that for 2021 from 1.4 percent.

For 2022, inflation is seen at 1.4 percent and economic growth at 1.7
percent.
