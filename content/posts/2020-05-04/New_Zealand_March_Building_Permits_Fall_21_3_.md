The total number of building permits issued in New Zealand in March
tumbled a seasonally adjusted 21.3 percent on month in March, Statistics
New Zealand said on Tuesday - standing at 2,904.

That follows the upwardly revised 5.7 percent increase in February
(originally 4.7 percent).

In March, dwellings were consented for: 1,722 stand-alone houses; 788
townhouses, flats, and units; 290 apartments; and 104 retirement village
units.

In the year ended March 2020, the actual number of new dwellings
consented was 37,606, up 9.0 percent from the March 2019 year.

The annual value of non-residential building work consented was NZ$7.1
billion, down 0.4 percent on year.

By region, the numbers of new dwellings consented in the year ended
March 2020 (compared with the March 2019 year) were: 14,932 in Auckland
- up 7.6 percent; 4,195 in Waikato - up 7.2 percent; 3,296 in Wellington
- up 22 percent; 5,932 in rest of North Island - up 8.0 percent; 5,446
in Canterbury - up 11 percent; and 3,804 in rest of South Island - up
5.5 percent.

Non-residential building consents totaled NZ$7.1 billion, down 0.4
percent on year. This series can be influenced by price changes - non-
residential construction prices (as measured by the capital goods price
index) were up 5.4 percent in the December 2019 year.

In the March 2020 year, the non-residential building types with the
highest values included: shops, restaurants, and bars - NZ$960 million
(down 16 percent); education buildings - NZ$932 million (down 18
percent); and offices, administration, and public transport buildings -
NZ$926 million (up 0.3 percent).
