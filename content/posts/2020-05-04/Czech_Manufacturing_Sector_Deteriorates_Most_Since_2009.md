The Czech Republic's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace
since 2009, amid [coronavirus][1] outbreak and resulting emergency
measures, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The headline manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to
35.1 in April from 41.3 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates
contraction in the sector. The latest score was the lowest since March
2009.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in April and the contraction in
production was the quickest since the survey began almost nineteen years
ago. New orders dropped at a record pace and new export orders fell
sharply due to COVID-19 outbreak.

The number of workforce was reduced at the fastest pace since the
financial crisis in 2009 and backlogs of work fell at the quickest rate
since the survey began in January 2003.

Business expectation fell to a new series low in April. As firms
endeavored to remain competitive, output charges were reduced despite a
sharper rise in input costs.

"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency public [health][2]
measures took hold across the Czech manufacturing sector in April," Sian
Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, said.

"Although restriction across the Czech Republic have been slowly easing,
companies expect output to fall over the coming year as worries
surrounding the longevity of lockdowns, the timespan of any recovery and
fears of a potential drop in investment drag confidence down," Jones
added.
