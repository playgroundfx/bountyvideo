The Vietnam manufacturing sector continued to contract in April, and at
a faster rate because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the latest survey from
IHS Marketing revealed on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 32.7.

That's down from 41.9 in March and it moves further beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, there were severe declines in output and new orders, while
employment was also down at a record pace.

Firms were pessimistic regarding the 12-month outlook.
