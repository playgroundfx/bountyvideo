Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence rose marginally in May but the current
situation fell to a record low due to [coronavirus][1] pandemic, survey
data from the behavioral research firm Sentix showed Monday.

The headline Sentix [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index rose to -41.8 in May from
-42.9 in the previous month. Nonetheless, this was below economists'
forecast of -33.5.

The current situation index declined to a record low 73.0 from -66.0 in
April. Meanwhile, the expectations index rose to -3.0 from -15.8 a month
ago.

"We are at the beginning of a stabilisation phase, which is already
clearly visible in Germany and especially Austria," Sentix said.
