Estonia's consumer price inflation accelerated in December, data from
Statistics Estonia showed on Friday.

The consumer price index rose 12.2 percent year-on-year in December,
following an 8.8 percent growth in November.

Prices for petrol increased 25.5 percent and diesel prices rose 29.4
percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices grew 3.1 percent in December,
following a 1.8 percent rise in the previous month.

In 2021, consumer prices rose 4.6 percent, after a 0.4 percent decline
in 2020.

"The biggest impact on the consumer price index in 2021 came from
housing- and transport-related price increases, which together accounted
for more than two thirds of the total increase," Viktoria Trasanov,
leading analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.
