Employment in the U.S. increased by much less than expected in the month
of December, according to a closely-watched report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The report said non-farm payroll employment rose by 199,000 jobs in
December after climbing by an upwardly revised 249,000 jobs in November.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 400,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 210,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

Despite the weaker than expected job growth, the unemployment rate slid
to 3.9 percent in December from 4.2 percent in November. The
unemployment rate was expected to edge down to 4.1 percent.
