The UK construction sector grew at the slowest pace in three months in
December largely due to the weakness in commercial and civil engineering
segments, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing
Managers' Index fell to 54.3 in December from 55.5 in November.
Nonetheless, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion.

Respondents noted that tighter pandemic restrictions and rising COVID-19
cases had acted as a brake on recovery, especially in the commercial
sector.

Residential construction activity saw the strongest growth in December.
At the same time, commercial building lost its position as the best-
performing segment, with the recovery easing to its lowest since
September.

Meanwhile, civil engineering activity decreased slightly at the end of
2021, ending a nine-month period of expansion.
