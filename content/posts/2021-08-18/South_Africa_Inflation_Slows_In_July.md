South Africa's consumer price inflation eased in July, figures from
Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 4.6 percent year-on-year in July, after a
4.9 percent increase in June. This was in line with economists'
expectation.

The main contributions to the annual inflation came from food and non-
alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, transport, and miscellaneous
goods and services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 6.7 percent
annually in July and housing and utilities cost rose by 3.8 percent.

Prices of miscellaneous goods and services, and transport grew by 4.2
percent and 8.0 percent, respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer price grew 1.1 percent in July. This
was in line with economists' expectation.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.0 percent in July. Economists had forecast a 3.1
percent increase.
