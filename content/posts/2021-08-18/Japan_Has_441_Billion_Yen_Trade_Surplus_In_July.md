Japan posted a merchandise trade surplus of 441 billion yen in July, the
Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday.

That exceeded expectations for a surplus of 202.3 billion yen following
the upwardly revised 384 billion yen surplus in June (originally 383.2
billion yen).

Exports were up 37.0 percent on year to 7.356 trillion yen - shy of
expectations for an increase of 39 percent and down from 48.6 percent in
the previous month.

Imports advanced an annual 28.5 percent to 6.915 trillion yen versus
expectations for a gain of 35.1 percent following the 32.7 percent spike
a month earlier.
