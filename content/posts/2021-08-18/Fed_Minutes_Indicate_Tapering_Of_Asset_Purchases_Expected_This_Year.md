Most Federal Reserve officials at the central bank's July monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting believe it will be appropriate to begin tapering asset
purchases this year, according to the minutes of the meeting released on
Wednesday.

The expectation of tapering the Fed's asset purchases this year comes as
most participants saw the "substantial further progress" criterion as
satisfied with respect to the price stability goal and as close to being
satisfied with respect to maximum employment.

However, the minutes of the July 27 to 28 meeting showed there was still
some disagreement over the timing of tapering the asset purchases.

While some believe tapering could begin in the "coming months," others
felt a reduction in the pace of asset purchases would be more likely to
become appropriate next year.

Participants favoring waiting until next year saw prevailing conditions
in the labor market as not being close to meeting the "substantial
further progress" standard or because of uncertainty about the degree of
progress toward the price stability goal.

The Fed has repeatedly pledged to maintain its asset purchases at
current levels until "substantial further progress" has been made toward
both its maximum employment and price stability goals.

The minutes showed participants also expressed a range of views on the
appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions
satisfied the "substantial further progress" criterion.

Many participants saw potential benefits in a pace of tapering that
would end the Fed's asset purchase program before economic conditions
met the standard to begin raising interest rates.

The Fed said several participants noted that an earlier start to
tapering could be accompanied by more gradual reductions in the purchase
pace, potentially mitigating the risk of an excessive tightening in
financial conditions.

Reflecting the recent surge in new cases of the delta variant of the
[coronavirus][1], several participants noted their views on the
appropriate path of asset purchases could change if the economic effects
of the new strains of the virus turn out to be notably worse than
anticipated.

The minutes of the July meeting also said the projection for U.S.
economic activity was little changed, on balance, from the June
forecast.

The Fed noted the near-term outlook for inflation was upwardly revised
in response to incoming data, but staff continued to expect the rise in
inflation would prove to be transitory.

With the Fed pledging to provide advance notice before making changes to
its asset purchase program, the statement following the next monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting in September is likely to be closely watched.
