The total value of core machine orders in Japan was down a seasonally
adjusted 1.5 percent on month in June, the Cabinet Office said on
Wednesday - coming in at 852.4 billion yen.

That beat expectations for a decline of 2.8 percent on month following
the 7.8 percent jump in May.

On a yearly basis, core machine orders climbed 18.6 percent - again
exceeding expectations for an increase of 15,8 percent following the
12.2 percent gain in the previous month.

For the second quarter of 2021, core machine orders were up 4.6 percent
on quarter and 12.6 percent on year at 2,521.0 billion yen.
