Slovakia's EU measure of inflation increased in July, data from the
Statistical Office Of the Slovak Republic showed on Wednesday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 2.9 percent year-
on-year in July, after 2.5 percent gain in June. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

On a month-on-month basis, increased 0.5 percent in July, following a
0.4 percent gain in the preceding month. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

Earlier, the statistical office reported that the consumer price index
rose 3.3 percent yearly in July and gained 0.5 percent from a month ago.

The core inflation rose to 3.9 percent in July from 0.5 percent in the
prior month.
