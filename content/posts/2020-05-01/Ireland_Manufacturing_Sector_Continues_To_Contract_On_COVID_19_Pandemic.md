Ireland's manufacturing sector contracted in April as output, new
orders, exports and purchasing fell due to the lockdown associated with
[coronavirus][1] outbreak, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The seasonally adjusted AIB factory Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
fell to 36.0 in April from 45.1 in March. The latest score was the
third-lowest on record after February 2009 and March 2009. Any reading
below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.

There was a record lengthening of suppliers' delivery time in April.
Output and new orders fell at the fastest rates since twenty-two year
survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

The rate of job shedding was sharp in April, matching the pace recorded
in February 2009. Backlogs of work deteriorated at the fastest rate
since September 2011.

Demand from both domestic and export [markets][2] collapsed in April and
new export orders fell at a record pace. Purchasing activity declined
with the collapse in demand due to coronavirus pandemic.

Input price inflation declined to the lowest since March 2016, amid
lower demand for inputs and fall in the global oil prices. Charges were
cut at the strongest rate since August 2019.

The 12-month outlook weakened in April as companies expect a recession
after the coronavirus crisis and the future output index fell to a
record low.
