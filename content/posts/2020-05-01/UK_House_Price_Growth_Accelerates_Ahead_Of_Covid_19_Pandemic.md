UK house prices increased at the fastest pace since 2017 before the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic struck the [economy][2], data published by the
Nationwide Building Society showed Friday.

House prices increased 3.7 percent on a yearly basis in April, faster
than the 3 percent rise in March. The annual growth was forecast to ease
to 2.5 percent. The latest increase was the strongest since February
2017.

The mortgage lender said the impact of the pandemic was not fully
captured as the house price index was designed using mortgage approval
data, and there is a lag between mortgage applications being submitted
and approved.

Month-on-month, house prices grew unexpectedly by 0.7 percent after
climbing 0.8 percent in the previous month. Prices were forecast to fall
0.3 percent.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said housing market
activity is now grinding to a halt as a result of the measures
implemented to control the spread of the virus, and where the government
has recommended not entering into housing transactions during this
period.

Lack of transactions will make gauging house price trends difficult in
the months ahead, he noted.

According to Gardner, the medium-term outlook for the housing market is
also highly uncertain.

Although economic activity is set to contract significantly in the near
term, policies adopted to support the economy should set the stage for a
rebound once the shock passes, he observed.

These same measures should also help ensure the impact on the housing
market will ultimately be much less than would normally be associated
with an economic shock of this magnitude, Gardner added.
