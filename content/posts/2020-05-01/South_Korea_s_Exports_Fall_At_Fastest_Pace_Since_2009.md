financial crisis in 2009, as [coronavirus][1], or covid-19, pandemic
weighed on global demand, official data showed Friday.

percent fall in March, the trade ministry reported. This was the biggest
fall since May 2009.

Shipments to major [markets][2], particularly China, the US and EU
declined in April.

At the same time, imports fell 15.9 percent annually after rising 0.3
percent a month ago.

Consequently, the trade balance posted a deficit of $0.95 billion in
April. This was the first shortfall in eight years.
