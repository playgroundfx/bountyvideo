UK house prices increased at the fastest pace since 2017 in April before
the pandemic struck the [economy][1], data published by the Nationwide
Building Society showed Friday.

House prices increased 3.7 percent on a yearly basis in April, faster
than the 3 percent rise in March. The annual growth was forecast to ease
to 2.5 percent. The latest increase was the strongest since February
2017.

Month-on-month, house prices grew 0.7 percent after climbing 0.8 percent
in the previous month.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said housing market
activity is now grinding to a halt as a result of the measures
implemented to control the spread of the virus, and where the government
has recommended not entering into housing transactions during this
period.
