The euro area real GDP could remain well below the level seen at the end
of 2019 until the end of 2022 under severe situation, the European
Central Bank reported Friday.

The ECB said the high uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic warrants an analysis based on alternative scenarios.
According to the estimate, the [economy][1] could shrink as much as 12
percent in severe scenario.

The annual figure under the severe scenario reflects a quarterly real
GDP growth reaching a trough of around -15 percent in the second quarter
of 2020, followed by a protracted and incomplete recovery, entailing
quarterly growth rates of around 6 percent in the third quarter and 3
percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.

In a blog post on Friday, Philip Lane, ECB's executive board member said
the contraction will be much more pronounced in the second quarter,
since lockdown measures were in full force by April across the euro area
and in many other countries.

He said the bank will further adjust its instruments if warranted. This
includes increasing the size of the pandemic emergency purchase
programme and adjusting its composition as much as necessary and for as
long as needed.

On Thursday, the ECB had strengthened its liquidity supportive measures
as the currency bloc contracted in the first quarter at the sharpest
pace since 1995.
