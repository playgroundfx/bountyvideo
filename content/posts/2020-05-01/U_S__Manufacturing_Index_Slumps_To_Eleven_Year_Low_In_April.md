Manufacturing activity in the U.S. continued to contract in the month of
April, according to a report released by the Institute for Supply
Management on Friday.

The ISM said its purchasing managers index slumped to 41.5 in April from
49.1 in March, with a reading below 50 indicating a contraction in
manufacturing activity.

The manufacturing index showed a notable decrease compared to the
previous month but still came in above economist estimates for a reading
of 36.9.

With the decline, the purchasing managers index dropped to its lowest
level since hitting 39.9 in April of 2009.

"The [coronavirus][1] pandemic and global energy market weakness
continue to impact all manufacturing sectors for the second straight
month," said Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business
Survey Committee.

The decrease by the headline index came as the new orders plunged to
27.1 in April from 42.2 in March and the production index plummeted to
27.5 from 47.7.

The employment index also showed a nosedive to 27.5 in April from 43.8
in March, hitting its lowest level since June of 1949.

The report said the prices index also fell to 35.3 in April from 37.4 in
March, indicating a continued decrease in prices.

Next Tuesday, the ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on
activity in the service sector in the month of April.

The ISM's non-manufacturing index is expected to plunge to 32.0 in April
from 52.5 in March, with a reading below 50 indicating a contraction in
service sector activity.
