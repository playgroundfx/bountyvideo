UK manufacturing activity contracted the most on record as the outbreak
of [coronavirus][1], or covid-19, pandemic caused substantial
disruptions in the sector, final survey data from IHS Markit and
Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed Friday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 32.6 in April from
47.8 in March. The flash reading was 32.9.

Data showed that manufacturing production, new orders and employment all
contracted at the fastest rates in the 28-year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), while
vendor lead times lengthened to the greatest extent so far.

The global pandemic also hit overseas demand, leading to a series-record
drop in new export [business][2].

Business sentiment also remained low by the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) standards in
April. Nonetheless, companies still expect output to be higher one year
from now.

Inflationary pressures remained mild in April. Average input costs rose
only slightly and to the least marked extent in the current five-month
sequence of increase. At the same time, selling price inflation was at a
near four-year low.
