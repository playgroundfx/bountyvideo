The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its April 5 monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, highlighting a modest day for Asia-
Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the RBA kept its key interest rate unchanged at a record
low 0.10 percent and signaled a hawkish stance going forward. The bank
no longer says it is prepared to be patient, noting that inflation has
picked up and a further increase is expected, but growth in labor costs
has been below rates that are sustainable.

New Zealand will see March results for the Performance if Services Index
from BusinessNZ; in February, the index score was 48.6.

Japan will provide final February figures for industrial production;
previously, output was down 0.8 percent on month and 0.5 percent on
year.

The central bank in Indonesia will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
and then announce its decision on interest rates. The benchmark lending
rate (3.5 percent), deposit facility rate (2.75 percent) and the lending
facility rate (4.25 percent) all are expected to be unchanged.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Malaysia are closed on Tuesday for Nuzul
Al'Quran and will re-open on Wednesday.
