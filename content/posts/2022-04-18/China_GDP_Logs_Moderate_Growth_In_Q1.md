China's [economy][1] logged a moderate growth in the first quarter amid
the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions hitting consumption and heightened
geopolitical risks, data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed
on Monday.

Gross domestic product grew at a pace of 4.8 percent on a yearly basis
in the first quarter, faster than the 4.4 percent growth expected by
economists and the 4.0 percent expansion registered in the previous
quarter.

For the whole year of 2022, the government targets around 5.5 percent
growth.

The official GDP figures understated the extent of the economic
downturn, said Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at
Capital Economics. GDP growth looks set to be even weaker in the second
quarter given [the mounting disruption from the recent COVID-19
outbreak][2].

In March, industrial production advanced 5.0 percent, which was faster
than the economists' forecast of 4.5 percent. Nonetheless, the annual
growth was weaker than the 7.5 percent increase in January to February
period.

At the same time, retail sales were down 3.5 percent annually due to the
travel restriction. Economists had forecast a moderate fall of 1.6
percent after logging the 6.7 percent rise in the January to February
period.

In the first quarter, fixed asset investment grew 9.3 percent from the
last year, again slower than the 12.2 percent rise posted in the first
two months.  
  
The surveyed unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent in March from 5.5
percent in February.

Iris Pang, an ING economist said further impacts from lockdowns are
imminent, not only because there has been a delay in the delivery of
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) necessities, but also because they [add uncertainty to services
and factory operations][3] that have already impacted the labor market.

With more cities going into lockdown and the PBoC being cautious with
interest rate support, ING economist said the firm may further reduce
GDP growth forecast from the current 4.6 percent.

Last week, the People's Bank of China reduced the amount of cash that
banks set aside as reserves to improve liquidity.

The central bank lowered the reserve requirement ratio by 0.25
percentage points on Friday. The reduction freed up CNY 530 billion in
long-term liquidity. The weighted average RRR for Chinese financial
institutions now stands at 8.1 percent.
