Reflecting rapidly rising interest rates combined with ongoing home
price increases and higher construction costs, the National Association
of Home Builders released a report on Monday showing a continued
deterioration in U.S. homebuilder confidence in the month of April.

The report showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell to 77
in April from 79 in March, with the decrease matching economist
estimates.

The housing market index declined for the fourth consecutive month,
sliding to its lowest level since hitting 76 last September.

"Despite low existing inventory, builders report sales traffic and
current sales conditions have declined to their lowest points since last
summer as a sharp jump in mortgage rates and persistent supply chain
disruptions continue to unsettle the housing market," said NAHB Chairman
Jerry Konter.

He added, "Policymakers must take proactive steps to fix supply chain
issues that will reduce the cost of development, stem the rise in home
prices and allow builders to increase production."

The continued decrease by the housing market index came as the component
charting traffic of prospective buyers tumbled to 60 in April from 66 in
March.

The index gauging current sales conditions also fell to 85 in April from
87 in March, while the gauge measuring sales expectations in the next
six months rose to 73 from 70.

On Tuesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report
on new residential construction in the month of March.

Housing starts are expected to slump by 1.8 percent to an annual rate of
1.738 million in March after spiking by 6.8 percent to a rate of 1.769
million in February.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, are also
expected to tumble by 2.1 percent to a rate of 1.820 million in March
after falling by 1.9 percent to a rate of 1.859 million in February.
