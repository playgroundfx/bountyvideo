Singapore's non-oil domestic exports growth eased in March amid a
slowdown in shipments of non-electronic goods, data from Enterprise
Singapore showed on Monday.

Non-oil domestic exports increased 7.7 percent year-on-year in March,
after a 9.4 percent rise in February. Economists had expected a 2.9
percent growth.

Electronic exports grew 11.5 percent and non-electronic NODX rose 6.8
percent.

On a monthly basis, NODX fell 2.3 percent in March, following a 2.9
percent decline in the previous month.

Exports to the top [markets][1] grew in March, though exports to Hong
Kong, South Korea and Thailand declined. The largest contributors to the
export growth were the US, Malaysia and EU27.
