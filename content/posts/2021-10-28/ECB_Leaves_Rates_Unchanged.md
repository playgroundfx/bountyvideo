The European Central Bank left its key interest rates and its forward
guidance on asset purchases unchanged on Thursday, in line with
expectations, amid concerns over high inflation.

The Governing Council, led by ECB President Christine Lagarde, left its
key interest rate, the main refinancing rate, unchanged at zero, the
deposit rate at -0.50 percent and the marginal lending rate at 0.25
percent.  
  
Policymakers expect key interest rates to "remain at their present or
lower levels until it sees inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of
the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the
projection horizon," the bank reiterated.  
  
Further, the Governing Council assessed that realized progress in
underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with
inflation stabilizing at two percent target over the medium term.

"This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is
moderately above target," the bank reaffirmed.  
  
Eurozone inflation hit a 13-year high of 3.4 percent in September. Core
inflation accelerated to 1.9 percent.  
  
Asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme, or
PEPP, will continue with a total envelope of EUR 1,850 billion until at
least the end of March 2022 and until [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers judge that the
[coronavirus][1] crisis phase is over, the ECB said.  
  
"The Governing Council continues to judge that favorable financing
conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset
purchases under the PEPP than in the second and third quarters of this
year," the ECB reiterated.  
  
Proceeds from maturing PEPP assets would be continue to reinvested until
at least the end of 2023 and the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio
will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, the bank said.

The ECB also reaffirmed that the Governing Council stands ready to
adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation
stabilizes at its two per cent target over the medium term.

"While a reduction of asset purchases could be closer than some might
think, a rate hike is definitely still far out," ING economist Carsten
Brzeski said.
