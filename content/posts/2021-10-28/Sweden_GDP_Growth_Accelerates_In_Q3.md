Sweden's economic growth accelerated more than expected in the third
quarter, data from Statistics Sweden revealed on Thursday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.8 percent sequentially in the third
quarter, faster than the 0.9 percent expansion registered in the second
quarter. This was also bigger than the economists' forecast of 1.3
percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP expanded 4.7 percent in the third quarter. In
September, GDP was up 3.3 percent annually.

"After a weak August, GDP rebounded in September," Neda Shahbazi,
statistician at Statistics Sweden said. Looking at the quarter as a
whole, a strong July led to this upturn.

The stronger-than-expected growth in Swedish GDP in the third quarter
shows that the recovery continued apace over the summer, lifting
activity even further above its pre-pandemic level, Jessica Hinds, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

However, the economist said the open [economy][1] is likely to struggle
for momentum while global supply chains remain disrupted.
