U.S. economic growth slowed dramatically in the third quarter, according
to preliminary data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.

The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product increased by
2.0 percent in the third quarter after jumping by 6.7 percent in the
second quarter. Economists had expected the pace of GDP growth to slow
to 2.7 percent.

The bigger than expected slowdown in GDP growth came as consumer
spending rose by just 1.6 percent in the third quarter after spiking by
12.0 percent in the second quarter.

Spending on durable goods plummeted by 26.2 percent in the third quarter
after surging by 11.6 percent in the second quarter, while growth in
spending on services slowed to 7.9 percent from 11.5 percent.

"The lackluster 2% GDP advance in Q3 shows that the U.S. [economy][1] is
not out of the woods yet," said Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

He added, "A resurgence of Covid infections cut the summer rebound in
half while growing supply chain issues led to higher inflation and
curbed demand."

The report showed the annual rate of growth in core consumer prices,
which exclude food and energy prices, accelerated to 3.6 percent in the
third quarter from 3.4 percent in the second quarter, reaching the
highest level since 1991.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the third quarter GDP growth
reflected increases in private inventory investment, consumer spending,
state and local government spending, and non-residential fixed
investment.

Decreases in residential fixed investment, federal government spending,
and exports limited the upside along with an increase in imports, which
are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP.

Despite the weaker GDP growth in the third quarter, Bernd Weidensteiner,
Senior Economist at Commerzbank, predicted the Federal Reserve would not
be dissuaded from deciding to tapering its bond purchases at its meeting
next week.
