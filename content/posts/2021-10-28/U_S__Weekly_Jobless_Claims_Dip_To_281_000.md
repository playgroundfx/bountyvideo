First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits decreased for the
fourth straight week in the week ended October 23rd, the Labor
Department revealed in a report released on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 281,000, a decrease of
10,000 from the previous week's revised level 291,000. Economists had
expected jobless claims to come in unchanged compared to the 290,000
originally reported for the previous week.

With the modest decrease, jobless claims once again fell to their lowest
level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended March 14, 2020.
