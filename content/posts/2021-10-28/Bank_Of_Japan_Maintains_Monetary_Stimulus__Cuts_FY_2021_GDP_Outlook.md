The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary stimulus and downgraded its
growth outlook for the current fiscal year as supply-side constraints
dampened production and exports amid weak consumption.

The board, governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, on Thursday, voted 8-1, to hold
the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that financial
institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

According to the latest Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, risks
to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being,
mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the
middle of the projection period onward.

The growth outlook for the fiscal 2021 was downgraded to 3.4 percent
from 3.8 percent, while the projection for the next fiscal was lifted to
2.9 percent from 2.7 percent.

For the fiscal 2023, the growth outlook was maintained at 1.3 percent.

On the price front, the bank said consumer prices are set to remain
unchanged in the current fiscal instead of the 0.6 percent increase
estimated previously.

The projected rate of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2021 is lower,
mainly due to the effects of the rebasing of the index.

The bank maintained its inflation forecast the fiscal 2022 at 0.9
percent and that for the fiscal 2023 at 1 percent.

With the Bank highlighting that risks to both near-term economic
activity as well as inflation are tilted to the downside, the Bank is
signaling that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will have to remain loose for longer, Marcel
Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Further, the economist said rents are stagnant and regular wages are
barely rising so the chances of inflation hitting the Bank's 2 percent
inflation target remain slim.
