Spain's consumer price inflation accelerated strongly in October to its
highest level in nearly three decades, mainly driven by higher energy
prices, preliminary estimates from the statistical office INE showed
Thursday.  
  
The consumer price index rose 5.5 percent year-on-year following a 4.0
percent increase in September. Economists had forecast 4.5 percent
inflation.  
  
The latest rate was the highest since September 1992, INE said.  
  
Automotive fuel prices also influenced inflation to a lesser extent than
energy prices, INE said.  
  
Core inflation, which excludes prices of fresh food and energy products,
climbed to 1.4 percent from 1.0 percent in the previous month.  
  
The 4.1 points difference between the headline inflation and the core
measure was the highest since the beginning of the series in August
1986, INE said.

Headline inflation has risen steadily since March and the core figure
climbed every month since May.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the CPI rose 2.0 percent in October
after a 0.8 percent climb in September. Economists had forecast a 1.2
percent increase. The monthly increase was the third in a row.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, climbed 5.5 percent
annually after a 4.0 percent rise in September. Economists had forecast
4.8 percent inflation.  
  
On a month-on-month basis, the EU measure of inflation rose 1.7 percent
in October following a 1.1 percent climb in the previous month.
Economists had expected a 0.9 percent increase.
