Covid-19 pandemic, preliminary estimates from the National Bank of
Belgium showed Thursday.

percent from the second quarter, when the economy expanded 1.7 percent.
The economy grew for a third quarter in a row.

The value added decreased 0.1 percent in industry and 0.5 percent in
construction. In services, the value added increased 2.3 percent.

sharply slower than the robust 15.1 percent growth in the second quarter
when the economic activity was largely boosted by the vaccine roll-out.
