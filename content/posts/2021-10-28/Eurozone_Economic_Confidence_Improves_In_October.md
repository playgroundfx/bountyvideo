Eurozone economic confidence advanced unexpectedly in October, monthly
data released by the European Commission showed on Thursday.  
  
The economic confidence index rose to a three-month high of 118.6 in
October from 117.8 in the previous month. The reading was forecast to
116.9.

The increase was driven by the improvement in services, construction and
retail trade. Confidence in industry rose marginally, while consumer
sentiment weakened on households' more negative views on their past and
future financial situation.  
  
The industrial sentiment index advanced unexpectedly to 14.2 from 14.1 a
month ago. The score was forecast to fall to 12.5.

The services confidence index came in at 18.2, up from 15.2 in the
previous month and the expected score of 16.5.

On the other hand, the consumer sentiment index dropped to -4.8, in line
with flash reading, and down from -4.0 in September.

The retail trade sentiment indicator advanced to 2.0 from 1.4 a month
ago. Likewise, the construction confidence index improved to 8.9 from
7.5 in September.

The employment expectations indicator rose 1.1 points to 114.5, reaching
its highest reading since May 2018.

The survey showed that selling price expectations in all surveyed
[business][1] sectors continued their steep increase observed since the
beginning of the year and reached new all-time highs. Similarly,
consumer price expectations reached their highest reading since November
1992.

The European Commission's new Economic Uncertainty Indicator stayed
virtually unchanged at 14.0 in October, still at a high level compared
to pre-pandemic levels.
