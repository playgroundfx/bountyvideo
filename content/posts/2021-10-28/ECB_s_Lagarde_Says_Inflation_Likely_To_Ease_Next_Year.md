European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that
inflation is set to remain higher for longer than expected, but it is
temporary and price growth is set to ease over the course of next year.  
  
"While the current phase of higher inflation will last longer than
originally expected, we expect inflation to decline in the course of
next year," Lagarde said in the introductory statement to the post-
decision ECB press conference.  
  
Earlier on Thursday, the Governing Council left its key interest rates
and forward guidance unchanged.  
  
The ECB expects Eurozone inflation, which hit a 13-year high of 3.4
percent in September, to rise further this year. Core inflation
accelerated to 1.9 percent in September.  
  
Lagarde attributed the acceleration to surging energy prices and the
recovery in demand that is out-pacing constrained supply.

Base effects related to the end of the VAT cut in Germany are still
contributing to higher inflation, the ECB chief added.  
  
Policymakers expect the influence of these factors to ease in the course
of next year or to fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation.
Wage pressures are also expected to climb as the economic recovery
progress.

Though the growth momentum moderated slightly in the third quarter, the
bank still expects output to exceed its pre-pandemic level by the end of
the year, Lagarde said.

Consumer spending, which is recovering after the spread of vaccination,
is likely to be damped in the coming months as higher energy prices
impact purchasing power.  
  
Supply shortages continue to cloud the outlook for the industrial
sector, Lagarde said.  
  
"We see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced," Lagarde
said.

"In the near term, supply bottlenecks and rising energy prices are the
main risks to the pace of recovery and the outlook for inflation."
