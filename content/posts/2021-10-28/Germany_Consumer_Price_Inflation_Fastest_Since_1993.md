Germany's consumer price inflation accelerated the most since 1993,
largely driven by higher energy prices, preliminary data from Destatis
showed on Thursday.

Consumer price inflation advanced to 4.5 percent in October from 4.1
percent in September. The rate was also above economists' forecast of
4.4 percent. A similar higher price growth was last seen in October
1993.

The harmonized index of consumer prices grew 4.6 percent on year after
climbing 4.1 percent in September. The expected rate was 4.5 percent.
Final data is due on November 10.

Prices of goods increased 7 percent, following a 6.1 percent rise in
September. Meanwhile, growth in services eased marginally to 2.4 percent
from 2.5 percent.  
  
Energy prices surged 18.6 percent from the last year and food prices
were up 4.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices and harmonized prices gained 0.5
percent each in October. Monthly consumer price inflation matched the
flash estimate, while harmonized consumer prices were expected to grow
moderately by 0.4 percent.

Elsewhere, the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, DIHK downgraded
its growth outlook for this year to 2.3 percent from 3.0 percent. The
[economy][1] is projected to grow 3.6 percent in 2022.

The DIHK said the situation is good at the moment, but the outlook is
disappointing. The lobby does not expect a sustainable, investment-
driven upturn.

According to the DIHK survey, companies estimate their current
[business][2] situation much better than they did in early summer.
However, expectations for the next twelve months are lower than would be
necessary for a sustainable catch-up process.

Monthly data released by the Federal Labor Agency, earlier in the day,
showed that the number of people out of work decreased by 39,000 in
October after falling 31,000 in September. This was bigger than the
economists' forecast of -20,000.

The jobless rate fell to 5.4 percent in October, in line with
expectations, from 5.5 percent in September.
