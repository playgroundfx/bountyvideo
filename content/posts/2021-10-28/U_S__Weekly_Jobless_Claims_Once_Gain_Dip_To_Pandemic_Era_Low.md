First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits decreased for the
fourth straight week in the week ended October 23rd, the Labor
Department revealed in a report released on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 281,000, a decrease of
10,000 from the previous week's revised level of 291,000. Economists had
expected jobless claims to come in unchanged compared to the 290,000
originally reported for the previous week.

With the modest decrease, jobless claims once again fell to their lowest
level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended March 14, 2020.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also slid to a pandemic-era low of 299,250, a decrease of 20,750 from
the previous week's revised average of 320,000.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 237,000 to 2.243 million in the
week ended October 16th, hitting the lowest level since March of 2020.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also fell to a
pandemic-era low of 2,513,250, a decrease of 142,000 from the previous
week's revised average of 2,655,250.

Next Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more
closely watched report on the employment situation in the month of
October.

Economists currently expected employment to jump by 385,000 jobs in
October after rising by 194,000 jobs in September, while the
unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.8 percent.
