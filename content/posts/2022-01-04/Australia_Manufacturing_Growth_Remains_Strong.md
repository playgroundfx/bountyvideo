Australia's manufacturing grew at a softer pace in December, but the
pace of expansion remained strong, survey data from IHS Markit showed on
Tuesday.

The IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 57.7 in
December from 59.2 in November.

A score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Activity rose for
the nineteenth straight month.

New orders and output growth eased in December. Foreign demand expanded
at a faster rate due to easing of COVID-19 restrictions abroad.

Purchasing activity rose in December and the rate of job creation
remained unchanged.

Lead time lengthened at a slower rate in December and backlogs of work
increased. Stocks of finished goods declined for the first time in a
year.

Input cost and output price inflation accelerated to record rates in
December.

The overall sentiment remained positive in December with the hopes of
continued growth.

"IHS Markit forecasts for Australia's GDP to expand by 2.7 percent in
2022," Jingyi Pan, economics associate Director at IHS Markit, said.
