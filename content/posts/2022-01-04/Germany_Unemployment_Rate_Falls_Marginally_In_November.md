On an unadjusted basis, the unemployment rate came in at 3.0 percent
versus 3.8 percent in the same period last year.

The number of unemployed totaled 1.39 million, which was a minor decline
of 12,600 or 0.9 percent from October.

Further, data showed that the number of persons in employment rose by
64,000, or 0.1 percent on October.

Compared with November 2020, employment advanced 0.8 percent, or
378,000. This was the seventh month in a row for which a year-on-year
