UK shop prices grew at a faster pace in December, data from the British
Retail Consortium, or BRC, revealed Tuesday.

Shop prices climbed 0.8 percent on a yearly basis in December, following
a 0.3 percent gain in November, which was the first rise in two-
and-a-half years.

Food prices rose at a faster pace of 2.4 percent driven by the sharp
growth in fresh food prices. Meanwhile, non-food prices dropped 0.2
percent.

The trajectory for consumer prices is very clear: they will continue to
rise, and at a faster rate, Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive at BRC
said.  
  
Retailers can no longer absorb all the cost pressures arising from more
expensive transportation, labor shortages, and rising commodity and
global food prices, Dickinson added.
