Singapore's manufacturing growth improved marginally in December, after
slowing slightly in the previous month, survey results from the
Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM)
showed Tuesday.  
  
The Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector rose to 50.7
from 50.6 in the previous month. In October, the reading was 50.8.

A reading above 50 suggests growth in the sector.  
  
The overall manufacturing sector has now recorded 18 months of
consecutive expansion, the institute said.  
  
The Electronics Sector PMI climbed to 51.0 from 50.80 in November. The
electronics sector grew for the seventeenth month in a row.
