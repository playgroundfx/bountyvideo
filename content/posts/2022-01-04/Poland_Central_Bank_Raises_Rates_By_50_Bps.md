Poland's central bank raised the key interest rate on Tuesday, in line
with expectations, amid the threat of high inflation in the future.  
  
The Monetary Policy Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates
by 0.50 percentage points, the National Bank of Poland said in a
statement. The benchmark reference rate was thus raised to 2.25 percent
from 1.75 percent.

"Amidst further economic recovery and expected continuation of favorable
labor market conditions, as well as probably more lasting impact of
external shocks on price dynamics, there persists a risk of inflation
running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
transmission horizon," the bank said.

"In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to
the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP
interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also
curb inflation expectations."

The previous change in the rate was a 50 basis point hike in December.  
  
Headline inflation hit 7.8 percent in November, largely due to high
commodity prices, a record high increase in prices of CO2 emission
allowances and rising prices of manufactured goods due to supply
bottlenecks.

The ongoing economic recovery and demand driven by rising household
income have also contributed to higher inflation. The central bank
expects these factors, together with a rise in regulated tariffs on
electricity, natural gas and thermal energy to keep inflation at an
elevated level also in 2022.  
  
Meanwhile, a reduction in some tax rates is expected to have a curbing
impact on inflation.

The bank expects inflation to decrease in the longer term, underpinned
by expected fading of some global shocks currently boosting price
growth, as well as by an increase in the NBP interest rates.
