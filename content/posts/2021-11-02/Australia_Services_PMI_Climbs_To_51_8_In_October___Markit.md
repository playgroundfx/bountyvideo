The services sector in Australia moved into expansion territory in
October, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on Wednesday
with a services PMI score of 51.8.

That's up from 45.5 in September and it moves above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The rate at which [business][1] activity increased was moderate and
broadly in line with the survey average since 2016. Panelists widely
noted the lifting of COVID-19 lockdowns underpinned the improvement in
economic conditions.

Demand likewise improved for the first time since June, which was prior
to when the latest COVID-19 Delta wave struck the Australian service
sector hard. Service providers reflected the easing of COVID-19
restrictions in October enabled an increase in demand for services.

The report also showed that the composite index rose to 52.1 in October
from 46.0 in September.

Expansion of workforce numbers likewise continued across both
manufacturing and services, though the rates of growth eased slightly in
comparison with September. Some instances of labor constraints were
reported across sectors as firms attempted to expand their operating
capacity to meet demand.
