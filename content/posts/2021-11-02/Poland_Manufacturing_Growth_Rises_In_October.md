Poland's manufacturing sector growth unexpectedly improved in October,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, rose to 53.8 in
October from 53.4 in September.

Economists had forecast a score of 53.0. A PMI reading above 50 suggests
growth in the manufacturing sector.

Output and new orders increased in October. Foreign sales declined for
the second straight month.

Average lead time for the delivery of inputs deteriorated in October.

Input prices accelerated at the strongest pace for three months and
output prices increased.

Employment rose slightly in October and backlogs of work increased.

For the next 12 months, firms were confident that the production will
continue to increase.
