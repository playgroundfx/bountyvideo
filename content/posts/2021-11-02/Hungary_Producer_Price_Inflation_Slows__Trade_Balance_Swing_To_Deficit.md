Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Tuesday.

The producer price index rose 14.0 percent year-on-year in September,

foreign market prices increased by 10.9 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 2.4 percent in September.

balance registered a deficit of EUR 751 million in August versus a EUR
344 million surplus last year. In the initial estimate, trade deficit
was EUR 467 million.

increase in July. According to the initial estimate, exports rose 5.2
percent.
