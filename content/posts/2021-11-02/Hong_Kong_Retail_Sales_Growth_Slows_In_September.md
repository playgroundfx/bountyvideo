Hong Kong's retail sales grew at a softer pace in September, figures
from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Tuesday.

The retail sales volume rose 4.7 percent year-on-year in September,
after a 10.0 percent growth in August.

The value of retail sales increased 7.3 percent annually in September,
following 11.9 percent gain in the preceding month.

Sales value of jewelry, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts surged
16.2 percent annually in September. Sales of clothing, footwear and
allied products gained 6.5 percent and those of consumer durable grew
29.2 percent.

Sales for other consumer goods and fuels rose by 10.7 percent and 15.1
percent, respectively.

"Looking ahead, the spokesman pointed out that the stable local epidemic
and improving employment and income conditions, together with the
Consumption Voucher Scheme, should remain supportive to the retail
sector in the near term," a government spokesman said.
