Eurozone manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in eight
months in October as supply chain issues interrupted production
schedules and dampened orders, final survey results from IHS Markit
showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 58.3 in October
from 58.6 in September. The reading was also below the 'flash' 58.5.

The indicator signaled the slowest improvement in manufacturing sector
conditions since February.

Average lead times on input deliveries lengthened drastically. Further,
companies lowered their production citing difficulties in acquiring
inputs. Although both production and new orders expanded in October, the
pace of expansion weakened from September.

Subsequently, inflationary pressures intensified across the euro area,
with input costs and output prices both rising at new survey-record
rates in October.

Elsewhere, backlogs of work continued to rise in October, once again
reflecting the ill effects of supply-chain disruption.

Business confidence remained strong and above its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average in
October and the level of positive sentiment slumped to a one-year low.

Among big-four economies, Germany and France PMIs slumped to nine-month
lows in October. Spain's manufacturing activity growth was the slowest
in seven months, while Italy registered a robust growth.

Material shortages and supply bottleneck restrained Germany's
manufacturing output and new orders. The BME manufacturing PMI came in
at 57.8 in October, down from 58.4 in September and the flash score of
58.2.

France's manufacturing output declined for the first time since January
as severe supplier delivery delays left many firms with insufficient
quantities of inputs. The manufacturing PMI decreased to 53.6 in October
from 55.0 in September. The flash reading was 53.5.

Elsewhere, Italy logged its third-highest growth on record in October.
The manufacturing PMI rose to 61.1 in October from 59.7 in September.
Economists had forecast the index to remain unchanged at 59.7.

In Spain, supply-side challenges and rising inflation served to limit
growth in October. The factory PMI posted 57.4, down from 58.1 in
September and its lowest level since March.
