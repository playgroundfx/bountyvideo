The Philippines' manufacturing sector growth increased in October, data
from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 51.0 in
October from 50.9 in September. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion
in the sector.

Output declined for the seventh straight month in October and new order
inflow remained sable after contracting for six consecutive months.

Lead time lengthened in October and input buying rose for the first time
since July.

Staffing levels declined for the twentieth month in a row in October.

On the price front, input prices accelerated in October and output
charges rose at a quicker pace.

Business confidence improved to the highest in three months at the start
of fourth quarter.

"Firms hope that demand conditions in both domestic and international
[markets][1] improve, with looser restrictions likely to support greater
customer demand," Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
