Dutch producer confidence improved in November, data from the Central
Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.

The producer sentiment index rose to -3.8 in November from -5.6 in
October. This was below the average score of 0.3 seen over the past
twenty years.

Producers were less negative about the order book for the sixth straight
month, while their assessment of stocks of finished products was less
positive, the agency said.

There were more entrepreneurs who expected their production to decrease
in the coming three months, the agency said.

Producers were more positive in the transport equipment industry, and
petroleum and chemical industry.
