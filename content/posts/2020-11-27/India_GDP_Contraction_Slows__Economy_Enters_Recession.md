India's economic contraction slowed sharply in the September quarter,
but the [economy][1] entered a technical recession due to the impact of
the harsh lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, or
Covid-19, pandemic.

Gross domestic product fell 7.5 percent year-on-year, data from the
statistics ministry showed on Friday.

The pace of decline was much slower than the record 23.9 percent
contraction in the June quarter as lockdown restrictions were relaxed in
the June quarter.

Economists had forecast an 8.8 percent contraction.

With GDP falling in two consecutive quarters, the economy entered a
technical recession for the first time ever. In the same quarter last
year, the economy grew 4.4 percent.

In gross value added [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), GDP dropped 7 percent in the September
quarter versus a 22.8 percent drop a quarter ago.

Early this month, the Reserve Bank of India said the Indian economy
contracted 8.6 percent in the quarter ended September and thus will
enter a recession.

In the June quarter, growth in the farm sector remained stable at 3.4
percent. Manufacturing expanded 0.6 percent after a steep contraction of
over 23 percent in the previous three months.

Output in the construction sectors and the services industries including
trade, financial services, transport, communication and hospitality
continued to decline, but at slower rates.

The decline in household spending and investments also slowed.

"Looking ahead, encouraging [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on vaccines has brightened the outlook,
but weak fiscal support and an impaired banking sector will continue to
weigh on India's recovery," Capital Economics economist Shilan Shah
said.

"Under these circumstances, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is likely to remain very
loose for the foreseeable future, and we think [markets][2] are too
hawkish in expecting modest rate hikes in 2022," the economist added.
