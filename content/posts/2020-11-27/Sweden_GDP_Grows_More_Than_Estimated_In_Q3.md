Sweden's [economy][1] grew more than previously estimated in the third
quarter, revised data from Statistics Sweden revealed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 4.9 percent sequentially instead of 4.3
percent estimated on November 5. The decline reversed an 8 percent fall
posted in the second quarter.

Year-on-year, GDP was down 2.5 percent versus the previous estimate of
-3.5 percent and a 7.5 percent decline in the second quarter.

The third quarter growth was driven by exports and household spending
following the historic decline in the second quarter.

Household spending advanced 6.3 percent and public consumption gained 2
percent. Gross fixed capital formation grew 2.4 percent sequentially.

Imports climbed 9.2 percent and exports increased 11.2 percent on
quarter.

The central bank had expanded its quantitative easing measures on
Thursday as new restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19
infections lead to a new downturn in the economy. The bank forecast the
economy to shrink 4 percent this year and to expand 2.6 percent in 2021.
