Spain retail sales declined further in October, albeit at a softer pace,
data released by the statistical office INE showed on Friday.

Sales adjusted for [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) effects declined 2.7 percent yearly in
October, following a 3.3 percent fall in the previous month.

On an unadjusted basis, retail sales fell 2.4 percent in October,
following a 2.2 percent decline in the previous month.

On a month-on-month basis, retail sales rose 0.2 percent in October,
after a 0.3 percent decrease in the prior month.

The latest growth was mainly due to the rise in sale of food by 3.0
percent and household equipment by 0.9 percent.
