Finland's consumer and industrial confidence improved in November,
separate surveys data from Statistics Finland and the Confederation of
Finnish Industries EK showed on Friday.

The consumer sentiment index rose to -4.8 in November from -6.9 in
October, the statistical office said.

Among the four components, the indexes for expectations on one's own
[economy][1] and for Finland's economy improved slightly in November.

Meanwhile, views on consumers' own economy at present weakened in
November and consumers' intentions to spend money on durable good fell
slightly.

The data was collected from 1,157 persons resident in Finland between
November 1 and 18.

Elsewhere, data from the Confederation of Finnish Industries showed that
the manufacturing confidence index rose one point to -14 in November
from -15 in October. The reading was well below the long-term average of
+1.

The construction confidence indicator remained unchanged at -16 in
November. This was below its long-term average of -6.

The service sector confidence indicator remained unchanged at -11 points
in November.

The retail trade confidence increased four points to -3 in November,
which was below the long-term average of -1.

"Due to the second wave of the [coronavirus][2], it is likely to be very
difficult 3-4 months and there is no information on how long the
recovery from this winter will last in the economy," Sami Pakarinen, the
leading economist at EK, said.
