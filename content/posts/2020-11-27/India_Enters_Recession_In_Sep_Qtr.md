India's [economy][1] entered a recession in the September quarter though
the pace of contraction slowed markedly due to the relaxation of
lockdown measures, official data revealed Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product fell 7.5 percent year-on-year, slower than the
record 23.9 percent contraction posted in the June quarter, data from
the statistics ministry showed.

With the second consecutive fall in GDP, the economy entered a technical
recession.  
  
Nonetheless, the pace of fall in GDP was slower than the economists'
forecast of -8.8 percent. In the same period last year, GDP was up 4.4
percent.

In gross value added [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), GDP dropped 7 percent in the September
quarter versus a 22.8 percent drop a quarter ago.

Early this month, the Reserve Bank of India said the Indian economy
contracted 8.6 percent in the quarter ended September.
