Hungary's producer prices rose for the second straight month in July,
figures from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on
Wednesday.

The producer price index rose 3.4 percent year-on-year in July,
following a 3.1 percent increase June.

The development of prices was influenced by economic trends due to the
[coronavirus][1] epidemic, their impact was felt in the forint exchange
rate changes and the world market prices of raw and base materials, the
agency said.

Domestic market producer prices fell 0.2 percent in July, while foreign
market prices grew 5.3 percent.
