UK shop prices declined at a faster pace in August, data from the
British Retail Consortium revealed Wednesday.

Shop prices fell 1.6 percent from last year, following a 1.3 percent
drop in July.

The fall was largely driven by a 3.4 percent decrease in non-food
prices. At the same time, food inflation slowed to 1.3 percent.

The faster rate of decline was driven by cheaper Non-Food goods, as many
retailers have continued to run promotions and sales in order to entice
customers to spend and make up for lost ground during lockdown, Helen
Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

Meanwhile, the availability of fresh, seasonal produce has allowed food
inflation to ease, Dickinson added.

However, Dickinson said these lower prices are already under threat from
increased costs associated with implementing [coronavirus][1] safety
measures and are certain to rise if the UK ends the transition period
without a trade deal with the EU.
