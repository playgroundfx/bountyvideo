New orders for U.S. manufactured goods showed another substantial
increase in the month of July, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department on Wednesday.

The Commerce Department said factory orders soared by 6.4 percent in
July, matching the upwardly revised spike seen in June.

Economists had expected factory orders to surge up by 6.0 percent
compared to the 6.2 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

Factory orders continued to spike as orders for durable goods
skyrocketed by 11.4 percent in July after soaring by 7.7 percent in
June. Orders for transportation equipment led the way higher.

The Commerce Department said orders for non-durable goods also increased
by 1.8 percent in July after jumping by 5.3 percent in June.

The report also showed a continued increase in shipments of manufactured
goods, which surged up by 4.6 percent in July after spiking by 10.0
percent in June.

Meanwhile, inventories of manufactured goods fell by 0.5 percent in July
after rising by 0.5 percent in the previous month.

With shipments jumping and inventories falling, the inventories-to-
shipments dropped to 1.43 in July from 1.51 in June.
