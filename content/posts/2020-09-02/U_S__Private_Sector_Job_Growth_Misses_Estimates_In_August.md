Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing much weaker
than expected private sector job growth in the month of August.

ADP said private sector employment increased by 428,000 jobs in August
after rising by an upwardly revised 212,000 jobs in July.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 950,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 167,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

"The August job postings demonstrate a slow recovery," said Ahu
Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute.

She added, "Job gains are minimal, and businesses across all sizes and
sectors have yet to come close to their pre-COVID-19 employment levels."

The report said employment in the service-providing sector climbed by
389,000 jobs in August, reflecting notable job growth in the leisure and
hospitality and healthcare and social assistance industries.

Employment in the goods-producing sector edged up by 40,000 jobs, as the
construction industry added 28,000 jobs and manufacturing employment
inched up by 9,000 jobs.

ADP also said employment at large businesses jumped by 298,000 jobs,
while employment at mid-sized and small businesses rose by 79,000 jobs
and 52,000 jobs, respectively.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 1.400 million jobs in
August after surging up by 1.763 million jobs in July. The unemployment
rate is expected to dip to 9.8 percent from 10.2 percent.

"The ADP figures massively overstated the slowdown in payroll growth in
July, but we suspect they will be closer to the mark in August," said
Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "Note the official non-farm payrolls figure will be boosted by
the nearly 250,000 temporary Census hires last month, which are not
counted in the ADP measure."
