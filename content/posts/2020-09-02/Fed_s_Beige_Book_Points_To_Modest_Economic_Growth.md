Economic activity in the U.S. has increased over the past several weeks,
according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, although the gains were
described as generally modest.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in the twelve Fed districts, also noted economic activity
remains well below levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Fed said manufacturing rose in most districts amid increased
activity at ports and among transportation and distribution firms.

Consumer spending also continued to pick up, the report said, with the
increase reflecting strong vehicle sales and some improvements in
tourism and retail sectors.

However, the Fed noted many districts reported a slowing pace of growth
in these areas, and total spending was still far below pre-pandemic
levels.

The Beige Book also said commercial construction decreased and
commercial real estate remained in contraction, while residential
construction was described a bright spot, showing growth and resilience
in many districts.

The report said employment increased overall, with gains in
manufacturing cited most often, but some districts reported slowing job
growth and increased hiring volatility.

On the inflation front, the Fed said price pressures increased since the
last Beige Book in July but remained modest.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently announced a shift with regard to the
price-stability side of the central bank's dual mandate and the adoption
of a "flexible form of average inflation targeting."

Powell's comments last Thursday were seen as an indication the Fed will
leave interest rates at near-zero levels for the foreseeable future even
if there is an acceleration in the pace of inflation.

Looking ahead, the Beige Book said the overall outlook among [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s
was modestly optimistic, but a few districts noted some pessimism.

"Continued uncertainty and volatility related to the pandemic, and its
negative effect on consumer and [business][1] activity, was a theme
echoed across the country," the Fed said.
