The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is actively preparing a package of
additional monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools to use if needed, Governor Adrian Orr
said in a speech delivered to the Victoria University School of
Government and Policy Studies, on Wednesday.

The package will ensure that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain effective and
operate without undue risk, the banker noted.

He said the additional tools include negative wholesale interest rates,
further quantitative easing, direct lending to banks, and ongoing
forward guidance.

The central banker urged banks to use their risk models, and capital and
liquidity headroom, to support their customers' best long-term
interests. "Banks need to make the appropriate risk-reward decisions
that endure over time," said Orr.

At the August meeting, the RBNZ had expanded its asset purchase
programme up to NZ$100 billion and retained its key interest rate at
0.25 percent.
