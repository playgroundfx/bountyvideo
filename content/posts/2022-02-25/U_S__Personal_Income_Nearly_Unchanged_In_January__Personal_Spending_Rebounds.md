With an increase in compensation largely offset by a decrease in
government benefits, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday
showing U.S. personal income was virtually unchanged in the month of
January.

The Commerce Department said personal income inched up by less than a
tenth of a percent in January after rising by an upwardly revised 0.4
percent in December.

Economists had expected personal income to dip by 0.3 percent compared
to the 0.3 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, crept up by 0.1 percent in January following a 0.2 percent uptick
in December.

Excluding price changes, however, real disposable income fell by 0.5
percent in January after dipping by 0.3 percent in the previous month.

Meanwhile, the report showed personal spending spiked by 2.1 percent in
January after falling by a downwardly revised 0.8 percent in December.

Personal spending was expected to jump by 1.5 percent compared to the
0.6 percent decrease originally reported for the previous month.

Real personal spending, which excludes price changes, shot up by 1.5
percent in January following a 1.3 percent slump in December.

Reflecting the jump in spending, personal saving as a percentage of
disposable income tumbled to 6.4 percent in January from 8.2 percent in
December.

"The reacceleration in consumption indicates the [economy][1] started
the year on a stronger foundation," said Lydia Boussour, Lead U.S.
Economist at Oxford Economics. "And the rapid improvement in the public
health situation has set the stage for robust consumption growth ahead,
with the rotation of spending towards services likely to regain some
traction."

He added, "Yet, ever higher inflation and financial market turbulence
triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict could temper consumers'
willingness and ability to spend."

A reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal Reserve
showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth accelerated to 5.2
percent in January from 4.9percent in December.

The annual rate of core consumer price growth slightly exceeded the 5.1
percent expected by economists, reaching the highest level since April
1983.
