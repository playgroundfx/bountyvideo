New Zealand retail sales rebounded in the fourth quarter as expansion in
many industries almost reversed the falls recorded in the lockdown
period of the third quarter, Stats NZ said Friday.

Retail sales volume grew 8.6 percent, in contrast to the 8.2 percent
fall in the third quarter.

Data showed that strong increases were seen in motor vehicles and parts
retailing, up 22 percent, and in the hardware, building, and garden
supplies industry, up 33 percent.

"We are most likely seeing a surge in sales following the longer period
of Covid-19 lockdowns, especially in the Auckland region," retail
[business][1] manager Evie Rolinson-Purchase said.

"Some New Zealanders maybe choosing to upgrade their vehicles or
undertake home improvements rather than spending on overseas holidays,"
Rolinson-Purchase added.  
  
Total retail sales values reached its highest level of NZ$31 billion in
the fourth quarter, up 8.8 percent on the December 2020 quarter.

Over the coming year, the strength of spending will be challenged by two
key developments, Satish Ranchhod, an economist at Westpac, said. First
is the rise in consumer prices, which is squeezing households' spending
power. Adding to the downwards pressure on spending, mortgage rates are
pushing higher.

At the same time, the cooling in the housing market and hit to
households' balance sheets is likely to affect confidence and spending
appetites.
