France's economic growth eased as initially estimated in the fourth
quarter, revised data from the statistical office Insee revealed on
Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.7 percent sequentially, slower than the
3.1 percent growth posted in the third quarter. The rate came in line
with the estimate published on January 28.

GDP exceeded the pre-crisis level by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

On the expenditure-side, household spending and government expenditure
rose 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. Gross fixed capital
formation was up 0.6 percent.

Exports were up 3.1 percent and imports gained 3.9 percent in the fourth
quarter. Thus, the contribution of foreign trade to the GDP's growth was
slightly negative, by -0.3 points.

Finally, the inventory changes made a positive contribution of 0.5
points to growth.  
  
On average over 2021, the economic activity rebounded strongly by 7.0
percent after contracting 8.0 percent in 2020.

Another report from Insee showed that household spending decreased 1.5
percent in January due to a 2.3 percent fall in manufactured goods
consumption and the 1.2 percent decrease in food consumption.

Economists had forecast household consumption to fall 0.5 percent after
a nil growth in December.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said retail sales
volume except that of motor vehicles and motorcycles is set to fall 0.9
percent in January.

In December, the volume of sales in trade decreased 1.2 percent,
following a 1.4 percent growth in November.

From November to January, retail sales are estimated to grow 9.2 percent
from the last year, with a base effect due to the second lockdown.
