Industrial output in South Korea was up a seasonally adjusted 1.6
percent on month in July, Statistics Korea said on Monday - shy of
expectations for an increase of 1.9 percent and down from 7.2 percent in
June.

On a yearly basis, industrial production sank 2.5 percent - again
missing forecasts for a drop of 1.2 percent after easing 0.5 percent in
the previous month.

The index of all industry production added 0.1 percent on month but sank
1.6 percent on year. That follows the 4.1 percent monthly gain and the
0.7 percent yearly increase in June.
