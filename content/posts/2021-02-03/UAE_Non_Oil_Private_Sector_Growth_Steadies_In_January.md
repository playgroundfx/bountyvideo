The UAE non-oil private sector grew at a stable pace in January, survey
results from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.2 in January, same as seen in
December. A score above 50 indicates expansion.

Output grew at a softer pace from December's five-month high. New
[business][1] and total sales increased in January.

Employment grew in January. Purchasing activity expanded and inventories
increased.

Input costs declined at the fastest rate since April last year. Purchase
price inflation eased.

"The rapid roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in the UAE should help to
restore confidence in [markets][2] over the first half of 2021, although
firms were still relatively downbeat about future growth in January,"
IHS Markit economist David Owen said.
