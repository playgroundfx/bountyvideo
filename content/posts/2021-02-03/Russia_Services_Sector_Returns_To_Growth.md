Russia's service sector expanded in January after three months of
contraction, on better demand and sales, survey results from IHS Markit
showed on Wednesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 52.7 in January from
48.0 in December. A score below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.

New [business][1] grew for the first time since September last year. The
increase was modest.

Total sales increased in January. Export demand declined for the
eleventh straight month.

Cost inflation eased for the second month in a row in January. Charged
inflation was the softest since July 2020.

The degree of confidence in the outlook for the next 12 months was the
highest since October 2019.

Employment declined at the slowest pace in the current five-month
sequence of decrease. Backlogs of work rose for the first time since
November 2017.

The composite output index increased to 52.3 in January from 48.3 in the
previous month.
