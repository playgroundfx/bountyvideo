The Swedish service sector expansion accelerated further in January,
partly on hopes that the [coronavirus][1] vaccine roll out will help to
boost activity.  
  
The purchasing manager's index for the services sector rose to 59.3 from
a revised 56.9 in December, survey data from the Swedbank and the
logistics association Silf showed Wednesday.

A reading above 50 suggests growth in the sector and the score signaled
growth for an eighth month in a row.

The PMI reading was above its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average of 55.4 for the fourth
successive month.  
  
The outcome shows a robust service [economy][2] probably supported by
service companies with close links to the industry, but also increased
expectations that the corona vaccine will lift the service economy,
Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

The composite PMI climbed to 60.2 in January from 59.1 in December,
marking its highest level since June 2018.  
  
The [business][3] confidence has strengthened at the beginning of 2021
and businesses at the same time are showing resilience against the
increased spread of infection and the authorities' stricter
restrictions, even though the danger is not over, Kennemar added.
