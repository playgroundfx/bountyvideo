The UK service sector contracted at the fastest pace in eight months in
January due to the impact of restrictions related to the Covid-19
pandemic on trade and temporary [business][1] closures amid the third
national lockdown, final survey results from IHS Markit showed
Wednesday.

The Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply services
Purchasing Managers' Index plunged to 41.2 from 50.4 in December. A
score below 50 indicates contraction. The flash score was 40.6.

Driven by the downturn in services, the composite output index declined
to 41.2 in January from 50.4 in December and below the flash 40.6. The
pace of decline was the fastest since May 2020.

While the UK [economy][2] is on course to contract sharply during the
first quarter of 2021, businesses remain confident that pent up demand
and an easing of pandemic restrictions will provide a springboard to
recovery later this year, Tim Moore, an economics director at IHS
Markit, said.

Total volumes of new work across the service economy decreased at a
sharp pace in January. New business from abroad continued to fall at a
steeper pace than domestic sales.

Further, staffing numbers declined for the eleventh straight month.
Higher input costs have been recorded in each of the past seven months,
with the latest rise driven by transport expenses and higher salary
payments.

Despite a sharp downturn in client demand due to the pandemic, the
latest survey indicated that business optimism improved for the third
consecutive month to the strongest since May 2014.
