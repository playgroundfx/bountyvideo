China's service sector growth slowed at the start of the year as demand
was dampened by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Wednesday.  
  
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.0 in January
from 56.3 in December. However, a score above 50 indicates expansion in
the sector.

The reading signaled the slowest rate of growth recorded over the
current nine-month period of expansion.

New work received by services companies grew at the slowest rate since
last August. New orders from overseas gained at the weakest pace in
three months as the recent rise in virus cases weighed on global demand.

Services companies in China added to their staffing levels for the sixth
month running, but the rate of job creation eased further.

The rate of cost inflation quickened to the second-sharpest since April
2012. Meanwhile, prices charged by services companies increased at a
moderate pace that was the slowest seen for three months, the survey
showed.

Although [business][1] confidence regarding the 12-month outlook for
activity remained strong in January, the degree of positive sentiment
weakened since December.

The composite output index came in at 52.2 in January, down from 55.8 in
December, to signal only a moderate rise in overall output.

The rate of growth was the softest seen since the current period of
expansion began last May, driven by slower rises in both manufacturing
and services activity.
