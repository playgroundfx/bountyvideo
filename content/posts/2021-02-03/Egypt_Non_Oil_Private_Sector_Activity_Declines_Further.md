Egypt's non-oil private sector activity deteriorated at a softer pace in
January, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 48.7 in January from
48.2 in December. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the
sector.

In January, output fell as new work volumes decreased. Overall sales
eased due to the upturn in exports and improvement in the domestic
market.

Employment declined at the softest rate in the current fifteen-month
sequence. Backlogs of work dropped for the first time since April last
year.

Input purchase volume declined for the second straight month in January
and the rate of reduction was the sharpest in four years. Suppliers'
delivery time lengthened.

Purchasing cost increased at the quickest rate in three months in
January and the rise in average prices charged was the slowest since
August last year.

The outlook for the 12-month [business][1] activity improved to the
highest in six months in January on hopes of the Covid-19 vaccine roll-
out around the world.

"The downturn in the non-oil [economy][2] extended to a second
consecutive month in January, although the rate of decline softened from
December and was modest, particularly compared with the marked
contraction suffered during the global COVID-19 lockdown," IHS Markit
economist David Owen said.
