The private sector in Hong Kong continued to contract in January, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 47.8.

That's up sharply from 43.5 in December, although it remains beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Output and new orders both continued to fall at steep rates as virus
restrictions and social distancing dampened demand and curbed
[business][1] activity. Although rates of decline eased compared to
December, in both cases the downturns were the second-steepest since
August. Exports also fell sharply to add to the slump in domestic
demand.

Suppliers' delivery times in fact lengthened to the greatest extent
recorded since the survey began in 1998.
