The private sector in Singapore continued to expand in January, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday
with a PMI score of 52.9.

That's up from 50.5 in December, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Demand improved which panel members linked to promotional efforts,
client referrals and the easing of [coronavirus][1] disease 2019
(COVID-19) restrictions. New orders increased for the second month
running with the rate of growth the strongest since June 2018.

Export levels at the start of the year were broadly unchanged, however.
To cater for the growth in new orders, output rose at the sharpest rate
since April 2019.

Respondents noted a cut in workforce numbers at the start of the year
with voluntary resignations often cited. This extended the current
period of reduction to 17 months.
