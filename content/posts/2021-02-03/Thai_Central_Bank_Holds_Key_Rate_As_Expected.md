Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record
low on Wednesday as uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook
remained high.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank of Thailand unanimously decided to
retain the interest rate at 0.50 percent. The bank had reduced the rate
by 25 basis points in May 2020.

The committee reiterated that it stands ready to use additional
appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools if necessary.

The MPC expects the [economy][1] to expand somewhat lower than the
previous forecast. The bank noted that the recovery prospects remained
highly uncertain, which would in the short-term depends mainly on the
situation of the Covid-19 and containment measures.

Headline inflation was projected to return to the target in the middle
of 2021 and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range
throughout the forecast period, the bank said.

In addition to the weak economy, the other main concerns for the central
bank are the strong currency and persistent deflation, Gareth Leather,
an economist at Capital Economics, said. Both point in the direction of
interest rates remaining low for the foreseeable future.
