A report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday
showed U.S. service sector activity unexpectedly grew at an accelerated
rate in the month of January.

The ISM said its services PMI inched up to 58.7 in January from a
revised 57.7 in December, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in
the service sector.

The uptick came as surprise to economists, who had expected the index to
edge down to 56.8 from the 57.2 originally reported for the previous
month.

With the unexpected monthly increase, the services PMI reached its
highest level since hitting 58.8 in February of 2019.

"Services sector activity firmed at the start of 2021 despite the raging
pandemic and stricter virus containment measures," said Oren Klachkin,
Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

The increase by the headline index was partly due to a significant
acceleration in the pace of growth in new orders, as the new orders
index jumped to 61.8 in January from 58.6 in December.

The employment index also surged up to 55.2 in January from 48.7 in
December, indicating job growth in the service sector following a one-
month contraction.

On the other hand, the report said the [business][1] activity index
slipped to 59.9 in January from 60.5 in December, although the reading
above 50 still indicates the eighth straight month of growth.

The ISM said the prices index also edged down to 64.2 in January from
64.4 in December, pointing to a slight slowdown in the pace of price
growth.

"The stage is set for a strong rebound in the services sector heading
into the summer," said Klachkin. "The recent drop in new case rates is
encouraging and portends an improving [health][2] situation,
particularly with inoculations set to ramp up."

He added, "Improving health dynamics will allow deeply impacted services
sector businesses to gradually reopen, accelerating the recovery that
will also receive a booster shot from stimulus provided by the American
Rescue Plan."

Earlier this week, the ISM released a separate report showing a bigger
than expected slowdown in the pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing
activity in January.

The ISM said its manufacturing PMI declined to 58.7 in January from a
downwardly revised 60.5 in December, while economists had expected the
index to show a more modest drop to 60.0.
