Eurozone consumer prices increased for the first time in six months in
January largely due to temporary factors, flash data from Eurostat
showed on Thursday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices climbed 0.9 percent year-on-year
in January, reversing a 0.3 percent fall in December. Economists had
forecast an annual growth of 0.5 percent.

Prices increased for the first time since July, when the index was up
0.4 percent.

Excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, core inflation accelerated
more-than-expected to 1.4 percent from 0.2 percent. Economists had
forecast a rate of 0.5 percent.

Temporary factors are pushing up inflation at the moment, and there is
more to come, Bert Colijn, an ING economist, said. And that is exactly
why the European Central Bank should not be alarmed.

Headline inflation is likely to rise to around 2 percent by the end of
the year, but will drop back next year and, in the medium term, is
likely to remain well below the ECB's target, Andrew Kenningham, an
economist at Capital Economics, noted.

Data showed that the annual increase in food, alcohol and tobacco prices
rose to 1.5 percent from 1.3 percent. At the same time, energy prices
dropped at a slower pace of 4.1 percent after easing 6.9 percent.

Non-energy industrial goods prices climbed 1.4 percent, in contrast to
December's 0.5 percent fall. Services price cost growth increased to 1.4
percent from 0.7 percent.

EU harmonized prices turned positive in all four-major euro area
economies in January. Germany's prices grew 1.6 percent, reversing a 0.7
percent fall in December. France's inflation came in at 0.8 percent
versus zero a month ago.

Spain's prices climbed 0.6 percent annually, offsetting a 0.6 percent
fall a month ago. At the same time, Italy's HICP gained 0.5 percent,
reversing a 0.3 percent drop in December.

On a monthly basis, the euro area HICP gained 0.2 percent in January,
while core prices were down 0.5 percent in January.

Another report from Eurostat showed that producer prices continued to
decline in December. Producer prices fell 1.1 percent annually,
following a 1.9 percent drop in November.

Excluding energy, producer prices edged up 0.1 percent after staying
flat in November.

Month-on-month, producer price inflation doubled to 0.8 percent from 0.4
percent a month ago.

In 2020 as a whole, producer prices dropped 2.6 percent in the euro
area.
