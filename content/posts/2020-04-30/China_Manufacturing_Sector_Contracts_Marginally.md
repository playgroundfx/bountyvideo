China's manufacturing sector conditions weakened slightly in April as
the impact of the [coronavirus][1] globally led to a substantial fall in
export sales, survey results from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell unexpectedly to
49.4 in April from 50.1 in March. A score below 50 indicates contraction
in the sector. The score was expected to rise to 50.3.

Nonetheless, the decline was marginal and much softer than the record
pace seen in February when many firms closed down to stem the spread of
the virus.

Elsewhere, the official survey from the National Bureau of Statistics
showed that private sector expanded at a faster pace in April driven by
non-manufacturing activity. The composite output index rose to 53.4 from
53.0 in March.

The official factory PMI fell to 50.8 from 52.0 in March. Meanwhile, the
non-manufacturing PMI advanced to 53.2 from 52.3.

After a record fall in February, manufacturers signaled a back-to-back
rise in production, survey data from IHS Markit showed. Nonetheless, the
pace of expansion was marginal.

At the same time, new orders dropped for the third straight month due to
fall in foreign demand. Export orders slid at the fastest rate since
December 2008.

Due to fall in new work, firms reduced their staff again in April.
Meanwhile, backlog of work increased further as firms continued to
process orders from previous months.  
The weaker order book trend prompted firms to lower their purchasing
activity.

Consequently, firms used their current stocks leading to another fall in
inventories of input.

Average input costs decreased at the quickest rate in over four years in
April amid lower raw material prices. At the same time, output charges
declined as firms sought to remain competitive and attract sales.

Weighed down by concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, optimism
regarding the 12-month outlook for output dipped to a four-month low in
April.

Amid the second shockwave from the pandemic, the problems of low
[business][2] confidence, shrinking employment and large inventories of
industrial raw materials became more serious, Zhengsheng Zhong, chief
economist at CEBM Group said.

"A package of macroeconomic policies, as suggested in the April 17
Politburo meeting, must be implemented urgently," the economist said.
