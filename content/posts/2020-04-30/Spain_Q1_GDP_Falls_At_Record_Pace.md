Spain's [economy][1] contracted at the fastest pace on record in the
first quarter due to coronavirus, or covid-19, pandemic, data from the
statistical office INE showed Thursday.

Gross domestic product fell 5.2 percent from the fourth quarter, when it
was up 0.4 percent. The decline was the biggest on record and also
larger than the expected -4.4 percent.

On a yearly basis, the economy contracted 4.1 percent after expanding
1.8 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had forecast a 3.2 percent
decrease.

On the expenditure-side, final consumption expenditure fell 5.1 percent
and gross fixed capital formation decreased 5.8 percent. Exports and
imports were down 8.4 percent each in the first quarter.

Another flash report from INE showed that consumer prices declined the
most since mid-2016 in April due to the fall in oil prices.

Consumer prices fell 0.7 percent on a yearly basis in April after
staying flat a month ago. This was the fastest fall since June 2016,
when prices were down 0.8 percent.

Meanwhile, month-on-month, consumer prices gained 0.3 percent, in
contrast to a 0.4 percent drop in March.

Inflation, based on the harmonized index of consumer prices declined 0.6
percent on year, reversing a 0.1 percent rise in March. This was the
biggest drop since July 2016.

On a monthly basis, HICP inflation eased to 0.4 percent from 0.6
percent. Final data is due on May 14.
