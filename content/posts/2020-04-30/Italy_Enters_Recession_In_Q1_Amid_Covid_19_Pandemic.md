Italy entered a recession in the first quarter after the national output
contracted the most since the series began in 1995 due the
[coronavirus][1] lockdown, preliminary data from the statistical office
Istat showed Thursday.

Despite the lockdown, the unemployment rate declined unexpectedly in
March, data revealed.  
  
Gross domestic product fell 4.7 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, following a 0.3 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 2019.
However, economists had forecast a larger 5 percent contraction.

This was the biggest fall on record. The [economy][2] fell into a
recession as GDP contracted for two consecutive quarters.

On a yearly basis, GDP dropped 4.8 percent, in contrast to a 0.1 percent
rise in the previous quarter. GDP was expected to fall 5.1 percent.

Italy is one among the most affected economies from covid-19 pandemic.
The statistical office said lockdown has hampered the data collection.

Another report from Istat showed that the unemployment rate declined
unexpectedly in March. The jobless rate fell to 8.4 percent from revised
9.3 percent in February, while it was forecast to rise to 10.5 percent.

The unemployment rate among youth aged between 15 and 24, fell to 28
percent from 29.2 percent.

The number of unemployed persons decreased by 267,000 from the previous
month.

Preliminary data showed that consumer prices remained flat on a yearly
basis in April after rising 0.1 percent in March. The slowdown was
largely caused by energy prices.

Economists had forecast consumer prices to fall 0.2 percent on a yearly
basis.

Month-on-month, consumer prices gained 0.1 percent, confounding
expectations for a fall of 0.3 percent.

EU harmonized inflation remained unchanged at 0.1 percent in April. On a
monthly basis, the harmonized index of consumer prices advanced 0.5
percent.
