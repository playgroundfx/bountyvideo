The Bank of Japan will on Friday release the minutes from its emergency
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on March 16, highlighting a modest day for Asia-
Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the BoJ enhanced its massive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, in
addition to coordinated measures with other leading central banks, to
tackle the financial market downturn caused by the concerns over
[coronavirus][1] outbreak.

Japan also will see April results for the manufacturing PMI from Jibun
Bank, as well as Tokyo area inflation. In March, the PMI score was 44.8
and Tokyo inflation was up 0.4 percent both on month and on year.

Australia will see Q1 PPI figures and April numbers for the Performance
of Manufacturing Index from the Australian Industry Group. In the
previous three months, producer prices were up 0.3 percent on quarter
and 1.4 percent on year; in March, the index score was 53.7.

Finally, many of the regional [markets][2] are closed on Friday for the
Labor Day holiday, including South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.
