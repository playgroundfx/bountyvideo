The euro area [economy][1] contracted at the sharpest pace since the
series began in 1995 as member countries widely introduced coronavirus
containment measures, preliminary flash estimate from Eurostat showed
Thursday.

Gross domestic product fell 3.8 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, in contrast to a 0.1 percent rise in the fourth quarter of
2019. This was the biggest fall on record and larger than economists'
forecast of 3.2 percent.

On a yearly basis, the economy shrank 3.3 percent after rising 1 percent
in the fourth quarter. This was the sharpest drop since the third
quarter of 2009. GDP was forecast to gain 0.1 percent.

This historic drop in GDP will surely be followed by an even poorer
quarter given that most of the lockdown has taken place in April, Bert
Colijn, an ING economist, said.

That said, a cautious start to the recovery will happen in the same
quarter as lockdowns across the eurozone gradually get lifted, truly
making this a whirlwind of a recession, the economist added.

The EU27 GDP was down 3.5 percent on quarter and fell 2.7 percent on a
yearly basis in the first three months of 2020.

Another flash report from Eurostat revealed that inflation slowed in
April due to a sharp decline in energy prices.

Inflation slowed to 0.4 percent in April from 0.7 percent in March.
Nonetheless, this was above forecast of 0.1 percent. The fall in
inflation was largely driven by a 9.6 percent decrease in energy prices.

Headline inflation remains well below the European Central Bank's target
of "below, but close to 2 percent."

Core inflation that excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, slowed
marginally to 0.9 percent from 1 percent in the previous month.

On a monthly basis, the harmonized index of consumer prices gained 0.3
percent in April.

In a separate communiqu√©, Eurostat said the unemployment rate increased
in March. The jobless rate rose slightly to 7.4 percent in March from
7.3 percent in February. The rate was expected to climb to 7.7 percent.

The number of unemployed increased by 197,000 from the previous month to
12.156 million in March.

The youth unemployment rate advanced to 15.8 percent in March from 15.4
percent in February.
