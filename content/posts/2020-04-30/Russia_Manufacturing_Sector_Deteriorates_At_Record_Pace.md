Russia's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace on record
in April, amid decline in production and output expectations mainly due
to the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, outbreak, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Wednesday.

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 31.3 in
April from 47.5 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in
the sector.

This was the greatest deterioration since the survey began in September
1997.

New orders decreased at the fastest pace in the beginning of the second
quarter and total sales declined largely by challenging domestic and
foreign demand conditions due to coronavirus outbreak across Europe.

New export orders deteriorated at a record pace in April as clients
cancelled or postponed orders.

The imported input prices were higher in April as the ruble depreciated.
Cost burden increased sharply due to unfavorable exchange rates, with
the pace of inflation increasing to the fastest since the hike in VAT in
early-2019.

The degree of optimism towards the outlook over the next 12 months
decreased in April. Firms were least confident since the series began in
April 2012.

The firms cut their workforce at the quickest rate since January 2009
and the employment decreased sharply in April. The backlogs of work
declined at the strongest pace since December 2008.

"Already-difficult demand conditions across the Russia manufacturing
sector were further exacerbated by factory closures and lockdowns
following the escalation of the outbreak of COVID-19," Sian Jones,
Economist at IHS Markit, said.

"We expect industrial production in Russia to decline 3.8 percent in
2020, as the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak takes hold."
