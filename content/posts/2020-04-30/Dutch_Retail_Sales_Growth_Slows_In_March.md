Dutch retail sales grew at the softest pace in March, figures from the
Central Bureau of Statistics showed on Thursday.

Retail sales rose 3.5 percent year-on-year in March, after a 5.0 percent
increase in February. In January, retail sales grew 3.7 percent.

The measures against the spread of [coronavirus][1] disease had a large
effect on the retail, the agency said.

Sales of non-food decreased 8.0 percent in March, while prices of food
stores rose 12.2 percent.

Online sales gained 28.8 percent in March compared to the same month
last year.
