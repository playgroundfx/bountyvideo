The French [economy][1] contracted at the fastest pace on record in the
first quarter due to the containment measures taken to curb the spread
of coronavirus, preliminary data from the statistical office Insee
showed Thursday.

Gross domestic product fell 5.8 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, the biggest decline since the series began in 1949. Economists
had forecast a 3.5 percent fall after contracting marginally by 0.1
percent in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Two consecutive declines in GDP indicate that the economy has entered a
technical recession.

Earlier, the Bank of France had estimated a 6 percent fall in the first
quarter GDP.

GDP's negative evolution was primarily linked to the shut-down of "non-
essential" activities in the context of the implementation of the
lockdown since mid-March to contain the spread of [coronavirus][2], the
Insee said.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household consumption dropped
6.1 percent. Gross fixed capital formation declined 11.8 percent.
Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory changes fell sharply,
contributing -6.6 points to GDP growth.

At the same time, exports fell 6.5 percent and imports were down 5.9
percent. All in all, the foreign trade balance contributed negatively to
GDP growth by -0.2 points.

Conversely, changes in inventories contributed positively to GDP growth
by +0.9 points.

According to International Monetary Fund, France will shrink 7.2 percent
this year before expanding 4.5 percent in 2021.
