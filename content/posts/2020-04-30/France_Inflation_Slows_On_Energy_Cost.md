France's inflation slowed markedly in April reflecting a sharp fall in
energy prices and slowdown in services cost growth, preliminary estimate
from the statistical office Insee showed Thursday.

Another report showed that consumer spending declined at a record pace
in March as households curbed their consumption amid [coronavirus][1]
lockdown.

Consumer price inflation eased to 0.4 percent in April from 0.7 percent
in the previous month.

Food price growth accelerated to 3.7 percent, while the fall in energy
prices deepened to -8.5 percent. Services prices grew at a slower pace
of 0.7 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent in April, as
seen in the prior month.

Inflation, based on the harmonized index of consumer prices, came in at
0.5 percent versus 0.8 percent in March. The rate was forecast to fall
to 0.1 percent.

Month-on-month, the HICP was up 0.1 percent, the same rate as reported
in March.  
The Insee said the covid-19 impacts the quality of the April data as
collection on the field has been adjourned since March 16.

Another report showed that producer prices in the domestic market
declined 1.7 percent on month in March, following a 0.9 percent decrease
in February. Year-on-year, producer prices fell sharply by 2.7 percent
after easing 1.2 percent.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said household
consumption logged its biggest fall since the time series began in 1980.

Household spending plunged 17.9 percent on month in March, following a
0.5 percent decrease in February and a 1.2 percent fall in January.
Economists had forecast only 5.5 percent fall for March.

Spending on transport equipment decreased sharply by 60.4 percent and
that on energy dropped 11.4 percent.
