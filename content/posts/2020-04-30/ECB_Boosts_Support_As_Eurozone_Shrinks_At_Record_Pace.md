The European Central Bank strengthened its liquidity supportive measures
as the currency bloc contracted at the sharpest pace since 1995 as most
of the member states introduced [coronavirus][1] containment measures.

Following its scheduled meeting on Thursday, the Governing Council of
the ECB decided to ease the conditions on the targeted longer-term
refinancing operations, or TLTRO. The bank lowered the interest rate on
TLTRO operations to 50 basis points below the average interest rate.

In order to support liquidity conditions, a new series of non-targeted
pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations, or PELTRO, will
be conducted from May 2020.

Further, the ECB will continue its EUR 750 billion new pandemic
emergency purchase programme in a flexible manner over time, across
asset classes and among jurisdictions.

Moreover, net purchases under the asset purchase programme will continue
at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion, together with the purchases under
the additional EUR 120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the
year.

The council said it is fully prepared to increase the quantitative
easing.

The ECB left the key interest rate, which is the rate on the main
refinancing operations, at record low zero, as expected.

The deposit facility rate was kept at -0.50 percent. The marginal
lending facility rate was maintained at 0.25 percent.

Official data showed that the currency bloc contracted 3.8 percent
sequentially in the first quarter, in contrast to a 0.1 percent rise in
the fourth quarter of 2019. This was the biggest fall on record.

At the press conference in Frankfurt, ECB President Christine Lagarde
said the [economy][2] will contract as much as 12 percent this year. She
said the bloc is facing an economic contraction of magnitude and speed
that are unprecedented in peacetime.

Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said the decision to keep all
instruments and QE unchanged showed that it first wants to take stock of
all recent measures.

"It probably also wants to keep some powder dry. And, this dry powder is
needed, as today's GDP data has given us the first impression of how
severe the crisis in the eurozone actually is," Brzeski added.
