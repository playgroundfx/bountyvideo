Germany's retail sales declined at the fastest pace since 2007 in March
as most of the stores were closed to contain the spread of
[coronavirus][1], data from Destatis revealed Thursday.

Retail turnover fell by a real 5.6 percent on a monthly basis, in
contrast to a 0.8 percent rise in February.

This was the biggest fall since January 2007. However, sales were
forecast to decline more markedly by 7.3 percent.

Year-on-year, retail sales decreased 2.8 percent, confounding
expectations for a growth of 1.5 percent. Sales had increased 6.5
percent in February.

There was a strong demand for essential goods and medicines. Sale of
food, beverages and tobacco increased 8.9 percent annually, while non-
food sales declined 10.1 percent.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail turnover decreased 5.7 percent on month and was
down 1.5 percent from last year in March.
