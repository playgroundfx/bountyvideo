British car production declined in March as [coronavirus][1] pandemic
forced factories to close, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, or SMMT, reported Thursday.  
  
Car production declined 37.6 percent on a yearly basis in March. Only
78,767 vehicles left factory gates in March.

Output for the domestic market declined 36.8 percent, and that for
exports fell 37.8 percent.

Demand was particularly weak in major export destinations, including the
US and EU where many key [markets][2] were shut for the majority of the
month.

However, the lobby noted some encouraging signs with shipments to China
rising 2.3 percent as lockdown measures began to ease.

In the first quarter, overall auto production fell 13.8 percent to 319,
252 units.

Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said UK automotive is fundamentally
strong but, as these figures show, it is being tested like never before,
with each week of shutdown costing the sector and [economy][3] billions.

Government's emergency measures are helping keep many companies afloat
and thousands of people in jobs, but liquidity remains a major concern
and will become even more stretched as the industry begins to restart,
he noted.
