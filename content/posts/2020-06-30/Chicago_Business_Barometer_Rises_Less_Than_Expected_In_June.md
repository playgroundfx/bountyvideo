A report released by MNI Indicators on Tuesday showed a continued
contraction in Chicago-area [business][1] activity in the month of June.

MNI Indicators said its Chicago business barometer rose to 36.6 in June
from 32.3 in May, but a reading below 50 still indicates a contraction
in regional business activity. Economists had expected the index to jump
to 45.0.

The uptick by the Chicago business barometer reflected notable monthly
increases by the production and new orders indexes.

Meanwhile, the report said the employment index fell by 5.1 points in
June, remaining below 50 for the twelfth consecutive month.

The supplier deliveries index recorded the second curtailment in a row,
as firms continued to mention Covid-19 related delays.

On the inflation front, MNI Indicators said prices paid at the factory
gate rose 2.7 percent in June, with many companies noting the elevated
cost for air freight from Asia.
