Hong Kong's retail sales continued to fall for the sixteenth straight
month in May, figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed
on Tuesday.

The retail sales volume declined 33.9 percent year-on-year in May,
following a 37.5 percent decrease in April.

The value of retail sales decreased 32.8 percent annually in May,
following a 36.1 percent fall in the preceding month.

Sales value of jewelry, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts declined
69.7 percent annually in May. Sales of other consumer goods decreased
42.4 percent and those of clothing, footwear and allied products fell by
36.2 percent.

"Retail sales continued to fall sharply in May from a year earlier, as
inbound tourism remained at a standstill and job and income conditions
were weak," a government spokesman said.

The decline narrowed further from that in April thanks to the stabilized
local epidemic situation and consequential easing of social distancing
measures, the spokesman noted.

"The [business][1] environment for retail trade remains difficult amid
austere labor market conditions and the travel restrictions in place,"
the spokesman added.
