Bank of England Chief Economist Andrew Haldane said recent indicators
suggest that the economic recovery has been somewhat sooner and
materially faster than the bank assessed in May.

The alphabet that best describe the path of the [economy][1] is 'V'. "It
is early days, but my reading of the evidence is so far, so V", he said.

Haldane said risks to the economy remain considerable and two-sided.

In May, the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee observed that the balance of risks
to the outlook was skewed to the downside. However, Haldane said
subsequent positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on demand more than counterbalanced the rise in
downside risks to employment.

The banker observed that risks to the outlook are slightly more evenly
balanced than in May, if still with a downside skew.

At the June meeting, Haldane was the only member who voted against the
expansion of quantitative easing.

Haldane said the MPC is ready to adjust monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) if needed to
support the economy and bring inflation back to its target on a
sustainable basis.
