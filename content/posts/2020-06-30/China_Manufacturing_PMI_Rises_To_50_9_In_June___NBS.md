The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in June, and at a
slightly faster rate, the latest survey from the National Bureau of
Statistics showed on Tuesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 50.9.

That beat expectations for 50.4 and was up from 50.6 in May. It also
moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion
from contraction.

The bureau also noted that its non-manufacturing index came in with a
score of 54.4. That also beat expectations for 54.1 and was up from 53.6
in the previous month.
