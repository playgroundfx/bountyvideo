With prices for fuel imports continuing to skyrocket, the Labor
Department released a report on Thursday showing U.S. import prices
surged by more than expected in the month of March.

The report showed import prices spiked by 2.6 percent in March after
jumping by an upwardly revised 1.6 percent in February.

Economists had expected import prices to shoot up by 2.3 percent
compared to the 1.4 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Prices for fuel imports led the way higher, skyrocketing by 14.6 percent
in March after spiking by 10.0 percent in February.

However, prices for non-fuel imports still jumped by 1.2 percent in
March after climbing by 0.7 percent in February, reflecting higher
prices for non-fuel industrial supplies and materials, capital goods,
consumer goods, and foods, feeds, and beverages.

The report showed the annual rate of import price growth accelerated to
12.5 percent in March, reflecting the fastest growth since September
2011.

"We look for the deceleration in import price inflation to unfold
gradually over the course of 2022 as high consumer price inflation,
stronger services spending, and the normalization of monetary and fiscal
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) work to restrain robust goods demand," said Mahir Rasheed, U.S.
Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "However, risks remain tilted to the upside given uncertainty
over the path ahead for energy prices and insufficient progress on the
production front, especially as pandemic woes in China threaten to
reaggravate supply stress."

The Labor Department said export prices also soared by 4.5 percent in
March after spiking by 3.0 percent in February. Export prices were
expected to jump by 2.2 percent.

The bigger than expected surge came as prices for agricultural exports
and non-agricultural exports shot up by 4.7 percent and 4.5 percent,
respectively.

Compared to the same month a year ago, export prices in March were up by
18.8 percent, reflecting the biggest annual increase since 12-month
percent changes were first published in September 1984.
