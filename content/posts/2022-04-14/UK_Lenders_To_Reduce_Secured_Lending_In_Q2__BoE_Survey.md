The UK lenders intended to reduce providing secured credit to households
in the three months to May, despite an expected increase in demand for
mortgage lending, the survey results from the Bank of England showed on
Thursday.

According to Credit Conditions Survey, lenders maintained the
availability of secured credit to households in three months to
February. However, they plan to reduce the secured credit in the second
quarter.

The supply of unsecured credit to households increased in the first
quarter and was expected to rise further in the quarter ahead.

The survey showed that the supply of credit to the corporate sector was
unchanged in the first quarter and banks plan to retain its flow in the
second quarter.

The credit conditions survey points to credit availability being
restricted by higher market interest rates which will be priced into
mortgage rates in the second quarter, Andrew Wishart and Pieter du
Preez, economists at Capital Economics, said.

Despite other lending criteria remaining stable or even loosened
somewhat, that should weigh on buyer demand and bring down house price
growth sharply in the second half of the year, they said.

Further, demand for secured lending for house purchases rose slightly in
the first quarter and it will rise again, lenders said.  
  
Likewise, demand for unsecured lending is expected to rise in the second
quarter as seen in the first quarter.

Lenders reported that overall demand for corporate lending from
businesses of all sizes was unchanged in the first quarter but will
increase in the second quarter.

As the survey was conducted between February 28 and March 18, any impact
from the recent developments is not captured.
