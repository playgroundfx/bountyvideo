Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for the third
straight time, as global inflationary pressures and tight labor market
continued to exert upward pressure on inflation.  
  
The Monetary Authority of Singapore, on Thursday, decided to re-centre
the mid-point of the exchange rate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) band at the prevailing level
of the S$NEER.

The MAS will also increase slightly the rate of appreciation of the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) band to exert a continuing dampening effect on inflation. There
was no change to the width of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) band or the level at which it
was centred.

"This off-cycle move was assessed to be necessary in view of the upward
revision to the [MAS Core Inflation][1] forecast amid rapidly
accumulating external and domestic cost pressures," the bank said.

This was the third [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) adjustment after taking such actions in
October and January.

The MAS applies the exchange rate against a basket of currencies within
an undisclosed band as its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tool.

The bank raised its core inflation forecast to 2.5-3.5 percent this
year, from the 2.0-3.0 percent expected in January. Likewise, the
overall inflation outlook was lifted to 4.5-5.5 percent from the earlier
range of 2.5-3.5 percent.

In the absence of further disruptions caused by the Ukraine war or a
severe setback in the trajectory of the pandemic, the bank said the
city-state [economy][2] will grow 3-5 percent this year.

Elsewhere, data released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed
that the [economic growth][3] eased to 3.4 percent in the first quarter
from 6.1 percent in the preceding period.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, gross domestic
product climbed 0.4 percent, slower than the 2.3 percent growth
registered in the previous quarter.
