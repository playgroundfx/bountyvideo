Partly reflecting a spike in sales by gas stations, the Commerce
Department released a report on Thursday showing an increase in U.S.
retail sales in the month of March.

The report showed retail sales rose by 0.5 percent in March after
climbing by an upwardly revised 0.8 percent in February.

Economists had expected retail sales to increase by 0.6 percent compared
to the 0.3 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding a pullback in sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail
sales jumped by 1.1 percent in March after rising by 0.6 percent in
February. Ex-auto sales were expected to increase by 1.0 percent.
