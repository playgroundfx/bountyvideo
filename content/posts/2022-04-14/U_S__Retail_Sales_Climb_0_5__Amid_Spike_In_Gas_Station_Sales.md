Reflecting a spike in sales by gas stations, the Commerce Department
released a report on Thursday showing an increase in U.S. retail sales
in the month of March.

The report showed retail sales rose by 0.5 percent in March after
climbing by an upwardly revised 0.8 percent in February.

Economists had expected retail sales to increase by 0.6 percent compared
to the 0.3 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month.

The retail sales growth came as sales by gas stations skyrocketed by 8.9
percent amid the recent surge in gasoline prices. Excluding the spike in
gas station sales, retail sales dipped by 0.3 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers
slumped by 1.9 percent in March after jumping by 1.5 percent in
February.

Excluding the pullback in auto sales, retail sales jumped by 1.1 percent
in March after rising by 0.6 percent in February. Ex-auto sales were
expected to increase by 1.0 percent.

Along with the spike in sales by gas stations, the ex-auto sales growth
reflected notably higher sales by general merchandise stores, sporting
goods, hobby, musical instrument, and book stores, electronics and
appliance stores and clothing and accessories stores.

On the other hand, the report showed sales by non-store retailers
plunged by 6.4 percent in March after tumbling by 3.5 percent in
February.

Closely watched core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline,
building materials and food services, edged down by 0.1 percent in March
after falling by 0.9 percent in February.

"The surge in consumer prices means that consumption fell again last
month in real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), by 0.2% or so," said Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S.
Economist at Capital Economics. "While that would still leave growth
over the first-quarter as a whole at close to 3.5% annualized, it
provides a weak starting point for the second quarter."

He added, "More generally, although the energy price-related hit to real
incomes may unwind over the coming months, we expect slowing employment
growth to keep consumption growth relatively subdued."
