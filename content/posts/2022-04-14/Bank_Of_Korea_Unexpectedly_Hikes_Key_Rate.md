South Korea's central bank unexpectedly lifted its key interest rate on
Thursday, as inflation is expected to remain high for some time.

The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided to hike the Base
Rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 percent from 1.25 percent.

The bank had raised its key rate by 25 basis points each in November and
January.

The board said it will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation as the Korean [economy][1] is expected to continue
its recovery and inflation to run above the target level for a
considerable time.

According to central bank assessment, the economy will sustain its
recovery albeit partly affected by the Ukraine crisis. Despite supply
chain issues, exports are set to continue to log solid growth trend and
[private consumption][2] is forecast to improve.  
  
Nonetheless, GDP growth is projected to be somewhat below the February
forecast of 3 percent.

Looking ahead, [consumer price inflation][3] is expected to remain high
in the 4 percent range for some time, and run substantially above the
February forecast of 3.1 percent for the year overall. Core inflation is
seen around 3 percent for a considerable time.
