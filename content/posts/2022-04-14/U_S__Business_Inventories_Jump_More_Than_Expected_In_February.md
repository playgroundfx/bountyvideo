A report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed a
continued surge in U.S. [business][1] inventories in the month of
February.

The Commerce Department said business inventories shot up by 1.5 percent
in February following an upwardly revised 1.3 percent jump in January.

Economists had expected business inventories to increase by 1.3 percent
compared to the 1.1 percent advance originally reported for the previous
month.

Wholesale inventories led the way higher, spiking by 2.5 percent, while
retail inventories jumped by 1.2 percent and manufacturing inventories
rose by 0.6 percent.

The report showed business sales also increased by 1.0 percent in
February after soaring by 4.1 percent in January.

Wholesale sales shot up by 1.7 percent, while manufacturing and retail
sales climbed by 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.

With inventories increasing by more than sales, the total business
inventories/sales ratio ticked up to 1.26 in February from 1.25 in
January.
