Preliminary data released by the University of Michigan on Thursday
unexpectedly showed a substantial improvement in U.S. consumer sentiment
in the month of April.

The report showed the consumer sentiment index spiked to 65.7 in April
from 59.4 in March. The sharp increase surprised economists, who had
expected the index to edge down to 59.0.

The consumer sentiment index rebounded from its lowest level since
August 2011 amid an improvement in consumer expectations, with the
expectations index surging to 64.1 in April from 54.3 in Mach.

"Consumers still anticipate that the national unemployment rate will
inch downward, acting to improve consumers' outlook for the national
[economy][1]," said Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin.

He added, "Perhaps the most surprising change was that consumers
anticipated a year-ahead increase in gas prices of just 0.4 cents in
April, completely reversing March's surge to 49.6 cents."

The report also showed the current economic conditions index inched up
to 68.1 in April from 67.2 in the previous month.

"Nonetheless, the April survey offers only tentative evidence of small
gains in sentiment, which is still too close to recession lows to be
reassuring," Curtin said.

He added, "There are still significant sources of economic uncertainty
that could easily reverse the April gains, including the impact on the
domestic economy from Putin's war, and the potential impact of new covid
variants."

On the inflation front, one-year and five-year inflation expectations
were unchanged at 5.4 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively.
