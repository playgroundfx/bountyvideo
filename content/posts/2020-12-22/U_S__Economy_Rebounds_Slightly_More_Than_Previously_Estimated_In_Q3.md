Revised data released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the
U.S. [economy][1] rebounded by slightly more than previously estimated
in the third quarter of 2020.

The report showed the spike in gross domestic product in the third
quarter was upwardly revised to 33.4 percent from the previously
reported 33.1 percent. Economists had expected the jump in GDP to be
unrevised.

The Commerce Department said the unexpected upward revision primarily
reflected larger increases in consumer spending and non-residential
fixed investment.

The substantial increase in GDP in the third quarter came following a
record contraction in the second quarter, when GDP plunged by 31.4
percent.

A measure of an industry's contribution to GDP showed private goods-
producing industries increased 47.2 percent, private services-producing
industries increased 35.1 percent, and government increased 10.1
percent.

"The leading contributors to gains were manufacturing, healthcare,
accommodation and food services, retail trade, and wholesale trade,"
said Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

However, he added, "The recovery remains far from complete, with output
sill below pre-Covid levels across several industry groups."

On the inflation front, the report said core consumer prices, which
exclude food and energy prices, were up 1.4 percent year-over-year in
the third quarter, reflecting an acceleration from the 1.0 percent
increase in the second quarter.

The annual rate of core consumer price growth remains well below the
Federal Reserve's 2.0 percent target, which the central bank has said it
wants to moderately exceed for some time before considering raising
interest rates.

"As we gaze into 2021, the outlook will be one of contrasts," Daco said.
"The economy will start the year gingerly, and it'll be prone to hiccups
during the delicate vaccine diffusion phase."

"But, as the cocktail of increased government transfers and broad-based
vaccinations takes shape, we should expect gradually firming activity
leading to a mini-summer boom," he added. "We anticipate real GDP growth
around 4.5% on average in 2021 after a 3.4% contraction in 2020."
