After reporting sharp increases in U.S. existing home sales for five
consecutive months, the National Association of Realtors released a
report on Tuesday showing existing home sales pulled back in the month
of November.

NAR said existing home sales tumbled by 2.5 percent to an annual rate of
6.69 million in November after jumping by 4.4 percent to a revised rate
of 6.86 million in October.

Economists had expected existing home sales to slump by 2.2 percent to a
rate of 6.70 million from the 6.85 million originally reported for the
previous month.

"Home sales in November took a marginal step back, but sales for all of
2020 are already on pace to surpass last year's levels," said NAR chief
economist Lawrence Yun. "Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it's amazing that
the housing sector is outperforming expectations."

Despite the monthly decrease, existing home sales in November were up by
25.8 percent compared to the same month a year ago.

The report said the median existing home price for all housing types was
$310,800 in November, down 0.7 percent from $313.100 in October but up
14.6 percent from $271,300 in November of 2019.

Housing inventory totaled 1.28 million units at the end of November,
down 9.9 percent from 1.42 million at the end of October and down 22.0
percent from 1.64 million a year ago.

The unsold inventory represents an all-time low of 2.3 months of supply
at the current sales pace, down from 2.5 months in October and down from
3.7 months in November of 2019.

NAR also said single-family home sales slumped by 2.4 percent to a rate
of 5.98 million, while existing condominium and co-cop sales tumbled by
2.7 percent to 710,000.

"Circumstances are far from being back to the pre-pandemic normal," Yun
said. "However, the latest stimulus package and with the vaccine
distribution underway, and a very strong demand for homeownership still
prevalent, robust growth is forthcoming for 2021."

On Wednesday, the Commerce Department is schedule to release a separate
report on new home sales in the month of November.

Economists expect new home sales to dip by 0.3 percent in November,
matching the modest decrease seen in October.
