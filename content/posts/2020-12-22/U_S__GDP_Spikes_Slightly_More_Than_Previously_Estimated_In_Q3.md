Revised data released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the
U.S. [economy][1] grew by slightly more than previously estimated in the
third quarter of 2020.

The report showed the spike in gross domestic product in the third
quarter was upwardly revised to 33.4 percent from the previously
reported 33.1 percent. Economists had expected the jump in GDP to be
unrevised.

The Commerce Department said the unexpected upward revision primarily
reflected larger increases in consumer spending and non-residential
fixed investment.

The substantial increase in GDP in the third quarter came following a
record contraction in the second quarter, when GDP plunged by 31.4
percent.
