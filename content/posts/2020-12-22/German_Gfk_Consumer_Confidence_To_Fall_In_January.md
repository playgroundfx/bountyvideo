German consumer confidence is set to fall in January due to the severe
lockdown measures introduced to withstand the second wave of Covid-19
infections, survey results from the market research group GfK showed
Tuesday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index fell to -7.3 in January
from -6.8 in December. The score was forecast to drop to -8.8.

"Currently, the savings indicator is primarily responsible for the third
decline in a row in the consumer climate," Rolf BÃ¼rkl, GfK consumer
expert said. "With the hard lockdown and the closing of most stores, the
consumer climate has to cope with another setback."

Among sub-components of the consumer climate index, economic
expectations and propensity to buy gained from November, while income
expectations deteriorated in December.

After two straight declines, the economic expectations index rose 4.6
points to 4.4 in December.

In contrast to the economic expectations, the income expectations
declined in December. The indicator slipped to 3.6 points from 4.6 a
month ago. Meanwhile, the propensity to buy index gained 6.1 points to
36.6 in December.
