Japan will on Monday see preliminary Q2 figures for gross domestic
product, setting the pace for a busy day in Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

GDP is expected to rise 0.2 percent on quarter and 0.7 percent on year
after sinking 1.0 percent on quarter and 3.9 percent on year in the
three months prior. Capital expenditure is tipped to climb 1.7 percent
on quarter after falling 1.2 percent in the previous three months.

Japan also will see final June figures for industrial production; in
May, output was down 6.5 percent on month and up 21.1 percent on year.

China will provide July figures for industrial production, retail sales,
fixed asset investment and unemployment.

Industrial production is tipped to gain 7.8 percent on year, down from
8.3 percent in June. Retail sales are called higher by an annual 11.5
percent, down from 12.1 percent in the previous month. FAI is expected
to advance 11.3 percent on year, down from 12.6 percent a month earlier.
The jobless rate in June was 5.0 percent.

Thailand will release Q2 numbers for gross domestic product, with
forecasts suggesting a decline of 1.4 percent on quarter and an increase
of 6.4 percent on year. That follows the 0.2 percent quarterly increase
and the 2.6 percent annual decline in the previous three months.

New Zealand will see July results for the Performance of Services Index
