Denmark's jobless rate declined marginally in December, figures from
Statistics Denmark showed on Friday.

The gross unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.4 percent in
December from 4.5 percent in November.

The gross unemployment declined for the seventh month in a row in
December, mainly due to the Covid-19 closure in mid-March, the agency
said.

The gross unemployment fell by 2,000 to 125,600 in December from 127,600
in the preceding month.

The youth jobless rate, which is applicable to the 16 to 24 age group,
fell to 1.8 percent in December from 1.9 percent in the previous month.

Based on the LFS data, the jobless rate was 5.8 percent in the 15 to 74
age group. The number of unemployed persons was 177,000 in December.
