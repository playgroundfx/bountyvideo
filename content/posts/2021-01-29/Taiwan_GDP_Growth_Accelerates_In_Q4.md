Taiwan's [economy][1] grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter driven
by robust foreign demand for electronic products, advance estimate from
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting & Statistics showed
Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 4.94 percent year-on-year in the fourth
quarter, faster than the 3.92 percent expansion in the third quarter.
Economists had forecast the annual growth to ease to 3.61 percent.

Private consumption fell 1.1 percent, while government spending advanced
4.77 percent in the fourth quarter. Gross capital formation decreased
1.4 percent.

Driven by the strong foreign demand for parts of electronic products, as
well as information, communication and audio-video products, exports
logged a robust growth of 5.65 percent. On the other hand, imports were
down 2.77 percent.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualized basis, GDP
expanded 7.77 percent. However, this was much weaker than the 16.59
percent growth logged in the third quarter.

In the whole year of 2020, GDP expanded 2.98 percent versus 2.96 percent
in 2019.
