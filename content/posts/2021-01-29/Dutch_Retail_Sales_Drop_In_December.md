Dutch retail sales declined for the first time in eight months in
December due to the closure of non-food stores, data published by the
Central Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.

Retail turnover dropped 3.1 percent year-on-yearly in December,
following a 10.3 percent growth in November.

The Cabinet announced a strict lockdown on 14 December 2020 to prevent
[coronavirus][1] infection, the agency said.

Turnover in non-food stores contracted 22.6 percent in December, while
food stores grew 9.3 percent each from the previous year. Online
turnover surged 58.3 percent.

In 2020, retail turnover posted its second highest growth of 5.9
percent, following a 3.3 percent rise in 2019. Turnover grew the most on
record in 2001, when it was up by 6.0 percent.
