Austria's producer prices declined at a softer pace in December, figures
from Statistics Austria showed on Thursday.

The producer price index decreased 1.0 percent year-on-year in December,
following a 1.4 percent fall in November.

The decline in producer prices was mainly driven by a fall in energy
prices and intermediate goods by 3.8 percent and 0.7 percent,
respectively.

Meanwhile, prices for capital goods rose 0.6 percent and consumer goods
remained unchanged in December.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.4 percent in December,
following a 0.3 percent increase in the preceding month.

In 2020, producer prices declined to 1.6 percent.

In the fourth quarter, producer prices fell 1.3 percent annually and
rose 0.6 percent quarterly.
