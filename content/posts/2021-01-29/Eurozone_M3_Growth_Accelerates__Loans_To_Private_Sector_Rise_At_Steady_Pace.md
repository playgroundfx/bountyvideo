Eurozone money supply grew at a faster pace in December and adjusted
loans to the private sector logged a steady growth, the European Central
Bank reported Friday.

The broad measure M3 expanded 12.3 percent annually, which was faster
than the 11 percent growth in November and economists' forecast of 11.2
percent.

Similarly, M1 growth improved to 15.6 percent in December from 14.5
percent a month ago.

As regards the dynamics of credit, data showed that credit to euro area
residents rose 9.6 percent and that to general government surged 22.2
percent in December.  
Annual growth in credit to the private sector increased to 5.3 percent
from 5 percent in the previous month.

Data showed that the annual growth rate of adjusted loans to the private
sector held steady at 4.7 percent in December.

Among the borrowing sectors, adjusted loans to households increased 3.1
percent, unchanged from the previous month, while the annual growth rate
of adjusted loans to non-financial corporations climbed to 7.0 percent
from 6.9 percent a month ago.

While lending to non-financial corporations marginally increased in
December, it came nowhere close to the volumes seen in March, April and
May, Bert Colijn, an ING economist, said. The economic outlook is simply
too uncertain for businesses to borrow for large investments at the
moment, the economist added.
