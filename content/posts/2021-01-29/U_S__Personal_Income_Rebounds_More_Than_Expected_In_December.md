While the Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing a much
bigger than expected increase in U.S. personal income in the month of
December, the report also showed a modest decrease in personal spending.

The report said personal income climbed by 0.6 percent in December after
tumbling by a downwardly revised 1.3 percent in November.

Economists had expected personal income to inch up by 0.1 percent
compared to the 1.1 percent slump originally reported for the previous
month.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said personal spending dipped by 0.2
percent in December after falling by a downwardly revised 0.7 percent in
November.

Economists had expected spending to decrease by 0.4 percent, matching
the drop originally reported for the previous month.
