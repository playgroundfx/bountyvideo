While the Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing a much
bigger than expected increase in U.S. personal income in the month of
December, the report also showed a modest decrease in personal spending.

The report said personal income climbed by 0.6 percent in December after
tumbling by a downwardly revised 1.3 percent in November.

Economists had expected personal income to inch up by 0.1 percent
compared to the 1.1 percent slump originally reported for the previous
month.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, also increased by 0.6 percent in December after plunging by 1.5
percent in November.

The Commerce Department said the growth in personal income primarily
reflected increases in government social benefits, compensation, and
personal dividend income

Meanwhile, the report said personal spending dipped by 0.2 percent in
December after falling by a downwardly revised 0.7 percent in November.

Economists had expected spending to decrease by 0.4 percent, matching
the drop originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding price changes, personal spending showed a more substantial 0.6
percent decrease in December following a 0.7 percent decline in
November.

With income rising and spending falling, personal saving as a percentage
of disposable income jumped to 13.7 percent in December from 12.9
percent in November.

Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics, estimates U.S.
households have accumulated $1.6 trillion in savings since the onset of
the Covid crisis.

"This initially reflected savings from fiscal transfers in the CARES Act
- checks to families and expanded jobless benefits," said Daco. "Now
they entirely reflect higher-income families' lack of opportunity to
spend on services amid steady finances."

He added, "The top two income quintiles now own all of the accumulated
cash stash, while the bottom three have been dissaving."

A reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal Reserve
showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth ticked up to 1.5
percent in December from 1.4 percent in November.
