Spain's [economy][1] logged an unexpected growth in the fourth quarter,
preliminary data from the statistical office INE revealed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent sequentially, confounding
expectations for a decline of 1.5 percent. However, growth was much
slower than the 16.4 percent increase posted in the third quarter.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household spending growth
eased to 2.5 percent from 20.8 percent. Meanwhile, government spending
rose 4 percent, faster than the 1.2 percent increase seen a quarter ago.

Gross capital formation declined 6.2 percent, following a 20.4 percent
rise. Exports slid 1.4 percent, while imports advanced 0.4 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP fell 9.1 percent versus a 9 percent decrease in
the third quarter and -21.6 percent in the second quarter.

In the whole year of 2020, GDP decreased 11 percent, in contrast to 2
percent rise in 2019.
