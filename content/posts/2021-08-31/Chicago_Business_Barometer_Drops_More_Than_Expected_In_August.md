MNI Indicators released a report on Tuesday showing a significant
slowdown in the pace of growth in Chicago-area [business][1] activity.

The report showed MNI Indicators' Chicago business barometer slumped to
66.8 in August from 73.4 in July, although a reading above 50 still
indicates growth. Economists had expected the index to drop to 68.0.

The slowdown in the pace of growth came as firms said the available
supply of raw materials and workers isn't sufficient to keep up with new
orders.

The order backlogs index surged up 11.6 points to 81.6, the highest
reading since 1951, as firms reported a shortage of materials, freight
inconsistencies, and insufficient staff.

Meanwhile, the report said the production index tumbled by 7.8 points to
61.0, while the new orders index slid 4.4 points to 67.8.

The prices paid index increased 2.3 points to 93.9, hitting the highest
level since 1979, as companies continued to report higher costs for
production materials.
