India's [economy][1] logged a record growth in the three months to June,
but that came from an extremely low base in the same period last year
when the coronavirus pandemic and resultant lockdowns hurt economic
activity severely.

Gross domestic product grew 20.1 percent year-on-year in the April to
June quarter versus a 24.4 percent contraction in the same period of the
fiscal year 2020-21, preliminary estimates from the statistics ministry
showed Tuesday. Economists had forecast 20 percent growth.  
  
The quarterly gross value added rose 18.8 percent year-on-year versus a
22.4 percent drop in the same quarter last year.

Among the main sectors, the gross value added in the agriculture,
forestry and fishing sector grew 4.5 percent. The sector was the only
one to log growth, 3.5 percent, in the same quarter last year despite
the pandemic.  
  
The construction sector registered the biggest growth of 68.3 percent in
value added, followed by manufacturing with an increase of 49.6 percent.  
  
Value added in the sector that includes trade, hospitality, transport
and communication grew 34.3 percent. Growth was modest at 3.7 percent in
the sector that includes financial and real estate services.  
  
As the annual growth figure is almost entirely boosted by the low base
in the year-ago period, economists drew attention to the quarter-on-
quarter change in GDP that the statistical office does not provide.  
  
Citing its own calculation, Capital Economics said the Indian economy
contracted by 12 percent seasonally-adjusted [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) in the June quarter
amid the ferocious second virus wave and reintroduction of containment
measures.

Despite a rebound in activity in recent times as the second wave
subsided rather quickly, the recovery is fragile, Capital Economics
economist Shilan Shah said.  
  
"Above all, with vaccination coverage still very low and the rollout
struggling to build momentum, there remains a risk of renewed virus
outbreaks, which would force authorities to tighten restrictions again,"
Shah said.  
  
That could further damage the heavily impaired banking sector, the
economist said.

"Under these circumstances, the RBI won't be in any rush to withdraw
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support," Shah added.

The central bank has projected 9.5 percent growth for the current
financial year ending March 2022.
