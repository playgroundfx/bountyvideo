Portugal's economic growth improved at the same pace as initially
estimated, latest data from Statistics Portugal confirmed Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 4.9 percent from the first quarter, when it
shrunk 3.2 percent.

Quarterly growth was largely driven by the 5.4 percentage points
positive contribution of domestic demand to GDP, after being negative in
the first quarter, the statistical office said. A less negative net
external demand contribution in the second quarter also underpinned
growth.  
  
Year-on-year, GDP rose 15.5 percent in the second quarter after a 5.3
percent fall in the previous quarter. The increase was the first since
the fourth quarter of 2019.

The double-digit annual growth figure was largely due to a base effect
as activity was severely hurt by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic in the
same period last year.
