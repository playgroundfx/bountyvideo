France consumer prices grew at the fastest pace in nearly three years in
August largely driven by the rebound in manufactured goods prices linked
to the end of summer sales, the provisional estimate from the
statistical office Insee showed on Tuesday.

Consumer price inflation rose more-than-expected to 1.9 percent in
August from 1.2 percent in July. Economists had forecast the inflation
rate to rise to 1.7 percent.  
  
This was the highest since October 2018, when the price growth was 2.2
percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.6 percent in August versus
a 0.1 percent rise in the previous month. Prices were forecast to climb
0.4 percent.

EU harmonized inflation advanced to 2.4 percent from 1.5 percent in the
previous month. This was also above economists' forecast of 2.1 percent.
Final data is due on September 15.

Month-on-month, the harmonized index of consumer prices climbed at a
faster pace of 0.7 percent after rising 0.1 percent in July. The HICP
was expected to rise 0.5 percent.

Manufactured product prices rebounded 1.3 percent and energy prices
advanced 12.7 percent annually. Food prices increased 1.2 percent and
services costs gained 0.7 percent.

Another report from the Insee showed that domestic producer price
inflation accelerated to 8.6 percent in July from 7.6 percent a month
ago. On month, the producer price index rose 1.3 percent after climbing
1.1 percent in June.
