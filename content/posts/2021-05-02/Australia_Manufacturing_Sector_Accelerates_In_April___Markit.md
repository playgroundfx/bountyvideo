The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in April, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Monday with a survey record manufacturing PMI score of 59.7.

That's up from 56.8 in March and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New order growth was at a fresh survey high, with output rising at a
pace only just shy of the record seen in December 2016. Recovery from
COVID-19 lockdowns and government support reportedly supported the
growth in demand, while renewed orders from existing customers had also
helped to boost workloads.

Suppliers' delivery times continued to lengthen at a severe rate in
April, although the instances of delays moderated slightly and were the
least pronounced since July last year. Supply chain constraints coupled
with the increase in demand led to the sharpest rise in backlogs of work
since December 2017.
