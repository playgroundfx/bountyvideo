Indonesia's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged on
Thursday, citing a subdued inflation outlook and expectations of a
sustained economic recovery.  
  
The board of governors decided to hold the the BI 7-Day reverse repo
rate at 3.50 percent, the Bank Indonesia said in a statement. That was
in line with economists' expectations.

The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in
February.

The deposit facility rate was maintained at 2.75 percent and lending
facility rates at 4.25 percent.

The bank said the decision was consistent with projected low inflation
and efforts to maintain Rupiah exchange rate stability, while boosting
the economic recovery.

"Moving forward, a stronger global [economy][1], faster vaccination
rollout and closer [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) synergy will drive the domestic economic
recovery despite the recent uptick in Covid-19 cases reported at the end
of the second quarter," the bank said.

"Consequently, economic growth in 2021 remains in line with Bank
Indonesia's April 2021 projection of 4.1-5.1 percent."

The central bank projected "a low and manageable" current account
deficit for this year at approximately 1.0-2.0 percent of GDP.

The bank said it will continue to strengthen exchange rate stabilization

through effective monetary operations and adequate market liquidity.
