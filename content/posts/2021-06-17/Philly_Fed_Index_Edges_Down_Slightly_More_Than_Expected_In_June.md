Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity expanded at a slightly slower
rate in the month of June, according to a report released by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current general activity
slipped to 30.7 in June from 31.5 in May, although a positive reading
still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists
had expected the index to edge down to 31.0.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said most future indicators improved,
suggesting that more firms expect overall growth over the next six
months.
