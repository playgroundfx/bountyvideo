Norway's central bank signaled an interest rate hike in September as the
economic activity rebounded at a faster than expected pace and inflation
remained below the target.  
  
The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee of Norges Bank
unanimously decided to hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at zero percent.

In the Committee's current assessment of the outlook and balance of
risks, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised in September,"
Governor Ã˜ystein Olsen, said.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate path implies a gradual rate increase from autumn,
followed by a further rise in the coming years to just above 1.5 percent
in the course of 2024.

A normalization of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate reflects a return of economic
activity to a normal level.

Further easing of Covid-related restrictions will help a return to more
normal economic conditions, the bank said. This suggests that it will
soon be appropriate to raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate from the current level.

Although there is still uncertainty regarding the evolution of the
pandemic, economic activity seems to be rebounding sharply and somewhat
faster than projected earlier, Olsen noted.

Economic growth is expected to rebound strongly through summer, and
mainland GDP is projected to increase 0.8 percent in the second quarter
of 2021 and 3.2 percent in the third quarter. Annual growth in mainland
GDP is projected at 3.8 percent this year.

Activity in the mainland [economy][1] will then have returned to its
pre-pandemic level in the third quarter, the bank said.

On price front, the bank observed that the krone appreciation since 2020
and prospects for moderate wage growth suggest that inflation in Norway
will remain below target in the coming years.

As long as capacity utilization is rising, there is limited risk of
inflation becoming too low, the bank said.
