Europe's passenger car registrations increased sharply in May, the
European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, said on
Thursday.

Passenger car sales advanced 53.4 percent year-on-year in May, after
expanding 218.6 percent in April due to the low base of comparison.
Sales totaled 891,665 units.  
  
In volume [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), Spain posted the biggest increase of 177.8 percent in
May. The EU's three other key car [markets][1] also did well in May.
Sales in France grew 46.4 percent and by 43 percent in Italy. Germany's
car registrations were up 37.2 percent.

During January to May period, EU demand for new cars increased 29.5
percent to reach 4.3 million units. The steep declines in the first two
months of 2021 were counterbalanced by rises in March, April and May.
