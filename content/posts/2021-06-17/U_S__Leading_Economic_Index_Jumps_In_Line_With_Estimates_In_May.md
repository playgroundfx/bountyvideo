Suggesting strong economic growth will continue in the near term, the
Conference Board released a report on Thursday showing another
significant increase by its index of leading U.S. economic indicators.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index surged up by 1.3
percent in May, matching the revised jump in April as well as economist
estimates. The matching increases follow a 1.4 percent spike in March.

Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The
Conference Board, said the leading economic index now stands above the
previous peak reached in January 2020.

"Strengths among the leading indicators were widespread, with initial
claims for unemployment insurance making the largest positive
contribution to the index; housing permits made this month's only
negative contribution," Ozyildirim said.

He added, "The Conference Board now forecasts real GDP growth in Q2
could reach 9 percent (annualized), with year-over-year economic growth
reaching 6.6 percent for 2021."

The report said the coincident economic index climbed by 0.4 percent in
May after rising by 0.3 percent in April and jumping by 1.3 percent in
March.

Meanwhile, the lagging economic index tumbled by 2.2 percent in May
after soaring by 3.0 percent in April and plunging by 4.2 percent in
March.
