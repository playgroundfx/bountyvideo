Turkey central bank maintained its key interest rates for the third
straight month, as the weak currency and high commodity prices weigh on
the inflation outlook.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to hold the key one-week
repo rate at 19.00 percent.

The bank had lifted the interest rates by 200 basis points at the March
meeting under the leadership of former governor Naci Agbal.

After taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation
expectations, the MPC said the current tight monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance will
be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April
Inflation Report's forecast path is achieved.

The committee reiterated that it will continue to use decisively all
available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price
stability.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will continue to be determined at a level above
inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong
indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5
percent target is reached, the bank said.

The statement from the Turkish central bank to leave its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate
suggested that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are standing up to political pressure to
lower interest rates, William Jackson, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. But an easing cycle is likely to begin in the third
quarter.
