The Bank of Japan is scheduled to wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on
Friday and then announce its decision on interest rates, setting the
pace for a light day in Asia-Pacific economic activity.

The central bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate
steady at -0.1 percent.

Japan also will see May figures for consumer prices; in April, overall
inflation was down 0.4 percent both on month and on year, while core CPI
was down 0.1 percent on year.
