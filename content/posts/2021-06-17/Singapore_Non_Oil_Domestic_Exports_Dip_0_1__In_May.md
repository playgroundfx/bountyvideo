The value of Singapore's non-oil domestic exports were down a seasonally
adjusted 0.1 percent on month in May, Enterprise Singapore said on
Thursday - coming in at SGD15.4 billion.

That was well shy of expectations for an increase of 4.7 percent
following the 8.8 percent decline in April.

On a yearly basis, NODX climbed 8.8 percent - missing forecasts for an
increase of 16.0 percent following the 6.0 percent increase in the
previous month.

NODX to the top 10 [markets][1] as a whole rose in May, mainly due to
China, Hong Kong and Malaysia - although NODX to the United States,
Japan and the EU 27 declined.
