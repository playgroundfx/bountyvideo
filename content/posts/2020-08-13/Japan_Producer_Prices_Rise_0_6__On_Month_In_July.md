Producer prices in Japan were up 0.6 percent on month in July, the Bank
of Japan said on Thursday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.3 percent following the
0.6 percent increase in June.

On a yearly basis, producer prices sank 0.9 percent - which also beat
expectations for a decline of 1.1 percent following the 1.6 percent drop
in the previous month.

Export prices were up 0.8 percent on month and down 3.2 percent on year,
the bank said, while import prices climbed 1.9 percent on month and
tumbled 12.6 percent on year.
