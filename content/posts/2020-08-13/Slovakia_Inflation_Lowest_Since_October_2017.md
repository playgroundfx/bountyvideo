Slovakia's consumer price inflation eased to the lowest in nearly three
years in July, figures from the Statistical Office of the Slovak
Republic showed on Thursday.

The consumer price index rose 1.7 percent year-on-year in July, slower
than the 1.8 percent increase in June. This was in line with economists'
expectation. Inflation eased for the fifth consecutive month.

The latest inflation was the lowest since October 2017.

Prices for miscellaneous goods and services grew 4.7 percent yearly in
July and education gained 4.5 percent. Prices for [health][1], and
housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels increased by 3.6
percent and 2.8 percent.

Meanwhile, prices for transport declined 3.9 percent and communication
cost remained unchanged.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in July,
reversing a 0.1 percent fall in the previous month.

The core CPI rose 1.8 percent annually in July and increased 0.1 percent
from the previous month.
