Norway's consumer confidence improved sharply in the third quarter, data
from Finans Norge showed on Thursday.

The consumer confidence index increased to -5.7 in the third quarter
from -16.7 in the previous quarter.

On an adjusted basis, consumer confidence fell to -6.6 in the third
quarter from -3.4 in the previous three months.

Households' expectation on their own finance for the next year improved
in the third quarter. Households' expectation on country's [economy][1]
for the next 12 months remained positive.

Households that are not affected by the redundancies due to Covid-19
felt that they have control over their own finances.

"The fall in interest rates has contributed to many having increased
purchasing power, and this positive effect probably overshadows the
signals of an almost zero settlement in this autumn's wage
negotiations," Finans Norge's CEO Idar Kreutzer said.

Households' expectation on the country's economy for last year was less
negative in the third quarter. Their expectation on own finances for the
past year improved.
