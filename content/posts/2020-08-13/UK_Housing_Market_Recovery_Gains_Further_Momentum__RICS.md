UK housing market recovery gained further momentum in July as the stamp
duty holiday helped to boost demand, survey data from the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, or RICS, showed Thursday.
Nonetheless, respondents were cautious on long term prospects.

A net balance of 75 percent of survey participants reported an increase
in buyer enquiries in July. Enquiries bounced again following the
lockdown induced fall seen during March to May.

Similarly, new instructions being listed onto the sales market climbed
notably, as a net 59 percent reported a growth compared to a net 41
percent in June.

Further, a net balance of +57 percent of respondents nationally posted a
rise in agreed sales over the month.

Looking ahead, near term expectations were signaling continued growth in
sales over the next three months, with a net balance of +26 percent of
contributors anticipating an increase.

But twelve-month sales projections remained negative at 10 percent as
caution remained over the reaction of the market once the furlough
scheme is phased out in October and the stamp duty holiday expires after
March 2021.  
  
The survey showed that a net balance of +12 percent of respondents
reported an increase in house prices in July versus -13 percent in June.
Further, a net 8 percent of contributors expect prices to rise over the
next twelve months.
