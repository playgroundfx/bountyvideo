UK retail sales growth eased sharply in September as fuel shortages and
wetter weather weighed on consumer confidence, data published by the
British Retail Consortium and KPMG showed on Tuesday.

Retail sales grew only 0.6 percent on a yearly basis in September after
rising 3 percent in August. At the same time, like-for-like sales fell
0.6 percent annually.

An uncertain backdrop and slower growth means the fourth quarter is
looks challenging as the economic recovery is dependent on strong retail
sales during the festive season, Helen Dickinson, chief executive at
BRC, said.

Fuel panic buying bought into sharp focus the impact supply chain
bottlenecks and labor shortages can quickly have for consumers, Paul
Martin, UK Head of Retail at KPMG, said.

The energy crisis is set to have further impact on inflation levels,
putting pressure on household spending and retailers will be hoping for
some good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the Chancellor in his Budget to help them manage
rising costs, Martin added.
