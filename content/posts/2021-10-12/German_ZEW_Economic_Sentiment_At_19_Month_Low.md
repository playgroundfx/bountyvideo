German economic confidence deteriorated for the fifth consecutive month
to hit the lowest since March 2020 amid supply bottleneck and higher
input prices, survey results from the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European
Economic Research showed on Tuesday.  
  
The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment dropped to 22.3 in October from
26.5 in September. The reading was below the economists' forecast of
24.0 and was the lowest since March 2020, when the score was -49.5.

The indicator for the current economic situation declined 10.3 points to
21.6 in October. This was the first time that the indicator has recorded
a decline after its continuous increase between February and September
2021.

The economic outlook for the German [economy][1] has dimmed noticeably,"
ZEW President Achim Wambach, said. The further decline of the ZEW
Indicator of Economic Sentiment is mainly due to the persisting supply
bottlenecks for raw materials and intermediate products.

The financial market experts expect profits to go down, especially in
export-oriented sectors such as vehicle manufacturing and
chemicals/pharmaceuticals, Wambach noted.

The survey showed that financial market experts' sentiment concerning
the economic development of the eurozone also decreased for the fifth
consecutive time. The economic sentiment index fell 10.1 points to 21.0
in October.

The indicator for the current economic situation slid 6.6 points to a
level of 15.9 points compared to September.

According to ZEW, inflation expectations for the eurozone fell slightly.
The inflation indicator came in at 17.1 points in October, which was 3.0
points lower than in the previous month. However, 49.1 per cent of the
experts still expect the inflation rate to rise further in the next six
months.
