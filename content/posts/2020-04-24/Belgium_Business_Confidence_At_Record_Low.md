Belgium's [business][1] confidence plummeted to a record low in April,
led by the business services sector and retail trade, as business
managers grew concerned over the economic impact of the coronavirus, or
Covid-19, pandemic, survey data from the National Bank of Belgium showed
on Friday.

The business confidence index dropped to -36 from -10.9 in March.
Economists had forecast a score of -21.

equipment.  
  
In the trade sector, the confidence index plunged to -41.6 from -11.7.
Retailers were largely concerned about the outlook for demand.  
  
The manufacturing confidence index slid to -32.6 from -11.2. Factories
