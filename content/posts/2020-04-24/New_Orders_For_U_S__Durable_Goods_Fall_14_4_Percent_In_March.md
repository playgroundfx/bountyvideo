A report released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed new
orders for US manufactured durable goods plunged 14.4 percent in March
of 2020, after rising by a downwardly revised 1.1 percent in February.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to fall 15 percent in
March. The drop in orders in March was the steepest since August 2014.

A sharp 41 percent decline in demand for transportation equipment, due
largely to a near 300 percent drop in orders for non-defense aircraft
and parts, amid the ongoing [coronavirus][1] pandemic, contributed to
the fall in new durable goods orders.

Excluding transportation, new orders were down 0.2 percent, the report
from the Commerce Department showed. Excluding defense, new orders fell
15.8 percent. Meanwhile, core capital goods orders, excluding aircraft
and military hardware, edged up 0.1 percent in the month, the data
showed.
