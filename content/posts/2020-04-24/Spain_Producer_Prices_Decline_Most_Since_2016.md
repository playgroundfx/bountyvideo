Spain's producer prices declined at the fastest pace in nearly four
years in March, data from the statistical office INE showed on Friday.

The producer prices index fell 5.0 percent year-on-year in March,
following a 2.3 percent decline in February. This was the biggest fall
since May 2016.

Meanwhile, excluding energy, producer price increased 0.2 percent in
March, slower than 0.6 percent in the previous month.

Consumer goods prices advanced 2.3 percent and prices of capital goods
gained 1.0 percent.

Prices for energy declined 15.9 percent annually in March and
intermediate goods prices decreased 2.3 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices decreased 3.1 percent in March,
following a 1.3 percent drop in the prior month.

Due to the emergency situation caused by [coronavirus][1], or covid-19,
many companies shut their operation and others operated less
intensively. But March data collection was largely unaffected, the
statistical office added.
