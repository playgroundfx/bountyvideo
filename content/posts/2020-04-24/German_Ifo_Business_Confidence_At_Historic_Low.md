German [business][1] confidence declined to a historic-low in April as
there was a considerable deterioration in the assessment of current
situation amid coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic, survey data from ifo
Institute showed Friday.

The business confidence index fell to 74.3 in April from 85.9 in March.
The score was forecast to fall to 80.0. The indicator declined
drastically to the lowest value ever recorded.

The decline was primarily driven by the massive deterioration in the
current situation. Companies have never been so pessimistic about the
coming months, ifo President Clemens Fuest, said.

"The [coronavirus][2] crisis is striking the German [economy][3] with
full fury," Fuest added.  
The current situation index slumped to 79.5 from 92.9 in March. The
reading was also below economists' forecast of 81.0.

At the same time, the expectations index dropped to 69.4 from 79.5 a
month ago. The expected level was 75.0.

  
In manufacturing, the business climate index declined to its lowest
level since March 2009. Industrial companies' current business situation
worsened dramatically and expectations fell to a historic low.

In the service sector, the business climate indicator fell to a record
low. Service providers never reported such a poor assessment of their
current situation. The pessimism of their expectations was also without
precedent, the survey showed.

The Business Climate Index continued to nosedive in trade. Assessments
of the current situation deteriorated sharply and expectations fell to a
new record low.

In construction, the index has never sunk so abruptly, ifo said. The
same is true for the indicator of the current situation and for
expectations.

"It will take several more months and many data points before we will
have a better grip on the full magnitude of the crisis, the permanent
damage to the economy as well as the pace of the recovery," Carsten
Brzeski, an ING economist said.

The Bundesbank on Monday said the German economy plunged into a severe
recession following the containment measures taken to contain the spread
of coronavirus. Moreover, the bank said an immediate recovery is
unlikely.
