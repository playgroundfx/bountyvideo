Singapore industrial production rose unexpectedly in March, led by a
sharp increase in the biomedical output as the demand for
pharmaceuticals surged amid the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19 pandemic,
data from the Economic Development Board showed on Friday.

Industrial production increased 16.5 percent year-on-year in March,
after a 0.7 percent decrease in February. Economists had forecast a 6.3
percent fall.

Excluding biomedical manufacturing, industrial output remained unchanged
in March, after a 2.2 percent fall in the prior month.

Among clusters, biomedical manufacturing grew 91.4 percent annually in
March. Pharmaceuticals output surged 126.6 percent, driven by higher
production of active pharmaceutical ingredients and biological products.

Precision engineering expanded 21.2 percent and those of transport
engineering and chemicals increased 7.6 percent and 0.8 percent,
respectively.

Meanwhile, electronics output and general manufacturing declined 9.2
percent and 7.9 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, industrial production increased 21.7 percent in
March, reversing a 22.1 percent rise in the prior month. Output was
expected to fall of 2.0 percent.
