The Conference Board released a report on Wednesday showing U.S.
consumer confidence improved by much more than expected in the month of
December.

The report showed the consumer confidence index climbed to 115.8 in
December from an upwardly revised 111.9 in November.

Economists had been expecting the consumer confidence index to inch up
to 110.7 from the 109.5 originally reported for the previous month.

The bigger than expected increase by the headline index reflected an
improvement in consumer expectations, with the expectations index
advancing to 96.9 in December from 90.2 in November.

The Conference Board said the percent of consumers expecting
[business][1] conditions to improve rose to 26.7 percent from 25.6
percent, while those expecting conditions to worsen fell to 17.9 percent
from 19.6 percent.

Consumers were also more optimistic about the short-term labor market
outlook but slightly less positive about their short-term financial
prospects.

Meanwhile, the report showed the present situation index edged down to
144.1 in December from 144.4 in November but remained at an elevated
level.

While consumers' appraisal of current business conditions was more
favorable in December, their assessment of the labor market was
moderately less favorable.

"Concerns about inflation declined after hitting a 13-year high last
month as did concerns about COVID-19, despite reports of continued price
increases and the emergence of the Omicron variant," said Lynn Franco,
Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.

She added, "Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending
will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected
winter surge of the pandemic."

On Thursday, the University of Michigan is scheduled to release its
revised reading on consumer sentiment in December.

The consumer sentiment index for December is expected to be unrevised
from the preliminary reading of 70.4, which was up from 67.4 in
November.
