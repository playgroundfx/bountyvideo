U.S. gross domestic product increased by more than previously estimated
in the third quarter of 2021, according to revised data released by the
Commerce Department on Wednesday.

The report said real GDP surged by 2.3 percent in the third quarter,
reflecting an upward revision from the previously estimated 2.1 percent
jump. Economists had expected the pace of GDP growth to be unrevised.

The stronger than previously estimated growth primarily reflected upward
revisions to consumer spending and private inventory investment. A
downward revision to exports limited the upside.

Despite the upward revision, the GDP growth in the third quarter still
reflects a significant slowdown from the 6.7 percent spike in the second
quarter.

The Commerce Department said the slowdown in the pace of GDP growth came
as consumer spending increased by 2.0 percent in the third quarter after
soaring by 12.0 percent in the second quarter.

With regard to inflation, the annual rate of growth in core consumer
prices, which exclude food and energy prices, was unchanged from the
previous estimate of 3.6 percent.
