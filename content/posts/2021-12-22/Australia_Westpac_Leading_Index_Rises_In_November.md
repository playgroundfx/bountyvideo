Australia's leading index improved in November but remained slightly
negative, data from Westpac showed on Wednesday.

The six-month annualized growth rate in the Westpac-Melbourne Institute
Leading Index rose to -0.2 percent in November from -0.5 percent in
October.

The index signals the likely pace of economic activity relative to trend
three to nine months into the future.

The growth rate has been in negative zone for three straight months,
partly reflecting the lockdowns in NSW and Victoria, but only marginally
below zero compared to the deeply negative reads seen during the last
year's COVID shock.

Westpac sees considerable uncertainty around the growth outlook for the
next few years. GDP growth is seen at 3.6 percent in 2021/22 and 5.6
percent in 2022/23.

Westpac said it currently favors the taper option of the Reserve Bank.
But it will review that call before the February meeting in the light of
the upcoming developments, Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac said.
