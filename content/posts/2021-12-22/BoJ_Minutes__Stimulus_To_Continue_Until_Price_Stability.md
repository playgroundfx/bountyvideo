Members of the Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Board said that the
country's [economy][1] is trending in a positive direction but remains
at risk due to Covid-19 and its variants, minutes from the bank's
meeting on October 27 and 28 revealed on Wednesday.

To that end, the members said the central bank will continue its current
favorable monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until the country reaches its price stability
target of 2 percent. Interest rates will remain at current levels for
the time being, and the members did not rule out additional stimulus if
they deemed it necessary.

They added that the depreciation of the yen has positively affected
Japan's economy through higher stock prices and an increase in profits.

At the meeting, the BoJ maintained its monetary stimulus and downgraded
its growth outlook for the current fiscal year as supply-side
constraints dampened production and exports amid weak consumption.

The board voted 8-1, to hold the interest rate at -0.1 percent on
current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central
bank. The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.
