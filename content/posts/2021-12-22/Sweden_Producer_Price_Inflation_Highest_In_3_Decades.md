rate in 30 years, Statistics Sweden said Wednesday.  
  
The domestic producer price index rose 18.1 percent year-on-year after a

from trade services of electricity, the agency said.

record high of 18.1 percent versus 17.1 percent in the previous month.  
  
Producer price inflation for the import market eased slightly to 17.2
percent from 17.5 percent.The main downward contribution came from lower
prices on crude oil.  
  
The total producer price inflation was also 18.1 percent, the highest in
30 years.

Prices rose 50.9 percent annually for energy-related products, 4.2
percent for capital goods, and 2.9 percent for consumer goods.  
  
Excluding energy, producer price inflation was 13.8 percent.
