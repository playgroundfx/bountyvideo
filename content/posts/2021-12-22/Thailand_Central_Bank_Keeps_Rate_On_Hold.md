Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged, as widely
expected, and downgraded its 2022 growth outlook citing risks posed by
the Omicron outbreak.

At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting of the Bank of Thailand,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers unanimously voted to hold the key rate at 0.50 percent.

The bank had last reduced the rate by 25 basis points in May 2020.

The MPC expected that the domestic [economy][1] to grow 0.9 percent in
2021 and to expand 3.4 percent and 4.7 percent in 2022 and 2023,
respectively, driven by domestic spending and a gradual improvement in
foreign tourist figures.

But [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers observed that the Omicron outbreak would affect the
economy in early 2022. The outlook for 2022 was downgraded from 3.9
percent.

Inflation was expected to remain within the target in the medium term,
with headline inflation projection at 1.2 percent, 1.7 percent, and 1.4
percent in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.

Headline inflation increased temporarily due to supply-side factors,
particularly energy prices, which were expected to subside in the second
half of 2022.

The setback to the tourism sector caused by the spread of Omicron means
rates are likely to remain at their current all-time low for some
considerable time, Gareth Leather and Sophie Oudea, economists at
Capital Economics, said.
