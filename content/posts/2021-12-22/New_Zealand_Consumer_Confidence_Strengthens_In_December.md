New Zealand consumer confidence improved for the first time in six
months in December, survey data from ANZ showed on Wednesday.

The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index rose to 98.3 in December
from 96.6 in the previous month. However, the index remained well below
its long-term average of 120.  
  
Perceptions of current personal financial situations fell 3 points to 1
percent.  
  
A net 12 percent expects to be better off this time next year, down
another 3 points. Although not negative, this was an unusually low
reading outside a recession.  
  
Further, households are evenly divided on whether it is a good or a bad
time to  
buy a major household item, up 6 points. This is the best retail
indicator in the survey.

Perceptions regarding the next year's economic outlook bounced 8 points
to -20 percent. Meanwhile, the five-year outlook fell another point to
-1 percent.

House price inflation expectations dropped 0.6 percentage points to 5.3
percent and CPI inflation expectations ticked down -0.1 percentage
points to 5.6 percent.
