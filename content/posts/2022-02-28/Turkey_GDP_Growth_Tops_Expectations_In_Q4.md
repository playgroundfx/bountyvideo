Turkey's economic growth accelerated more-than-expected in the fourth
quarter, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute revealed on Monday.

Gross domestic product expanded 9.1 percent from the last year,
following the 7.5 percent growth posted in the third quarter. GDP was
forecast to climb 9.0 percent.

Quarter-on-quarter, economic growth slowed to 1.5 percent in the fourth
quarter from 2.8 percent in the preceding quarter.

Turkey's [economy][1] weathered the initial fallout from the currency
crisis well, Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Nonetheless, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has only added to the headwinds
to the growth forecast as it will contribute to keeping inflation in
Turkey high for longer and threatens to weigh on the tourism recovery,
the economist added.

GDP for the whole year of 2021 grew 11.0 percent compared to 1.8 percent
expansion in 2020.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said the trade deficit
widened sharply in January due to surging imports.

Exports grew 17.2 percent annually in January. At the same time, imports
registered a strong 54.2 percent increase.

As a result, the trade gap increased to $10.26 billion from $3.06
billion in the previous year.
