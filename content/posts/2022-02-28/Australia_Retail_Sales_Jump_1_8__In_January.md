The value of retail sales in Australia was up a seasonally adjusted1.8
percent on month in January, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Monday - coming in at A$32.491 billion.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.2 percent following the
4.4 percent contraction in December.

Food retailing had the largest rise in sales this month up 2.2 per cent
which is the largest monthly rise since July 2021 with sales remaining
elevated at their fourth highest level in the series. This went
alongside a 0.8 per cent fall in cafes, restaurants, and takeaway food
services as some consumers opted to stay home.

Other industries which saw rises this month include other retailing (4.5
per cent), department stores (4.9 per cent) and household goods
retailing (0.6 per cent), while clothing, footwear and personal
accessory retailing fell 1.0 per cent as the only other industry to
fall.
