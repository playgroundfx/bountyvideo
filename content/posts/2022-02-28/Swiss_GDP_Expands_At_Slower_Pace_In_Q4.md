The Swiss [economy][1] grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter as
the restrictive measures associated with the pandemic dampened economic
activity, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, said on
Monday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.3 percent sequentially in the fourth
quarter, much slower than the 1.9 percent expansion seen in the third
quarter. Growth was forecast to slow to 0.4 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP growth slowed marginally to 3.7 percent, as
expected, from 3.8 percent in the prior quarter.

On the expenditure-side, private consumption expenditure rose only 0.3
percent sequentially in the fourth quarter. The increase of 1.0 percent
in government expenditure was stronger, driven by pandemic-related
spending.

Following a negative third quarter, there was renewed growth in
investment in equipment, up 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, construction
investment was down 0.1 percent.

Exports of goods decreased 2.2 percent, shipment of services gained 3.3
percent. At the same time, imports of goods climbed 1.2 percent, while
imports of services decreased 1.6 percent.

In the whole year of 2021, GDP was up 3.7 percent, in contrast to the
2.4 percent slump in 2020.

The recovery benefited almost all sectors of the economy in 2021, albeit
to varying degrees. The manufacturing industry grew the most, driven by
robust exports. The service sector also recovered.

The Swiss National Bank forecast the economic recovery to continue this
year, with GDP expanding around 3 percent in 2022.
