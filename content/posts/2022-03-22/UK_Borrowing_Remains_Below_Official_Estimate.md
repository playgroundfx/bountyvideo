The UK government borrowing remained below the official estimate in the
financial year to February period, data from the Office for National
Statistics showed on Tuesday.

In the financial year-to-February, public sector net borrowing excluding
banks totaled GBP 138.4 billion, the third-highest financial year-to-
February borrowing since monthly records began in 1993.

But this was GBP 25.9 billion less than the official Office for Budget
Responsibility forecast. The OBR estimated that borrowing could reach
GBP 183.0 billion in financial year ending 2022.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will present his Spring
Statement 2022 to Parliament on March 23 and the OBR publishes its new
forecast.

At the Spring Statement tomorrow, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi
Sunak will try to strike a balance between the near-term political
benefits of supporting households now with the medium-term goal of
fiscal restraint, allowing him to loosen [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) ahead of the 2024
general election, Bethany Beckett, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

In February, PSNB excluding public sector banks was GBP 13.1 billion in
February, which was GBP 2.4 billion less than in February.

Current receipts increased 8.8 percent in February from the last year.
Expenditure gained 3.8 percent as inflation sharply lifted the interest
payments on government debt.

Data showed that public sector net debt excluding public sector banks
was GBP 2,326.8 billion at the end of February, or around 94.7 percent
of gross domestic product, maintaining a level not seen since the early
1960s.

The [coronavirus][1] support schemes combined with reduced cash receipts
and a fall in GDP were cited as the major reasons for the increase in
net debt.
