UK manufacturers price expectations hit a survey record high and
production increased at a brisk pace in three months to March, survey
results from the Confederation of British Industry showed on Tuesday.

A net balance of 80 percent of manufacturers expects to raise their
prices over the coming three months, according to the latest Industrial
Trends survey results. This was the highest score since 1975.

Further, about 26 percent said order books increased in March, the
highest since November 2021, from 20 percent in February.

The output volume balance rose to 27 percent in three months to March
from 26 percent in the preceding period. A net 30 percent expects output
to rise in the coming three months.

It is positive to see that total order books remained strong in March,
with export orders above normal to the greatest since extent since March
2019, Tom Crotty, Group Director at INEOS and Chair of the CBI
Manufacturing Council, said.

But the shock to energy and other commodity [markets][1] due to the
Ukraine conflict, along with the potential for trade spillovers, will
further add to the cost-of-living squeeze, Crotty added.
