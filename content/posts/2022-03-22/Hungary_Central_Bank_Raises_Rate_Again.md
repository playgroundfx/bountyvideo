Hungary's central bank continued with the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening in March,
raising the interest rate further on Tuesday, in the backdrop of high
inflation and the high uncertainty regarding the short-term economic
outlook due to the Russia-Ukraine war.

The Monetary Policy Council raised the base rate by 100 basis points to
4.40 percent, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank said. Economists had forecast a
hike to 4.15 percent.  
  
The overnight deposit and lending rates were also raised by 100 basis
points each to 4.40 percent and 7.40 percent, respectively.

The central bank has raised the key interest rate in every [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
session since June last year.

"In the Council's assessment, the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war has
led to a further increase in upside risks to inflation: continued rises
in commodity and energy prices point to a persistently high external
inflation environment," the bank said.

"In addition, elevated inflation may persist for longer as a domestic
inflationary effect if strong price dynamics are built into economic
agents' expectations, resulting in second-round inflationary effects."

The bank said it will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until
the outlook for inflation stabilizes around the target and inflation
risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Based on the possible duration of the war and the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of sanctions,
the bank projected GDP growth of 2.5-4.5 percent for this year and
4.0-5.0 percent for next year. The [economy][1] is expected to expand
3.0-4.0 percent in 2024.  
  
Policymakers expect strong negative supply effects to drive inflation
higher.  
  
Inflation is forecast to be between 7.5 and 9.8 percent in 2022 and
between 3.3 and 5.0 percent next year. Price growth is expected to fall
back to target in 2024.
