The European Central Bank left its key interest rate and forward
guidance unchanged on Thursday.  
  
The Governing Council left its key interest rates unchanged as expected.
The main refinancing rate thus remains at zero, the deposit rate at
-0.50 percent and the marginal lending rate at 0.25 percent.  
  
The bank expects the key ECB interest rates "to remain at their present
or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching 2 percent... that
realized progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be
consistent with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent over the medium
term."

As announced in December, the bank said it will discontinue purchasing
assets under its Covid-19 pandemic stimulus scheme at the end of March.

The EUR 1,850 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP,
was launched in March 2020 to support the euro area [economy][1] and
financial system amid the risks posed by the disruptions caused by the
coronavirus pandemic.  
  
The bank also reiterated its December decision to extend the
reinvestment horizon for the PEPP to until at least the end of 2024.
Earlier, the reinvestments were set to end at the end of 2023.  
  
The monthly net purchase pace of EUR 40 billion in the second quarter
and EUR 30 billion in the third quarter under the asset purchase
programme, or APP, were also maintained. Monthly asset purchases under
the scheme are currently conducted at EUR 20 billion.  
  
From October 2022 onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset
purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion for as long
as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates,
the bank reiterated.

The ECB reaffirmed that net purchases under the PEPP could also be
resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the
pandemic.

The bank continues to expect net purchases to end shortly before it
starts raising the key ECB interest rates.

Eurozone inflation accelerated to a record 5.1 percent in January. Core
inflation is also high at 2.3 percent, well above the bank's target of
2.0 percent.

Economists widely expect the Governing Council to revise its forward
guidance in March as inflationary pressures are stronger than expected.  
  
ECB President Christine Lagarde is set to hold the customary post-
decision press conference at 08:30 am ET when she is expected admit that
euro area inflation, albeit driven by higher energy prices, is now
uncomfortably high and to drop hints regarding a possible shift in
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance in the future sessions.  
  
Capital Economics economist Andrew Kenningham said the chance of a rate
hike this year has increased significantly.

"It is quite likely that the ECB will revise its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans again in
March to prepare for a faster reduction in asset purchases, which would
put rate hikes this year on the table," the economist said.

ING economist Carsten Brzeski expects the ECB to buy more time and to
push any changes in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to the March meeting when a fresh
set of macroeconomic forecasts will be available.

"If ECB president Christine Lagarde confirms previous statements that
"it is very unlikely that we will raise interest rates in the year
2022", she would unnecessarily paint the ECB into a corner," the
economist said.  
  
Keeping the doors open for a faster reduction of asset purchases and
even a rate hike this year would be a wiser strategy to take, Brzeski
added.
