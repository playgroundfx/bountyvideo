The UAE non-oil private sector growth eased in January, survey results
from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.1 in January from 55.6 in
December. A score above 50 indicates expansion.

Business activity accelerated in January and a sharp rise in new work
led to a further expansion in output across the board.

The rate of expansion on both activity and sales eased to the lowest in
four months. New export orders increased marginally, albeit at the
softest rate in five months.

Outstanding [business][1] rose at a softer pace in January and backlogs
of work increased. Delivery time shortened for the fourth straight month
to the greatest extent since July 2020.

Input price pressures increased in January and the rate of inflation was
the highest recorded since March. Output charges continued to decline.

The number of employed dropped in January. Output expectations improved
slightly signalling a stronger forecast seen on average through 2021.

"UAE's non-oil sector entered 2022 on a strong footing, as businesses
continued to enjoy the benefits of a recovery in economic conditions and
increased demand from the Expo," David Owen, economist at IHS Markit,
said.
