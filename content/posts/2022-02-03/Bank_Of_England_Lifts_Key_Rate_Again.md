The Bank of England resorted to a back-to-back rate hike amid rising
inflation and signaled 'modest tightening' in the months ahead.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the BoE decided to increase the key
interest by 0.25 percentage points to 0.50 percent.

While five members including Governor Andrew Bailey sought 25 basis
points hike, other four members of the panel voted for a bigger 50 basis
point increase.

The bank had raised its rate by 0.15 percentage points at its December
meeting, which was the first such move since August 2018.

The central bank intends to reduce its holdings of government bonds in a
gradual and predictable manner.

The MPC unanimously decided to reduce the stock of UK government bond
purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing
to reinvest maturing assets.

The committee also voted to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial
investment-grade corporate bond purchases by ceasing to reinvest
maturing assets and by a programme of asset sales to be completed no
earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock
of corporate bond purchase.

If the [economy][1] develops broadly in line with the February Report
central projections, some further modest tightening in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
is likely to be appropriate in the coming months, the bank said.

Further, the bank expects inflation to peak at around 7.25 percent in
April. Inflation is projected to fall back to a little above the 2
percent target in two years' time and to below the target by a greater
margin in three years.
