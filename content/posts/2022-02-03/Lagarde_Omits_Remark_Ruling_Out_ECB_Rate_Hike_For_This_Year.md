European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday did not
reiterate her earlier comment that an interest rate hike is unlikely
this year, instead her remark that risks to inflation are on the upside
fueled expectations that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are gearing up for a raise later
this year.  
  
"Compared with our expectations in December, risks to the inflation
outlook are tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term,"
Lagarde said in her introductory statement to the post-decision press
conference.

"If price pressures feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises
or the [economy][1] returns more quickly to full capacity, inflation
could turn out to be higher."

Risks to the economic outlook were seen as broadly balanced.  
  
Eurozone inflation accelerated to a record 5.1 percent in January. Core
inflation is also high at 2.3 percent, well above the bank's target of
2.0 percent.

The bank expects inflation to remain elevated for longer than previously
expected.  
  
The ECB Chief said that the March and June sessions of the Governing
Council would be crucial to determine the need to change its forward
guidance.  
  
While the latest comments marked what many economists perceived as a
'hawkish shift' in stance, Lagarde stressed that the ECB will not remain
complacent, but it will not rush into any process.  
  
"We will follow the sequence that we have set for ourselves, we will
verify the forward guidance criteria and we will be gradual in whatever
we do," Lagarde said.

Earlier on Thursday, the bank left its key interest rates and forward
guidance unchanged. As announced in December, the bank said it will
discontinue purchasing assets under its Covid-19 pandemic stimulus
scheme at the end of March.

The ECB reaffirmed that net purchases under the PEPP could also be
resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the
pandemic.

From October 2022 onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset
purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion for as long
as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates,
the bank reiterated.

The bank continues to expect net purchases to end shortly before it
starts raising the key ECB interest rates.

"Taking all this into consideration and assuming that energy prices do
not dive over the next four weeks, we expect the ECB to speed up the
reduction of net asset purchases and to bring them to an end in
September, allowing the ECB to hike the deposit rate at least once
before the end of the year," ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
