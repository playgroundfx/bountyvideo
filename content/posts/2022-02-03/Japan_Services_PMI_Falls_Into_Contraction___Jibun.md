The services sector in Japan dropped into contraction territory in
January, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on Thursday with a
services PMI score of 47.6.

That's down from 52.1 in December and it moves beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New [business][1] fell back into decline in the latest survey period.
The reduction was the first for three months and modest overall. Panel
members mentioned that the spread of the Omicron variant and renewed
restrictions had weighed on demand.

Moreover, international demand also returned to contraction territory,
at a similar pace as total new orders. Where export sales fell, panel
members attributed this to a surge in infections across key
[markets][2]. Japanese service providers reduced employment levels for
the third month in a row in January, and at the fastest pace since May
2020, Anecdotal evidence suggested that retirements and the non-
replacement of voluntary leavers were behind the fall.

The survey also showed that the composite PMI sank to 49.9 in January
from 52.5 in December.

The larger services sector led the stagnation, with renewed reductions
in both activity and new work. Meanwhile, their manufacturing
counterparts saw both output and incoming business rise, with growth in
production levels at a near eight year high. The solid rise in
manufacturing orders offset a modest fall at services firms, which
resulted in the softest rise in aggregate orders in three months. Weaker
demand conditions also led to a renewed reduction in outstanding
business.
