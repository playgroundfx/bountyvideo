After reporting a sharp increase in new orders for U.S. manufactured
goods in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a report
on Thursday showing a pullback by factory orders in the month of
December.

The Commerce Department said factory orders fell by 0.4 percent in
December after surging by an upwardly revised 1.8 percent in November.

Economists had expected factory orders to dip by 0.2 percent compared to
the 1.6 percent jump originally reported for the previous month.

The pullback in factory orders came as durable goods orders slid by 0.7
percent in December after spiking by 3.2 percent in November.

Orders for non-durable goods also edged down by 0.2 percent in December
following a 0.5 percent increase in the previous month.

Meanwhile, the report showed shipments of manufactured goods rose by 0.4
percent in December after climbing by 0.7 percent in November.

Inventories of manufactured goods also increased by 0.3 percent in
December following a 0.8 percent advance in November.

With inventories and shipments both rising, the inventories-to-shipments
ratio was unchanged from the previous month at 1.46.
