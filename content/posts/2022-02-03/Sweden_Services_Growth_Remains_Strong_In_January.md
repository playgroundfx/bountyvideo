Sweden's services sector growth improved further in January, survey data
from Swedbank and the logistics association Silf showed on Thursday.

The purchasing managers' index for the services sector rose to 68.6 in
January from 67.4 in December. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion
in the sector.

"The rise was broad and may receive further support in the future when
restrictions are lifted and the spread of omicrons is reduced, which is
partly reflected in the service companies 'expansive [business][1]
plans," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

All the sub-indices increased in January. Business volume, order intake,
employment, delivery time increased.

Suppliers' input goods prices rose in January.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
66.9 in January from 65.9 in the previous month.
