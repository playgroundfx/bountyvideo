A day ahead of the release of the more closely watched monthly jobs
report, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a
modest decrease by first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in
the week ended January 29th.

The report showed initial jobless claims dipped to 238,000, a decrease
of 23,000 from the previous week's revised level of 261,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 245,000 from the
260,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average crept up to 255,000, an increase of 7,750 from the previous
week's revised average of 247,250.
