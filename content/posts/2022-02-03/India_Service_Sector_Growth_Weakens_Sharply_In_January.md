India's service sector expanded at the slowest pace in the current six-
month sequence of growth amid the escalation of the pandemic, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 51.5 in January from
55.5 in December. However, a score above neutral 50.0 indicates
expansion.

The upturn was reportedly stymied by the intensification of the
pandemic, the reintroduction of restrictions and inflationary pressures.

The survey showed that new work intake growth slowed in January as
demand was dampened by the fast spread of the Omicron variant.

New export [business][1] fell at a moderate pace that was the slowest in
the current sequence of contraction which started in March 2020.

Service sector jobs declined for the second month running in January,
owing to reduced output requirements among some businesses and future
uncertainty. Although business sentiment remained positive, it slipped
to a six-month low.

The overall input rate of inflation climbed to its highest since
December 2011 and the rate of output price inflation was moderate.

The composite output index that combines the performance of
manufacturing and services, dropped to 53.0 in January from 56.4 in the
previous month. The index signaled the slowest rate of expansion in the
current six-month period of growth.
