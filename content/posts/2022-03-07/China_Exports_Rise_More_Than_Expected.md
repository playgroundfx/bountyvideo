China's exports grew more than expected in January to February period,
figures from the General Administration of Customs revealed on Monday.

Exports increased 16.3 percent on a yearly basis, bigger than the
expected growth of 15.0 percent.

At the same time, imports advanced 15.5 percent, but slower than
economists' forecast of +16.5 percent.

As a result, the trade surplus rose to $115.9 billion. The surplus was
forecast to increase moderately to $99.5 billion from $94.5 billion in
December.
