Germany industrial orders grew at a slower pace in January, figures from
Destatis revealed on Monday.

Industrial orders expanded 1.8 percent month-on-month, slower than the
December's 3.0 percent increase. Nonetheless, this was faster than the
economists' forecast of +1.0 percent.

The slowdown was caused by the 8.3 percent decrease in domestic orders.
Meanwhile, foreign demand was up 9.4 percent.

Excluding major orders, new orders in manufacturing gained 0.8 percent
in January.

At the same time, the annual increase in orders improved to 7.3 percent
from 5.9 percent in the previous month.
