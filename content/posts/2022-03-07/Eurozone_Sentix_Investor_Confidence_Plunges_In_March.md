Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment declined dramatically to a 16-month low due
to the Ukraine war, survey results from the behavioral research firm
Sentix showed on Monday.

After two consecutive improvements, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index
plunged to -7.0 in March from +16.6 in February. This was the lowest
score since November 2020 and well below the economists' forecast of
5.3.

Both current assessment and expectations weakened notably in March. The
current situation index declined 11.5 points to 7.8, the lowest since
last May.

At the same time, the expectations index fell sharply by 34.8 points,
which was the biggest fall in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The index reached
-20.8 in March, the weakest since August 2012.

The survey showed that the German [economy][1] suffered a severe setback
with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index slid
23.1 points to -5.2 in March, the weakest since July 2020.

The dependence on Russian energy and the geographic proximity to the
crisis region weighed on the confidence, Sentix said.

The current situation index declined to 10.0 from 20.0, while the
expectations indicator logged a marked fall in March, to -19.3 from
+15.8 in February.

The survey was conducted among 1,216 [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s between March 3 and 5.
