Germany's retail sales growth accelerated notably in January, data
published by Destatis revealed on Monday.

Retail sales advanced 10.3 percent year-on-year in January, following a
0.8 percent rise each in December and November. Sales were forecast to
climb 9.8 percent.

Destatis said the strong increase in sales compared to the same month
last year is partly due to the partial lockdown in January 2021.

Data showed that many consumers preferred larger purchases, such as
furniture, to December 2020 due to the temporary reduction in VAT in the
second half of 2020.

Food, beverages and tobacco sales dropped 5.6 percent, while non-food
sales surged 22.8 percent from the last year.

On a monthly basis, retail turnover rebounded 2.0 percent after falling
4.6 percent in December. Economists had forecast an increase of 1.8
percent.
