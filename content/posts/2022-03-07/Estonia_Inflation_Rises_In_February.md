Estonia's consumer price inflation accelerated in February, data from
Statistics Estonia showed on Monday.

Consumer prices rose 12.0 percent yearly in February, following an 11.3
percent increase in January.

Cost of goods increased 10.7 percent annually and that of services grew
14.5 percent from the previous year.

"Compared to February 2021, the consumer price index was affected the
most by housing-related price changes, which contributed over a third of
the total rise in the index," Viktoria Trasanov, leading analyst at
Statistics Estonia, said.

Housing costs grew 26.9 percent annually in February and transport costs
rose 17.9 percent. Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages gained
12.4 percent and those of household goods increased 10.2 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in February, after
a 0.1 percent rise in the previous month.
