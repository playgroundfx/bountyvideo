Japan is scheduled to release a batch of data on Tuesday, headlining an
otherwise light day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. On tap are
January figures for cash earnings, current account and its leading and
coincident economic indexes, as well as February figures for bank

yen. The leading index had a score of 103.9 and the coincident was at
92.7. Bank lending in January rose 0.6 percent on year, while the eco
watchers survey for current conditions had a score of 37.9 and the
outlook was at 42.6.

Taiwan will release February figures for trade and inflation. In
January, imports were up 24.9 percent on year and exports rose an annual
16.7 percent for a trade surplus of $4.9 billion. Overall inflation was
up 0.42 percent on month and 2.84 percent on year, while wholesale
prices spiked an annual 10.83 percent.
