China's service sector logged a strong momentum in October underpinned
by [business][1] activity and new work, data published by IHS Markit
showed on Wednesday.

The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.8 in October
from 53.4 in September. The rate of growth was the quickest seen since
July.

A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

Driven by improved market conditions and increased customer demand, new
orders posted the steepest growth in three months. Export orders also
returned to growth in October.

Employment at services companies rose for the second month in a row,
though the rate of job creation remained mild overall.

Backlogs of work across China's service sector were unchanged in
October, following a three-month sequence of accumulation.

On the price front, the survey revealed that average input price
inflation increased a three-month high. Panel members attributed the
latest rise in expenses to greater staff and raw materials costs.

Subsequently, output price inflation accelerated at the fastest pace
since July.

Service providers expect a further recovery from the pandemic and
subsequent increases in client demand to support growth of business
activity over the coming twelve months.  
  
The composite output index that combines the performance of
manufacturing and services activity, gained marginally to 51.5 in
October from 51.4 in September. The upturn was driven by a further
expansion in services activity, as manufacturing production declined for
the third month in a row.  
  
A new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks has reappeared in some central and
western regions since late October, which means fresh economic
disruptions, Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group said.
It is critical to balance the goals of controlling the outbreaks and
maintaining normal economic activity.
