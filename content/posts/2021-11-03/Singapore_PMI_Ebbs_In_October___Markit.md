The private sector in Singapore continued to expand in October, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 52.3.

That's down from 53.8, although it remains above the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This marked the eleventh straight month in which the PMI printed above
the neutral 50.0 threshold, signaling improving [business][1]
conditions. The decline in the headline figure reflected sharper
declines in employment and, to a lesser extent, stocks of purchases.

Demand and output growth both accelerated in Singapore's private sector
to the fastest since July. Better economic conditions, coupled with the
introduction of vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs) in Singapore, boosted
demand.

New orders from abroad improved as well, growing at a rate only second
to the April 2018 record with higher demand stemming from US, Europe and
Asia according to panelists.
