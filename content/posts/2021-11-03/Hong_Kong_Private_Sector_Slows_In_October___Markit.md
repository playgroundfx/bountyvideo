The private sector in Hong Kong continued to expand in October, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 50.8.

That's down from 51.7, although it remains above the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This represented a ninth successive month in which the Hong Kong SAR
private sector registered better [business][1] conditions, though the
rate of growth slipped to a six-month low.

New orders and output continued to expand in October with COVID-19
conditions well under control in Hong Kong SAR. That said, the paces of
growth eased from September with anecdotal evidence suggesting some
weather disruptions underpinning the slowdown.

External demand however continued to decline both from Mainland China
and more generally abroad. Persistent COVID-19 disruptions were blamed
by panelists for the lower new orders received from outside of the Hong
Kong SAR.
