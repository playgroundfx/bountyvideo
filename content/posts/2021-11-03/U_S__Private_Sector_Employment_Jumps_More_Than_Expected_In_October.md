Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing private
sector employment in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the
month of October.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 571,000 jobs in October
after surging by a revised 523,000 jobs in September.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 400,000
jobs compared to the addition of 568,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"The job market is revving back up as the Delta-wave of the pandemic
winds down," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.

"Job gains are accelerating across all industries, and especially among
large companies," he added. "As long as the pandemic remains contained,
more big job gains are likely in coming months."
