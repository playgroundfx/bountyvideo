Malaysia's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged again, as
widely expected, on Wednesday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to
maintain the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 1.75 percent.

Policymakers viewed the current stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to be
appropriate and accommodative.

Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the bank said the
stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will continue to be determined by new data and
information and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation
and domestic growth.

Further, the bank said it remains committed to utilize its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers
as appropriate to foster enabling conditions for a sustainable economic
recovery.

Headline inflation is forecast to average within the range of between
2.0 percent and 3.0 percent for 2021. Inflation is expected to remain
moderate next year.

However, the bank cautioned that the outlook continues to be subject to
global commodity price developments and some risk from prolonged supply-
related disruptions.  
  
Going into 2022, the economic growth momentum is expected to improve,
supported by expansion in global demand, higher private sector
expenditure in line with the resumption of economic activity and
continued [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support.

With inflation set to remain subdued, interest rates will remain on hold
for some time to come, and the tightening cycle is unlikely to start
until 2023, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
