The services sector in China accelerated in October, the latest survey
from Caixin showed on Wednesday with a services PMI score of 53.8.

That's up from 53.4 in September and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New [business][1] also expanded at a stronger rate at the start of the
fourth quarter. The rate of new order growth was the steepest seen for
three months and solid overall, with a number of firms commenting that
improved market conditions and increased customer demand had supported
sales. Notably, new export orders returned to growth in October,
following a slight fall in September. Though only marginal, the increase
in foreign sales was the quickest for six months.

The survey also showed that the composite index ticked up to 51.5 from
51.4 in September.

Composite new business increased for the second straight month, and at a
solid pace that was the fastest since May. Sector data showed that both
manufacturers and service providers recorded stronger increases in sales
in October.
