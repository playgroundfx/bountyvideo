India's service sector grew at the strongest rate in ten-and-a-half
years in October amid robust output and new [business][1], survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose more-than-expected to 58.4
in October from 55.2 in September.

Economists had forecast the index to rise to 55.7. A reading above 50.0
indicates expansion in the sector.

New work intakes increased at an accelerated rate in October, the
strongest since July 2011.

Output price inflation was the strongest since July 2017 and input cost
rose for the sixteenth straight month in October.

The pace of job creation quickened to the strongest since February last
year and backlogs of works decreased for the third month in a row in
October.

Business confidence for the coming 12 months increased in October.

The overall private sector [economy][2] expanded at a sharper rate as
growth quickened among both manufacturers and service providers. The
composite output index rose to 58.7 in October from 55.3 in the previous
month.

"Companies' expenses rose notably from September, which survey
participants mainly linked to higher fuel, material, retail, staff and
transportation costs," Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director
at IHS Markit, said.
