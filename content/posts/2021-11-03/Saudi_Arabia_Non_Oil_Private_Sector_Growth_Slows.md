Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector growth eased in October, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 57.7 in October from 58.6 in
September.

This was the second highest since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in the sector.

New export work rose in October and output increased. Backlogs of work
decreased, though the rate of decline eased to the softest since April.

Purchasing activity rose at the quickest rate in three months and new
orders increased.

Delivery time reduced to the fastest since June and employment increased
in October.

Input cost rose in October with the rate of inflation quickening to the
highest in eleven months and output price increased.

Business expectations for the coming 12 months decreased in October, but
remained strong compared to 2021 average with the hopes of recovery in
activity and sales as the [economy][1] emerges from COVID-19
restrictions.
