Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing private
sector employment in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the
month of October.

ADP said private sector employment jumped by 571,000 jobs in October
after surging by a revised 523,000 jobs in September.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 400,000
jobs compared to the addition of 568,000 jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

"The job market is revving back up as the Delta-wave of the pandemic
winds down," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.

"Job gains are accelerating across all industries, and especially among
large companies," he added. "As long as the pandemic remains contained,
more big job gains are likely in coming months."

The report showed employment at large businesses shot up by 342,000
jobs, while small and medium businesses added 115,000 jobs and 114,000
jobs, respectively.

The bigger than expected increase in private sector employment also came
as employment in the service-providing sector spiked by 458,000 jobs.

Employment in the leisure/hospitality sector led the way higher, jumping
by 185,000 jobs, while employment in the professional/[business][1]
services and trade/transportation/utilities sectors also saw notable
growth.

ADP said employment in the goods-producing sector also increased by
113,000 jobs, as employment in the construction and manufacturing
sectors rose by 54,000 jobs and 53,000 jobs, respectively.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 425,000 jobs in
October after rising by 194,000 jobs in September, while the
unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 4.7 percent from 4.8
percent.
