Sweden's services sector grew at a softer pace in October, survey data
from Swedbank and Silf showed on Wednesday.

The purchasing managers' index for the services sector fell to 68.0 in
October from 69.6 in September. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion
in the sector.

"It is far above the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average (56.0) and consolidates the
image of a continued strong service [economy][1] and which is
increasingly making an impression on the labor market but also in the
service companies' [business][2] plans," Swedbank analyst Jorgen
Kennemar said.

Three of the four sub-indices declined in October with the measures of
order intake, delivery times and business volume contributing to the
decline in the services PMI.

Meanwhile, employment rose to the highest level since the autumn of
2018.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, fell to
67.0 in October from 68.2 in the previous month.
