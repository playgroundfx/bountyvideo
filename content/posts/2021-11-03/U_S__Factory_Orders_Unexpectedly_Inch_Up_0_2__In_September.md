New orders for U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly edged higher in the
month of September, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Wednesday.

The report said factory orders crept up by 0.2 percent in September
after surging by a downwardly revised 1.0 percent in August.

The uptick surprised economists, who had expected factory orders to edge
down by 0.1 percent compared to the 1.2 percent jump originally reported
for the previous month.

The unexpected increase in factory orders came as orders for non-durable
goods climbed by 0.8 percent, more than offsetting a 0.3 percent drop in
durable goods orders.

The Commerce Department also said shipments of manufactured goods rose
by 0.6 percent in September after inching up by 0.1 percent in August.

Inventories of manufactured goods also climbed by 0.8 percent in
September following a 0.7 percent increase in August.

With inventories and shipments both rising, the inventories-to-shipments
ratio was unchanged from the previous month at 1.48.
