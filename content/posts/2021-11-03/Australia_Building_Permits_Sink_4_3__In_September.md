percent increase in August.

Approvals for private sector houses dropped 16.0 percent on month to
10,168, while approvals for private sector dwellings excluding houses
jumped 18.1 percent to 7,686.

On a yearly basis, permits for private sector houses fell 2.7 percent
and those for private sector dwellings excluding houses surged 47.2
percent. Overall, permits gained an annual 12.8 percent.

The value of non-residential building approved fell 11.3 percent on
