In a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that
is has decided to begin scaling back its asset purchases later this
month.

The Fed said it plans to reduce its $120 billion in monthly bond
purchases by $15 billion per month, citing the substantial further
progress the [economy][1] has made toward its goals of maximum
employment and price stability.

Reflecting the move, the Fed plans to increase its holdings of Treasury
securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage-
backed securities by at least $35 billion per month beginning later this
month.

Beginning in December, the central bank will increase its holdings of
Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency
mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month.

The Fed expects similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases
will likely be appropriate each month but said it is prepared to adjust
the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.

"At first glance, the reluctance to pre-announce the whole month-to-
month tapering plan with an end date for mid-2022 could be considered
dovish," Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "But the alternative is that some hawkish officials might want
to speed up the taper early next year, particularly if inflation
continues to run hotter than expected."

In the statement announcing the decision, the Fed said indicators of
economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen amid
progress on Covid-19 vaccinations and strong [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support.

The statement also acknowledged supply and demand imbalances related to
the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to
sizable price increases in some sectors, although the Fed continued to
describe the factors leading to elevated inflation as transitory.

The Fed noted risks to the economic outlook remain but predicted
progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints would lead
to continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a
reduction in inflation.

Along with the plan to begin reducing its asset purchases, the Fed also
announced its widely expected decision to keep the target range for the
federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.

The central bank said it expects interest rates to remain at near-zero
levels until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with
its assessments of maximum employment and inflation is on track to
moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

"While [markets][2] are betting the Fed will be forced to raise rates
rapidly after it tapers its QE program, the statement maintained clear
guidance on the federal funds rate remaining at the effective lower
bound," said Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "We continue to expect the Fed will wait until December 2022
to proceed with rate liftoff, but we can't ignore the risk of a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
mistake with the Fed tightening too early in the face of supply-driven
inflation."

In his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed
that the decision to begin tapering asset purchases does not reflect a
direct signal regarding interest rate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

"We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the
economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal
funds rate," Powell said.

Powell argued there is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment
both in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of employment and participation.
