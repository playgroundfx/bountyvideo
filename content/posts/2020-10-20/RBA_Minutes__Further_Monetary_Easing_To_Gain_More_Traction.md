Policymakers of the Reserve Bank of Australia said further easing of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would gain more traction than earlier as the
[economy][1] reopens up.

At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting held in October, board members observed
that some parts of the transmission of easier monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) had been
impaired as a result of the restrictions on activity in parts of the
economy.

But with the opening up of the economy, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is set to gain
more traction than before, the board noted.

At the meeting, the bank had decided to maintain cash rate and the
targeted yield on three-year government bonds of 25 basis points.

The board viewed addressing the high rate of unemployment as an
important national priority.

Members recognized that while inflation can move up and down for a range
of reasons, achieving inflation consistent with the target is likely to
require a return to a tight labor market.

Regarding the nature of the forward guidance, the board said it would
not raise the cash rate until progress is being made towards full
employment and it is confidence that inflation will be sustainably
within the 2-3 percent target band.

The Board agreed to place more weight on actual, not forecast, inflation
in its decision-making, given the higher level of uncertainty.
