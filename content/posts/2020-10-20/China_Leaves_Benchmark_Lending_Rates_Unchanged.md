China's central bank left its benchmark lending rates unchanged for the
sixth consecutive month after the official data revealed that the
economic growth gained further momentum in the third quarter.

The one-year loan prime rate was retained at 3.85 percent and the five-
year loan prime rate was maintained at 4.65 percent.

The one-year and five-year loan prime rates were last reduced in April.
The one-year loan prime rate was lowered by 20 basis points and five-
year rate by 10 basis points in April.

The interest rates were expected to be retained today as the rate on its
medium-term lending facility or MLF, which serves as a guide for the
LPR, was maintained this month.

The loan prime rate is fixed monthly based on the submission of 18
banks, though Beijing has influence over the rate-setting. This new
lending rate replaced the central bank's traditional benchmark lending
rate in August 2019.

With the PBoC appearing reluctant to keep monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) loose for
longer than needed amid a broadening economic recovery, we think the
next move in the LPR will be an increase early next year, Julian Evans-
Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital Economics, said.

Chinese economic growth accelerated to 4.9 percent in the third quarter
from 3.2 percent in the second quarter.

While all major global economies are forecast to shrink this year due to
the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the International Monetary Fund had
upgraded China's growth projection to 1.9 percent from 1 percent. Growth
is forecast to zoom to 8.2 percent in 2021.
