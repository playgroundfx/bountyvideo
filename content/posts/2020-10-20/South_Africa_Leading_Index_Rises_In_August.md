South Africa's leading index increased in August, survey data from the
South African Reserve Bank showed on Tuesday.

The leading index rose 3.7 percent to 103.5 in August from 99.9 in July.

All the ten components increased in August as activity level in the
[economy][1] continued to rebound following the extended lockdown, the
central bank said.

The biggest positive contributions to the movement in the composite
leading [business][2] cycle indicator in August were increases in the US
dollar-denominated South African export commodity price index and the
RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, the bank said.

The coincident index rose to 73.4 in July from 69.8 in June.

The lagging index fell marginally to 103.5 in July from 103.6 in the
prior month.
