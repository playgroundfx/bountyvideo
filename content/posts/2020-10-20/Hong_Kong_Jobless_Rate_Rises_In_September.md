Hong Kong's jobless rate rose in the July to September period, data from
the Census and Statistics Department showed on Tuesday.

The jobless rate rose to 6.4 percent during the July to September period
from 6.1 percent in the June to August period.

The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.8 percent in July-
September.

The number of unemployed persons increased by 11,500 to 259,800 during
July-September from 248,300 in the preceding period.

Employment fell by 15,600 to 3.624 million in the three months ended in
September from 3.64 million in the previous months.

"The labor market deteriorated for the third quarter of 2020 as a whole
amid the third wave of the local epidemic, particularly in July and
August, but the pressure faced by the labor market showed signs of
stabilization towards the end of the quarter as the local epidemic
situation abated in September," the Secretary for Labor and Welfare Law
Chi-kwong said.

"Meanwhile, the Employment Support Scheme continued to provide support,"
Law added.

Further, the official said the unemployment rate of the consumption- and
tourism-related sectors including retail, accommodation and food
services sectors combined surged by 0.8 percentage point from June -
August to 11.7 percent in July - September. That was the highest since
the onslaught of SARS.

The underemployment rate for that period rose by 0.4 percentage point to
6.3 percent.

The government expects the labor market will remain under pressure in
the near term as the overall economic situation remains weak and the
global pandemic is still evolving, Law said.
