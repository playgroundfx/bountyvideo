Statistics Estonia showed on Tuesday.

The producer price index declined 2.4 percent year-on-year in September.

Prices of manufacturing fell 1.9 percent annually in September. Prices

Meanwhile, prices for mining and quarrying industry grew 0.5 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices fell 0.4 percent in

affected by price decreases in electricity and heat energy supply and in
the manufacture of electrical equipment, food products and plastic
products," Statistics Estonia analyst Eveli Sokman said.

"Price increase in the manufacture of electronic equipment also had an
impact on the index," Sokman added.
