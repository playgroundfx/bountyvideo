Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker Gertjan Vlieghe said additional monetary
stimulus is needed as the [coronavirus][1] pandemic poses downside risks
to the [economy][2].

It appears that the downside risks to the economic outlook are starting
to materialize, he said in a speech on Tuesday. "The outlook for
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is skewed towards adding further stimulus."

He observed that the speed of the recovery is likely to be slower while
the virus prevalence remains a concern, with risks of a higher and/or
more prolonged trajectory of job losses.

Since the negative interest rate has not been tried in the UK, there is
uncertainty about its effectiveness, and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee
is not at a point yet when it can reach a conclusion on this issue, the
banker said.

According to Vlieghe, the risk that negative rates end up being
counterproductive to the aims of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is low.

The next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement is due on November 5. The interest
rate currently stands at 0.10 percent.

Although additional asset purchases remain an available [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tool, the
effects of quantitative easing are state-dependent, and that a key
channel through which QE works is by affecting expected future real
interest rates, which are already very low, Vlieghe noted.

The economy is going through a process of unprecedented reallocation
across sectors. The scale and persistence of the reallocation associated
with both the pandemic and with Brexit, is likely to weigh on employment
and investment.

The risks to the economic outlook are skewed towards a longer period of
labour market slack with weak inflationary pressure.
