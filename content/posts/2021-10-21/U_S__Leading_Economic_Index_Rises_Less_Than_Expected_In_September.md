Suggesting the U.S. [economy][1] remains on a more moderate growth
trajectory compared to the first half of the year, the Conference Board
released a report on Thursday showing a modest increase by its index of
leading economic indicators in the month of September.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index edged up by 0.2
percent in September after advancing by 0.8 percent in August and 0.9
percent in July. Economists had expected the index to rise by 0.5
percent.

"The Delta variant, rising inflation fears, and supply chain disruptions
are all creating headwinds for the U.S. economy," said Ataman
Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The Conference
Board.

"Despite the LEI's slower growth in recent months, the strengths among
the components remain widespread," he added. "Indeed, The Conference
Board continues to forecast strong growth ahead: 5.7 percent year-over-
year for 2021 and 3.8 percent for 2022."

The uptick by the leading economic index reflected positive
contributions from six of the ten indicators, including the ISM New
Orders Index, the interest rate spread, and average weekly initial
jobless claims.

Negative contributions from building permits, average consumer
expectations for [business][2] conditions, average weekly manufacturing
hours, stock prices limited the upside for the index.

The report also showed the coincident economic index was unchanged in
September after inching up by 0.1 percent in August.

The lagging economic index rose by 0.3 percent in September following a
0.1 percent uptick in the previous month.
