The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in October,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Friday with a manufacturing PMI score of 57.3.

That's up from 56.8 in September, and it moves further above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Output and new order growth accelerated in their second consecutive
months of expansion amid reports of better economic conditions and
confidence by survey respondents. As a result, employment levels and
buying activity continued to expand.

The survey also showed that the services PMI climbed to 52.0 in October
from 45.5 in September, while the composite rose to 52.2 from 46.0 a
month earlier.

Hiring activity was seen in the service sector for a second straight
month, just as backlogged work started to build again after three months
of decline. This was also as service providers' [business][1] confidence
improved to the highest level since February.
