Turkey's central bank resorted to another sharp rate cut on Thursday,
despite high inflation and weaker currency.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to cut the one-week repo
rate by 200 basis points to 16.00 percent from 18.00 percent.

Markets had expected a moderate 50 basis points reduction. This was the
second consecutive reduction after a full one percentage points in
September.

The bank had last lifted the interest rates by 200 basis points at the
March meeting under the leadership of former governor Naci Agbal.  
  
Nevertheless, the committee assessed that supply-side transitory factors
leave limited room for the downward adjustment to the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate till
the end of the year.

Any remaining confidence in the credibility of Turkey's central bank was
shattered after today's larger-than-expected 200 basis point interest
rate cut, Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The economist said the lira hit a fresh record low against the dollar
and it is likely to continue to weaken as President Erdogan piles on the
pressure for further easing. The risk of another balance of payments
crisis akin to that in 2018 will continue to grow, Peach added.

The bank said the recent rise in inflation was due to transitory
factors. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary
tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed.

The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than
envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans. In addition,
strengthened macro-prudential [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework has started to curb
personal loan growth, the bank noted.

The MPC evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors
that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can have an effect, core inflation developments and
supply shocks.
