Hong Kong's unemployment rate declined in September, the labor force
statistics from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Thursday.

The unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.5 percent in three
months to September from 4.7 percent in three months to August.

The underemployment rate decreased to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in
the preceding period.

The number of unemployed persons decreased by around 7,100 to 180,600 in
July-September. Over the same period, the number of underemployed
persons also declined by around 7,200 to 79,000.

Total employment increased about 6,300 to 3.658 million in three months
to September.

"The labor market improved further along with the increasingly
entrenched economic recovery," the Secretary for Labor and Welfare, Dr
Law Chi-kwong, said.
