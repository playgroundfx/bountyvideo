UK manufacturers expect new orders to grow at a faster pace in the next
quarter, survey results from the Confederation of British Industry
showed on Thursday.

According to the Industrial Trends survey results, a net of 22 percent
said new orders grew in three months to October, which was slower than
July's 48 percent.

Manufacturers expect total new orders growth to pick up next quarter,
with the balance at 29 percent, driven by acceleration in both domestic
and export order growth.

A net balance of 15 percent said output volumes expanded in three months
to October compared to 16 percent in September. A net 33 percent expects
output growth to accelerate substantially in the next quarter.

Looking ahead to the next three months, costs growth is set to speed up
further, with both domestic and export price inflation expected to
accelerate, the survey showed.

"From higher material costs to labour shortages, manufacturers continue
to face a number of serious global supply challenges hampering their
ability to meet strong demand, Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist,
said.

Manufacturers are using key levers, such as hiring new workers and
planning further investment in plant and machinery and training, to
expand production. "But with both orders and costs growth expected to
climb over the next quarter, we're not out of the woods yet," the
economist said.
