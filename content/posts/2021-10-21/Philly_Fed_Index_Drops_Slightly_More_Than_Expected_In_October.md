Manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area saw slower growth in the
month of October, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity fell to
23.8 in October from 30.7 in September, although a positive reading
still indicates growth. Economists had expected the index to drop to
25.0.

Looking ahead, the survey's future indexes suggest that the surveyed
firms remained generally optimistic about growth over the next six
months.
