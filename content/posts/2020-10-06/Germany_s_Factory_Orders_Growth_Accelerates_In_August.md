Factory orders climbed 4.5 percent month-on-month, which was faster than
the 3.3 percent rise in July and the 2.6 percent increase economists'
had forecast.

Domestic orders climbed 1.7 percent, while foreign demand logged a
notable growth of 6.5 percent. New orders from the euro area went up
14.6 percent and that from other countries increased by 1.5 percent.

On a yearly basis, manufacturing orders dropped at a slower pace of 2.2
percent, following a 6.9 percent decrease in July.

Manufacturing turnover dropped 0.1 percent on month in August versus a
5.2 percent rise in July.
