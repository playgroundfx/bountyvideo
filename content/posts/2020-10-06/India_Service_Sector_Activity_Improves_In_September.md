September, survey results from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The IHS Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 49.8 in
September from 41.8 in August. Any reading below 50.0 indicates
contraction in the sector.

and new orders from abroad contracted at the slowest pace in six months.

hopping that a vaccine for Covid-19 will be rolled out.

a quickest rate than in August.

backlogs of work was little-changed from August's survey record.

was the highest in seven months.

The survey showed that the composite output index, which measures
combined services and manufacturing output, rose to 54.6 in September
from 46.0 in August.
