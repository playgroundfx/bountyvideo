Australia's job advertisements grew at a faster pace in September, data
from ANZ showed on Tuesday.

Job ads increased 7.8 percent month-on-month in September, following a
2.6 percent rise in August.

Job advertisements were still down 21.0 percent since February.

"There were week-to-week gains throughout the month, which was positive
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) given the ongoing restrictions in Victoria," ANZ Senior Economist
Catherine Birch said.

Those previous levels reflected churn, which means workers changing
jobs, and skills and labor mismatches, and rising labor demand as the
[economy][1] expanded, the economist said.

"Yet right now, we need to get a huge volume of people - who were until
recently employed - back into the workforce, along with new entrants and
those wanting to re-enter the workforce," Birch added.
