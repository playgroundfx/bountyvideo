Germany's construction sector contracted further in September amid an
ongoing decline in new orders and pessimistic expectations for activity
over the year ahead, survey data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 45.5 in September
from 48.0 in August. A score below 50 indicates contraction.

The main drag on total industry activity was from the commercial
building sub-sector, where work fell sharply and at the fastest rate for
three months.

Civil engineering activity also remained in negative territory, albeit
with the pace of fall easing to the weakest since February. The only
bright spot was housing activity, though the activity grew at the
softest pace for three months.

New orders continued to decrease as clients were reluctant to commit to
new projects amid the pandemic.

Companies continued to scale back workforce numbers and sentiment
weakened for the first time in six months.

Turning to costs, data showed a slight uptick in the rate of purchase
price inflation. There was a moderate increase in rates charged by sub-
contractors.

Construction activity had looked to be stabilizing, so the drop in the
PMI to a three-month low in September comes as a disappointment and
shows the sector is not quite out of the woods yet, Phil Smith,
principal economist at IHS Markit, said.
