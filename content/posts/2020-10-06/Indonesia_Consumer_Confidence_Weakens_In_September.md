Indonesia's consumer confidence weakened in September after improving in
the previous few months, survey data from Bank Indonesia showed on
Tuesday.  
  
The consumer confidence index fell to 83.4 from 86.9 in August.  
  
Sentiment deteriorated in 13 out of the 18 cities surveyed, most
significantly in Jakarta, the bank said.  
  
Consumers' expectations regarding economic conditions in the next six
months weakened due to lower optimism on [business][1] performance, job
opportunities, and income. Expectations on the current economic
situation and conditions for buying durable goods also weakened.
