Australia had a seasonally adjusted merchandise trade surplus of A$2.643
billion in August, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of A$5.154 billion and was
down from A$5.607 billion in July.

Exports were down 4.0 percent for the second straight month, while
imports gained 2.0 percent on month after rising 7.0 percent in the
previous month.

Exports saw a fall of A$2.234 billion (62 percent) in non-monetary gold,
a fall of A$140 million (3 percent) in services; a rise of A$577 million
(3 percent) in non-rural goods; and a rise of A$366 million (12 percent)
in rural goods.

Imports saw a rise of A$553 million (6 percent) in consumption goods; a
rise of A$323 million (3 percent) in intermediate and other merchandise
goods; and a rise of A$106 million (10 percent) in non-monetary gold.
