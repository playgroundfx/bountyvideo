Japan's retail sales growth eased sharply in November and Tokyo consumer
prices logged its third consecutive fall in December as the third wave
of [coronavirus][1] infections weighed on demand, official data showed
Friday.

Retail sales grew 0.7 percent in November from the last year, but much
slower than the 6.4 percent growth seen in October, the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry reported.

Economists had forecast an annual growth of 1.7 percent. Nonetheless,
this was the second consecutive growth after seven straight months of
decline.

Elsewhere, data published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications showed that the consumer price index for Tokyo dropped
for the third straight month in December.

The Tokyo CPI declined 1.3 percent annually, following a 0.8 percent
drop in November.

Excluding fresh food, consumer prices were down 0.9 percent versus a 0.7
percent decrease in November. This was the biggest fall since 2010.
Prices were expected to decrease 0.8 percent.

Another report from the ministry showed that the jobless rate fell to a
seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent in November, while the rate was forecast
to remain unchanged at 3.1 percent.

The number of employed persons decreased by 550,000 from the previous
year, which was the eighth consecutive fall. At the same time,
unemployment increased 440,000 annually to 1.95 million.

The ministry said the jobs-to-applicant ratio rose to 1.06 from 1.04 in
October.
