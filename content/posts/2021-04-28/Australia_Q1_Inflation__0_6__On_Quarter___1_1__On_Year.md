Consumer prices in Australia were up 0.6 percent on quarter in the first
quarter of 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.

That was shy of expectations for 0.9 percent, which would have been
unchanged from the three months prior.

On a yearly basis, inflation gained 1.1 percent - also missing forecasts
for 1.4 percent but still up from 0.9 percent in the previous three
months.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's trimmed mean was up 0.3 percent on
quarter and 1.1 percent on year - slowing from 0.4 percent on quarter
and 1.2 percent on year in the previous quarter.

The RBA's weighted mean rose 0.4 percent on quarter and 1.3 percent on
year, slowing from 0.5 percent on quarter and 1.4 percent on year in the
previous three months.
