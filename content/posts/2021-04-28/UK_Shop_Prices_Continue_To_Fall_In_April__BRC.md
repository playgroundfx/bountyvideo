UK shop prices continued to decline in April, data from the British
Retail Consortium showed on Wednesday.

The shop price index dropped 1.3 percent year-on-year in April,
following a 2.4 percent decrease in March.

Both food and non-food prices declined in April. The fall in food prices
was the result of fewer promotions compared to previous year.

In the months ahead retailers will have to battle the cost pressures
from Brexit red-tape, rising shipping costs due to international supply
issues, as well as increasing global food and oil prices, Helen
Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

As these costs filter through, retailers may be left with no option but
to pass on some of these costs to consumers, Dickinson added.
