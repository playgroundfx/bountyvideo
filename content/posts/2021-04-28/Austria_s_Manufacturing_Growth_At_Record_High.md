Austria's manufacturing activity grew at a record pace in April, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline UniCredit Bank Austria manufacturing Purchasing Managers'
Index rose to 64.7 in April from 63.4 in March. This was its highest
reading since data collection began in October 1998.

Manufacturers reported record growth in new orders as well as a further
acceleration in the rate of job creation. The rate of production growth
remained strong but eased slightly from March's 39-month high.

Backlogs continued to rise, as a number of firms reported difficultly
keeping up with demand amid growing reports of supply problems.

Supply shortages and higher transport costs in turn led to a further
steep rise in average prices paid for purchases, with the rate of
inflation at a series-record high in April. Supportive demand conditions
allowed many manufacturers to pass on at least part of the burden of
higher costs to clients.

April's survey continued to show strong expectations among Austrian
manufacturers for activity over the coming year.
