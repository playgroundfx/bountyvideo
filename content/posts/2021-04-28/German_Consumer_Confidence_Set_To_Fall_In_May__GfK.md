Germany's consumer confidence is set to weaken in May as rising cases of
infections and the subsequent tightening of restrictions dampened income
expectations as well as the economic outlook, survey results from the
market research group GfK showed on Wednesday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index fell to -8.8 in May from
revised -6.1 in April. The score was forecast to improve to -3.5.

"The third wave will ensure that the recovery of the domestic
[economy][1] is still a long way off," Rolf BÃ¼rkl, GfK consumer expert
said. As in 2020, consumption will not be a pillar of the economy this
year.

While the propensity to buy increased moderately, economic and income
expectations logged significant losses in April.

The income expectations indicator dropped 13 points to 9.3 points in
April. The tightening of the lockdown is likely to have reignited
unemployment fears and also raised concerns about companies moving into
bankruptcy.

In contrast to the income prospects, the propensity to buy has so far
been resisting the third wave. The corresponding index advanced to 17.3
points from 12.3 a month ago. This was the third consecutive increase.

The economic expectations index fell to 7.3 points from 17.7 in the
previous month. Despite rising exports, weak consumer spending is
weighing on economic growth this year.
