The Asian Development Bank forecast developing Asia to rebound this year
although the renewed outbreak of the [coronavirus][1] poses threat to
the recovery.

According to the latest Asian Development Outlook 2021, released
Wednesday, economic growth in developing Asia will rebound to 7.3
percent this year from -0.2 percent last year, underpinned by global
recovery and early progress in vaccination. However, growth will
moderate to 5.3 percent in 2022.

"Growth is gaining momentum across developing Asia, but renewed COVID-19
outbreaks pose a threat to recovery," ADB chief economist Yasuyuki
Sawada, said.

"Economies in the region are on diverging paths. Their trajectories are
shaped by the extent of domestic outbreaks, the pace of their vaccine
rollouts, and how much they are benefiting from the global recovery,"
Sawada added.

The agency noted that robust exports coupled with gradual recovery in
household consumption will boost economic activity in China this year.
The country's GDP is projected to expand 8.1 percent in 2021 and 5.5
percent in 2022.

India's [economy][2] is expected to grow 11.0 percent in the fiscal year
2021, which ends on March 31, 2022, amid a strong vaccine drive. GDP
growth in the FY2022 is seen at 7.0 percent.

South Asia's GDP growth is expected to rebound to 9.5 percent in 2021,
following a 6.0 percent contraction in 2020, before moderating to 6.6
percent next year. East Asia's GDP is expected to grow 7.4 percent in
2021 and 5.1 percent in 2022.

Further, the trade-dependent economies of Southeast Asia are also
projected to recover, with the sub-region forecast to grow 4.4 percent
this year and 5.1 percent in 2022 after contracting 4.0 percent in 2020.

Pacific economies, still affected by global travel restrictions and a
collapse in tourism, will post moderate growth this year at 1.4 percent,
before expanding by 3.8 percent next year, the Manila-based lender said.

On the price front, the ADB said inflation in developing Asia is set to
ease to 2.3 percent from 2.8 percent in 2020, as food-price pressures
ease in India and China. Nonetheless, the rate will rise to 2.7 percent
in 2022.
