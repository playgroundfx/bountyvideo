Citing progress on Covid vaccinations and strong [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support, the
Federal Reserve on Wednesday upgraded its assessment of the U.S.
[economy][1] but maintained its ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as widely
expected.

A statement from the Fed noted indicators of economic activity and
employment have "strengthened," which reflects a modest upgrade from
last month, when the central bank said the indicators have "turned up
recently."

The Fed also said the sectors most adversely affected by the
[coronavirus][2] pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement.

After previously saying inflation continues to run below 2 percent, the
Fed now acknowledges that inflation has risen but largely attributed the
increase to "transitory factors."

The statement from the central bank also said risks to the economic
outlook remain due to the ongoing public [health][3] crisis, although
that reflects an improvement from last month, when the Fed cited
"considerable risks to the economic outlook."

Despite the improvements mentioned in the statement, the Fed once again
kept the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.

The Fed also reiterated that it expects rates to remain at near-zero
levels until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with
its assessments of maximum employment and inflation is on track to
moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

The central bank also said it plans to continue its bond purchases at a
rate of at least $120 billion per month until "substantial further
progress" has been made toward its goals of maximum employment and price
stability.

Paul Ashworth, Chief US Economist at Capital Economics, said there is
nothing in the announcement to change his view that the Fed won't begin
to taper its asset purchases until the start of next year and won't
begin to raise interest rates until late 2023.
