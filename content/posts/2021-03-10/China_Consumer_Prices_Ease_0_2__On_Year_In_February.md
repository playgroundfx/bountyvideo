Consumer prices in China were down 0.2 percent on year in February, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.

That exceeded expectations for a decline of 0.4 percent and was up from
-0.3 percent in the previous month.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices climbed 0.6 percent - again beating
forecasts for a gain of 0.4 percent but down from 1.0 percent a month
earlier.

The bureau also said that producer prices were up 1.7 percent on year -
exceeding expectations for an increase of 1.5 percent and up sharply
from 0.3 percent in January.
