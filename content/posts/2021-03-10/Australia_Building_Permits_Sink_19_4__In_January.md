The total number of building permits issued in Australia in January
dropped a seasonally adjusted 19.4 percent on month in January, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday - standing at 15,926.

That was in line with expectations following the 12.0 percent gain in
December.

Permits for private sector houses fell 12.2 percent on month, while
private sector dwellings excluding houses plummeted 39.5 percent.

On a yearly basis, overall building permits were up 19.0 percent, while
private sector houses surged 38.0 percent and private sector dwellings
excluding houses tumbled 22.7 percent.

Dwelling approvals fell across all states; Queensland (33.3 percent),
Tasmania (24.8 percent), New South Wales (23.2 percent), Victoria (13.0
percent), Western Australia (4.1 percent) and South Australia (0.5
percent).

Approvals for private sector houses also fell across all states in
January; New South Wales (19.0 percent), Queensland (19.0 percent),
Victoria (8.4 percent), South Australia (3.7 percent) and Western
Australia (0.9 percent).

The value of total building approved fell 16.8 percent in January, in
seasonally adjusted [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). The value of non-residential building fell
16.3 percent, after rising 11.3 percent in December.

The value of total residential building approved fell in January, by
17.1 percent. This was comprised of a 17.8 percent fall in new
residential building, and a 12.7 percent fall in residential alterations
and additions.

Also on Wednesday, the latest survey from Westpac Bank showed that
consumer confidence in Australia is picking up steam in March, rising
2.6 percent to a score of 111.8. That follows the 1.9 percent gain in
February to 109.1.

Australia's success in containing COVID-19, the promise of vaccine
rollouts bringing an end to the pandemic, and support from stimulatory
government policies have all contributed to the sustained lift.

All components of the Index were higher in March. Confidence around the
economic outlook led the gains with the '[economy][1], next 12 months'
sub-index up 3.7 percent and the 'economy, next 5 years' sub-index up
2.3 percent.

Assessments of family finances also improved. The 'finances compared to
a year ago' sub-index lifted by 2.8 percent and the 'finances, next 12
months' sub-index was up by 0.2 percent. The 'time to buy a major
household item' sub-index rose by 3.7 percent.
