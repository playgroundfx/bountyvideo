Labor productivity in the U.S. plunged by even more than initially
estimated in the third quarter, according to revised data released by
the Labor Department on Tuesday.

The Labor Department said labor productivity tumbled by 5.2 percent in
the third quarter compared to the previously reported 5.0 percent
nosedive. Economists had expected the slump in productivity to be
revised to 4.9 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed the spike in unit labor costs during the
third quarter was upwardly revised to 9.6 percent from 8.3 percent. The
surge in unit labor costs was expected to be revised to 8.4 percent.
