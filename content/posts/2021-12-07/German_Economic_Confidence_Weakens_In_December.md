Germany's economic confidence weakened in December as supply bottlenecks
continue to weigh on production and retail sales, survey results from
the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research showed on
Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell 1.8 points to 29.9 in
December. Nonetheless, the score remained above the expected level of
25.1.

The current conditions index plunged 19.9 points to -7.4 in December.
This was the first time since last June that the indicator entered the
negative territory. The reading was forecast to fall to 5.0.

The outlook for economic development in the next six months also
deteriorated considerably.

"The decline in economic expectations shows that hopes for much stronger
growth in the next six months are fading," ZEW President Achim Wambach,
said. Especially the earnings expectations of export-oriented and
consumer-related industries are assessed more negatively, Wambach added.

Meanwhile, sentiment among financial market experts regarding the
economic developments in the euro area improved marginally in December.
The corresponding index rose slightly by 0.9 points to 26.8 points.

Nonetheless, the situation indicator fell to a new level of minus 2.3
points, dropping 13.9 points compared to November.

Further, the survey showed that inflation expectations for the currency
bloc continued to decline sharply in the current period.

The indicator currently stands at minus 33.3 points, which corresponds
to a decrease of 19.0 points compared with the November result. About
54.6 percent of the experts expect the inflation rate to decline in the
next six months.
