The UAE non-oil private sector growth was the highest since June 2019
during November, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.9 in November from 55.7 in
October. A score above 50 indicates expansion.

"November data showed the UAE [economy][1] still running strong, with
the rate of growth even accelerating from October when the start of Expo
2020 led to an upsurge in activity," David Owen, an economist at IHS
Markit, said.

Output and new [business][2] increased in November, but export sales
increased at a softer pace.

New orders increased sharply in November and suppliers' delivery time
improved. Employment levels remained unchanged after expanding for five
successive months.

Output charges declined in November and input prices rose at the slowest
pace since May.

The outlook for the next 12 months weakened in November.
