Australia's central bank left its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged, as widely
expected on Tuesday, and assessed that the new [coronavirus][1] variant
Omicron is unlikely to derail the recovery.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a record low of
0.10 percent.

The board also voted to continue with the purchase of government
securities at the rate of A$4 billion a week until at least mid February
2022.

The Board reiterated that it will not increase the cash rate until
actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range.

This will require the labor market to be tight enough to generate wages
growth that is materially higher than it is currently. This is likely to
take some time and the Board is prepared to be patient, RBA added.

Lowe said the emergence of the Omicron strain is a new source of
uncertainty, but it is not expected to derail the recovery. The
[economy][2] is expected to return to its pre-Delta path in the first
half of 2022.

Although inflation is 3 percent, underlying inflation is still low. A
further, but only gradual, pick-up in underlying inflation is expected,
the bank noted. The central forecast is for underlying inflation to
reach 2.5 percent over 2023.

The board observed that as the labor market tightens, wages growth is
expected to pick-up. This pick-up is set to be only gradual, although
there is uncertainty about the behavior of wages as the unemployment
rate declines to [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low levels.

February has recently been a month for some bold action by the RBA
Governor, Bill Evans at Westpac said. The governor will need more time
before he signals a retreat from the very dovish stance. The first-rate
hike will be at the February Board meeting in 2023, Evans said.
