China's exports grew more than expected in November, reports said citing
data from the General Administration of Customs on Tuesday.

Exports grew 22 percent on a yearly basis in November, which was bigger
than the economists' forecast of 19 percent.

Likewise, imports advanced 31.7 percent from the last year. Economists
had forecast an annual increase of 19.8 percent in November.

As a result, the trade surplus came in at $71.7 billion in November.
However, this was below the expected level of $82.7 billion.
