The euro area [economy][1] expanded as initially estimated in the third
quarter largely driven by household spending, estimates released by
Eurostat showed on Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew at a steady pace of 2.2 percent in the third
quarter. The estimate for the second quarter was revised up from 2.1
percent and the third quarter rate was confirmed by Eurostat.

On a yearly basis, GDP advanced 3.9 percent instead of 3.7 percent
expansion estimated previously. However, this was slower than the second
quarter's 14.4 percent increase.

With Covid cases rising, governments tightening restrictions, and supply
problems constraining output, the economy looks set for a very weak
fourth quarter, Jack Allen-Reynolds, an economist at Capital Economics.  
  
Household consumption growth improved to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent.
Meanwhile, the increase in government spending eased to 0.3 percent from
2.1 percent.

On the other hand, gross fixed capital formation dropped 0.9 percent,
reversing a 1.3 percent rise in the second quarter.

Both exports and imports grew at slower rates in the third quarter.
Shipments were up 1.2 percent and imports gained 0.7 percent.

Eurostat estimates showed that 161.0 million people were employed in the
third quarter. In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, employment remained
0.3 million below the level of the fourth quarter of 2019.

The number of employed persons increased by 0.9 percent sequentially and
increased 2.1 percent from the same period last year.

The combination of GDP and employment data allows an estimation of labor
productivity. Productivity based on persons increased by 1.8 percent
from the same period last year. Based on hours worked, productivity rose
0.8 percent annually.
