Estonia's consumer prices rose in November, data from Statistics Estonia
showed on Friday.

The consumer price index rose 8.8 percent year-on-year in November,
following a 7.0 percent growth in October.

"Compared to November 2020, the consumer price index was affected the
most by housing-related price changes, which contributed more than a
third of the total rise in the index," Viktoria Trasanov, leading
analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.

Prices for petrol increased 28.3 percent and diesel prices rose 40.0
percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices grew 1.8 percent in November, after
a 0.2 percent decline in the previous month.
