Overall consumer prices in the Philippines were up 4.2 percent on year
in November, the National Statistics Office said on Tuesday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 3.9 percent and was down
from 4.6 percent in October.

On a monthly basis, overall inflation gained 0.7 percent - beating
forecasts for 0.23 percent and accelerating from 0.2 percent in the
previous month.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, advanced an annual 3.3
percent. That beat expectations for an increase of 3.15 percent and was
down from 3.4 percent a month earlier.
