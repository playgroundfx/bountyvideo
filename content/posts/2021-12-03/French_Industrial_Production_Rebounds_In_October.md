France's industrial production rebounded in October, largely led by a
strong recovery in the manufacture of transport equipment, preliminary
data from the statistical office INSEE showed Friday.

Industrial production grew 0.9 percent from September, when it decreased
1.5 percent. Economists had forecast 0.5 percent gain.

Manufacturing output also grew 0.9 percent monthly in October, following
a 1.6 percent slump in the previous month.

INSEE attributed the latest rebound in production to a strong recovery
in the manufacture of transport equipment, up 8.8 percent monthly versus
an 8.6 percent fall in the previous month.

Within the group, production of other transport equipment stood out with
a 13.9 percent gain, after a 4.2 percent fall, largely driven by the
manufacture of air and spacecraft equipment.

Production also rebounded in the manufacture of food products and
beverages, mining and quarrying, energy, water supply and in the
manufacture of coke and refined petroleum.

Meanwhile, output declined further in the other manufacturing group and
dropped in the production of machinery and equipment.

The construction output increased 4.8 percent from the previous month
after remaining unchanged in September.

Among the main industrial groupings, production rebounded in capital
goods, intermediate goods, energy and consumer durables, while output
declined further in consumer non-durables.

Compared to February 2020, a month before the first general lockdown
linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, the industrial production was lower by
4.5 percent and the manufacturing output by 5.3 percent in October.

On a year-on-year basis, industrial production decreased 0.5 percent in
October, erasing a similar size gain in September. The decline was the
first since February. Manufacturing output edged up 0.1 percent after a
0.3 percent fall in the previous month.
