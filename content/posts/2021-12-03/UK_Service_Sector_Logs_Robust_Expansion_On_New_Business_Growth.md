The UK service sector continued to log strong recovery in November
driven by the fastest rise in new [business][1] intakes for five months,
final data from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply services Purchasing
Managers' Index dropped to 58.5 in November from October's three-month
high of 59.1. The flash reading was 58.6.  
  
As a result, output growth in the final quarter of 2021 remained well on
track to exceed that seen in the third quarter.

New business growth was the strongest since June underpinned by strong
business and consumer spending. Export sales gained momentum, with the
rate of growth the steepest for over four-and-a-half years.

Service providers continued to indicate robust demand for staff in
November, with employment numbers rising for the ninth consecutive
month.

Meanwhile, imbalance demand and supply contributed to another build up
of unfinished work in November.  
  
Data pointed to surging input costs as suppliers passed on higher raw
material prices and transportation bills. The latest rise in input
prices was the strongest in 25 years of data collection. Prices charged
by service sector firms also rose at a survey record pace in November.

The degree of optimism about business activity growth was the lowest for
12 months.  
At 57.6 in November, the composite output index dipped slightly from
57.8 in October but remained above the 50.0 no-change threshold for the
ninth consecutive month. The flash score was 57.7.

The vast majority of survey responses in November were received prior to
the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of the Omicron variant, however, which has the potential to
derail near-term growth prospects and add to international supply chain
disruption, Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
