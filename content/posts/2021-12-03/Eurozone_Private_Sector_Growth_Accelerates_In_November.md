Eurozone private sector growth re-accelerated in November primarily
reflecting the resilience in the service sector as severe supply-related
constraints weighed on manufacturing activity, final survey results from
IHS Markit showed on Friday.  
  
Official data showed that retail turnover in the currency bloc
recovered, as expected, in October despite a fall in food sales.

The final composite output index rose to 55.4 in November from 54.2 in
October, private survey data revealed. The faster growth ended a three-
month sequence of slowing growth in November.  
  
Although the reading was below the flash 55.8, the index stayed above
the neutral 50.0 mark signaling expansion in the private sector.

The overall improvement reflects the strong performance of services
activity and masks the second-softest increase in manufacturing
production since its recovery began in July 2020.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 55.9, down from 54.6
in October. The flash reading was flash 56.6.

An improvement in the rate of economic growth signaled by the eurozone
PMI looks likely to be short-lived, Chris Williamson, chief
[business][1] economist at IHS Markit said.

With the data collected prior to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of the Omicron variant, sentiment
about near-term prospects will inevitably have been knocked even
further, the economist added.

Data split by member states monitored by the survey showed that Spain,
Italy and France all recorded quicker upturns which were well in excess
of their [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) averages. However, it was in the currency bloc's
largest [economy][2], Germany, where the slowest expansion was seen.

Germany's final composite PMI came in at 52.2 in November, up marginally
from October's eight-month low of 52.0 but below the flash 52.8. At the
same time, the services PMI dropped to 52.7 from 52.4. The reading was
also below the initial estimate of 53.4.

France's private sector expanded for the eighth consecutive month in
November. That said, the service sector was the sole driving force as
manufacturing output levels were stagnant.

The final composite output index improved to 56.1 from 54.7 a month ago.
The flash score was 56.3. The services PMI rose to 57.4 from 56.6 in
October and remained below the initial score of 58.2.

Italy's private sector continued to expand in November, with the rate of
growth the fastest since August and sharp overall. The composite output
index rose to 57.6 from 54.2 in October. At the same time, he services
PMI advanced to 55.9 from 52.4 a month ago.

Growth of Spain's private sector economy improved in November to a
three-month high. The composite output index climbed to 58.3, up from
56.2 in October and indicated growth for a ninth month in a row.

The services PMI reached a three-month high of 59.8, up from 56.6 in
October. Economists had forecast the index to climb to 58.8.

Elsewhere, data published by Eurostat showed that Eurozone retail sales
increased 0.2 percent in October after falling 0.4 percent in the
previous month.

On a yearly basis, retail sales growth eased to 1.4 percent in October
from 2.6 percent in the previous month. Sales were forecast to grow 1.2
percent.
