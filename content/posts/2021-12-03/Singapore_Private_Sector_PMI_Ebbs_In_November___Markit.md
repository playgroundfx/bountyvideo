The private sector in Singapore continued to expand in November, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Friday with a PMI score of 52.0.

That's down from 52.3 in October, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Private sector output rose for the twelfth straight month in November
and at the fastest rate since July. Better demand conditions, set
against the backdrop of opening of vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs),
enabled output to rise at a faster rate in November according to
panelists.

New orders continued to grow at a strong rate in November following the
gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Singapore. Growth of foreign
demand notably surged to a record rate in November, with anecdotal
evidence suggesting better global demand having been witnessed.
