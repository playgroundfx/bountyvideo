Sweden's services sector expanded at the fourth fastest pace in the
survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in November, survey data from Swedbank and Silf showed on
Friday.

The purchasing managers' index for the services sector rose to 68.7 in
November from 68.0 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion
in the sector.

"The Swedish service [economy][1] continues to show a high level of
activity and rising [business][2] volume plans, but risks increased
challenges if the spread of infection increases and new restrictions
were to be introduced," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

The sub-index for order intake rose the most in November and business
volume increased. The order backlog index reached a new record and
business plans remained at high levels.

Meanwhile, employment and delivery times decreased.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
67.2 in November from 66.9 in the previous month.
