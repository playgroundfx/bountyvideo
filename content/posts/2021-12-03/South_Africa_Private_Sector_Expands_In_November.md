South Africa's private sector expanded to the highest level in six
months in November, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.7 in November from
48.6 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

New orders rose marginally in November, while export sales declined for
the sixth straight month.

That said, firms were unable to increase their output and some clients
delayed their orders due to lack of raw material supply and vendor
delays.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in November and firms reduced their
purchasing and stock levels.

Input prices rose at a quicker pace and output costs increased sharply
in November.

Employment increased for the first time since August and backlogs of
work eased for eight months.

The outlook for the next 12 months remained strong in November.

"In addition, the country now faces fresh challenges from the Omicron
variant, which has led to renewed travel barriers and economic
uncertainty, and shows that the recovery from the pandemic is still not
as smooth as businesses would prefer," David Owen, economist at IHS
Markit, said.
