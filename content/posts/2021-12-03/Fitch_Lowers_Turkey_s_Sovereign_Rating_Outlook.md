Fitch Ratings downgraded the outlook on Turkey's sovereign ratings to
Negative from Stable, citing various risks to macroeconomic and
financial stability and potential external financing pressures.

The rating agency said the central bank's premature monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
easing cycle and the prospect of further rate cuts or additional
economic stimulus ahead of the 2023 presidential election have led to a
deterioration in domestic confidence, reflected in a sharp depreciation
of the Turkish lira and rising inflation.

These developments create risks to macroeconomic and financial stability
and could potentially re-ignite external financing pressures, Fitch
noted.

Further, the agency viewed that the proximity of the 2023 electoral
cycle will have an impact on [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) direction and expectations of
economic actors.

The sovereign ratings were affirmed at 'BB-'. The credit ratings reflect
weak monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) credibility, high inflation, low external liquidity
in the context of high financing requirements and geopolitical risks.
