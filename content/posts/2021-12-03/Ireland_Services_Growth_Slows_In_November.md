Ireland's service sector growth eased in November amid an increase in
fresh [coronavirus][1] infections, survey data from IHS Markit showed on
Friday.

The AIB Ireland services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 59.3 in
November from 63.4 in September. Any reading above 50.0 indicates
expansion in the sector.

"The AIB Irish Services PMI for November showed the sector registering
another strong increase in [business][2] activity, though the pace of
growth moderated with the rise in new Covid case numbers," AIB Chief
Economist Oliver Mangan said.

New business rose for the ninth month in a row in November, while growth
eased for the third time in four months to the weakest since April.

New export business rose at the slowest pace since June and new work
rose slowly in November.

Backlogs of work eased in November, but remained sharpest in the survey
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The overall rate of job creation eased to the lowest in six
months.

The composite output index, covering manufacturing and services,
decreased to 59.3 in November from 62.5 in the previous month.
