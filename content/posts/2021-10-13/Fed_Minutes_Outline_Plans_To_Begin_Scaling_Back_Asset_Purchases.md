The Federal Reserve on Wednesday released the minutes of its September
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, shedding some additional light on the central
bank's assessment that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may
"soon be warranted."

The minutes revealed participants generally agreed that a gradual
tapering of asset purchases that concludes around the middle of next
year would likely be appropriate if the economic recovery remained
broadly on track.

Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases
occurred at the Fed's next meeting in early November, the process of
tapering could begin with the monthly purchase [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)s beginning in
either mid-November or mid-December.

The meeting also included a discussion on how slowing the current rate
of bond purchases of $120 billion per month might proceed.

The minutes highlighted an "illustrative path" that features monthly
reductions of $10 billion in the purchase of Treasury securities and $5
billion in the purchase of agency mortgage-backed securities.

Participants noted that the Fed could adjust the pace of the moderation
of its purchases if economic developments were to differ substantially
from what they expected.

However, the minutes showed several participants preferred to proceed
with a more rapid moderation of purchases than described in the
illustrative examples.

The Fed has repeatedly indicated asset purchases would remain at the
current pace until "substantial further progress" has been made toward
the central bank's maximum employment and price stability goals.

At the meeting, most participants remarked that the standard of
"substantial further progress" had been met with regard to the price-
stability goal or that it was likely to be met soon.

A number of participants felt the standard of "substantial further
progress" toward the goal of maximum employment had not yet been reached
but would be soon if the [economy][1] proceeded roughly as anticipated.

Others felt the test of "substantial further progress" toward maximum
employment had been met on the basis of the cumulative performance of
the labor market since December 2020.

Some of these participants suggested labor supply constraints were the
main impediments to further improvement in labor market conditions and
noted adding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation would not address such
constraints.

A note from Capital Economics said the minutes "make it clear" that the
Fed will announce tapering plans at its next meeting scheduled for
November 2nd and 3rd.

"The scheduled monthly reductions could, in theory, be sped up or down
at a later date, but we suspect the bar to doing so will be pretty
high," Capital Economics said. "The Fed will essentially be putting the
taper on 'automatic pilot,' which is similar to what it did with the
balance sheet run off that began in 2017."

Meanwhile, the minutes stressed that the "substantial further progress"
standard regarding asset purchases was distinct from the criteria needed
to begin raising interest rates.

The Fed said a shift toward tapering asset purchases provides no direct
signal about interest rate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which would be based on a different
and more stringent test concerning economic conditions.
