Australia will on Thursday release September figures for unemployment,

August, while the Australian [economy][1] is tipped to shed 137,500 jobs
after losing 146,300 jobs in the previous month. The participation rate
is expected to fall to 64.7 percent from 65.2 percent.

Singapore will see an advance estimate for Q3 gross domestic product; in
the previous three months, GDP was down 1.8 percent on quarter and up
14.7 percent on year.

China will see September numbers for consumer and producer prices. CPI
is expected to rise 0.3 percent on month and 0.9 percent on year, up
from 0.1 percent on month and 0.8 percent on year in August. PPI is
called higher by an annual 10.5 percent, accelerating from 9.5 percent a
month earlier.

Japan will provide final August figures for industrial production; the
previous reading suggested a decline of 1.5 percent on month and an
increase of 11.6 percent on year.
