in September to the highest level since 1993, final data from Destatis
showed on Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 4.1 percent in September from 3.9
percent in August. The annual rate came in line with the flash estimate
published on September 30.

The latest inflation was the highest since December 1993, when the price
growth was 4.3 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices remained unchanged, as initially
estimated, in September.

EU harmonized inflation advanced to 4.1 percent from 3.4 percent in the
previous month. Month-on-month, the harmonized consumer prices gained
0.3 percent.

The statistical office confirmed the preliminary estimates published on
September 30.
