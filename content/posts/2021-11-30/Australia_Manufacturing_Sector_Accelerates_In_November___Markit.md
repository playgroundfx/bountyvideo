The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in November,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 59.2.

That's up from 58.2 in October and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This marks the eighteenth straight month in which the sector grew and at
the third-fastest rate on record.

A further easing of COVID-19 restrictions boosted market confidence and
enabled demand to rise at a stronger pace in November. In turn,
production likewise ramped up according to the latest survey results.

New export orders improved as well with COVID-19 restrictions easing
abroad, though the rate of growth fell amidst ongoing shipping issues.
