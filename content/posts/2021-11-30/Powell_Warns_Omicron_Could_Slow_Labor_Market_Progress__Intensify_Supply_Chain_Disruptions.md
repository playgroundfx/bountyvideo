With the Omicron variant of the [coronavirus][1] making headlines,
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to appear before the Senate
Banking Committee on Tuesday to discuss the pandemic and the CARES Act.

In prepared remarks, Powell said the recent surge in new Covid-19 cases
and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to
employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for
inflation.

"Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people's willingness to
work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and
intensify supply-chain disruptions," Powell said.

The potential for the intensification of supply-chain disruptions comes
as Powell noted pandemic-related supply and demand imbalances have
contributed to notable price increases in some areas.

"Supply chain problems have made it difficult for producers to meet
strong demand, particularly for goods," Powell said. "Increases in
energy prices and rents are also pushing inflation upward."

He added, "As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2
percent longer-run goal, with the price index for personal consumption
expenditures up 5 percent over the 12 months ending in October."

Powell noted most forecasters, including at the Fed, expect inflation to
slow significantly as supply and demand imbalances abate but predicted
the factors pushing prices higher will linger well into next year.

"We understand that high inflation imposes significant burdens,
especially on those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials
like food, housing, and transportation," Powell said.

He added, "We are committed to our price-stability goal. We will use our
tools both to support the [economy][2] and a strong labor market and to
prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched."

Powell will also tell the committee increases in Delta variant cases
contributed to slower economic growth this past summer, but a post-
September decline in cases corresponded to a pickup in growth.

"Gross domestic product appears on track to grow about 5 percent in
2021, the fastest pace in many years," Powell said in prepared remarks.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden recently announced his intent to nominate
Powell for a second term as Federal Reserve Chair.

The White House also revealed that Biden intends to nominate current Fed
Governor Lael Brainard as Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve System.

In early November, the Fed announced plans to begin reducing its $120
billion in monthly bond purchases by $15 billion per month, citing the
substantial further progress the economy has made toward its goals of
maximum employment and price stability.

During his testimony, Powell suggested the Fed will discuss accelerating
the pace at which it reduces its asset purchases during the next
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting scheduled for December 14-15.

"At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures
are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider
wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases â€¦ perhaps a few months
sooner," Powell said.

Powell also indicated the Fed should retire the word "transitory" when
referring to inflation, noting the central bank views it as meaning not
leaving a lasting mark on the economy rather than short-lived.
