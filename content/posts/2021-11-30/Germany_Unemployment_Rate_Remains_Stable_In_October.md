Germany's unemployment rate remained unchanged in October, data released
by Destatis showed on Tuesday.

The jobless rate held steady at seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent in
October, according to calculations based on the labor force survey. The
number of unemployed totaled 1.40 million, which was a decline of 17,700
or 1.2 percent from the previous month.

On an unadjusted basis, unemployment fell by 305,000 or 18.9 percent
from the last year to 1.31 million.

Data showed that the number of persons in employment rose by 122,000 or
+0.3 percent on September 2021. This month-on-month increase was higher
than the average recorded for October of the three pre-crisis years 2017
to 2019.

The Federal Labor Agency is scheduled to issue unemployment figures for
November today. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall marginally to
5.3 percent from 5.4 percent in October.
