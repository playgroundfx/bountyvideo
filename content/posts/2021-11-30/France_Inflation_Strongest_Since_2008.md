France inflation accelerated to the highest level since 2008 driven by
surging energy prices, the provisional estimate from the statistical
office Insee showed on Tuesday.  
  
In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office also confirmed the
sequential growth for the third quarter.

Consumer price inflation advanced to 2.8 percent in November from 2.6
percent in October. The rate was expected to remain unchanged at 2.6
percent.

The latest inflation was the strongest since September 2008, when prices
were up 3 percent.

The annual increase was driven by the acceleration in energy prices,
manufactured goods prices and services cost.  
  
French inflation will continue to rise in the coming months due to
energy prices, production line constraints that continue to push up
producer prices, Charlotte de Montpellier, an economist at ING said.

Month-on-month, consumer prices moved up 0.4 percent, the same rate as
seen in October. The rate was forecast to ease to 0.2 percent.

Inflation, based on the harmonized index of consumer prices, climbed to
3.4 percent from 3.2 percent a month ago. Economists had forecast the
HICP to gain 3.2 percent again in November.

On a monthly basis, the HICP grew 0.4 percent, the same rate as in
October. Final data is due on December 15.

Another report from Insee showed that producer price inflation advanced
to 14.9 percent in October from 11.7 percent in September. Compared to
September, producer prices gained 2.9 percent after rising 1.7 percent.

Revised data from Insee showed that the GDP growth estimate for the
third quarter improved notably to 3.0 percent from +1.3 percent in the
second quarter. The growth rate remained unchanged from the first
estimate published back in late October.

In October, household consumption decreased unexpectedly by 0.4 percent
and remained below its pre-crisis level.

This decline was mainly due to a sharp drop of 1.8 percent in
consumption of manufactured goods. It was partially offset by the 0.7
percent rise in consumption of food and 1 percent increase in spending
on energy.
