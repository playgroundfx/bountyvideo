MNI Indicators released a report on Tuesday showing a slowdown in the
pace of growth in Chicago-area [business][1] activity in the month of
November.

The report said the Chicago business barometer slid to 61.8 in November
from 68.4 in October, although a reading above 50 still indicates
growth. Economists had expected the business barometer to edge down to
67.0.

The bigger than expected decrease by the business barometer reflected a
slowdown in new orders, with the new orders index pulling back to the
February level of 58.2.

The employment index also fell to 51.6, reversing October's gain, as
firms struggled to find qualified workers to meet vacancies.

MNI Indicators said the prices paid index also edged down to 93.8 but
noted the reading was just shy of October's multi-decade high as firms
continued to report higher costs for production materials.

The report said the order backlogs index dropped below the 12-month
average, as firms reported a reduction in the size of incoming orders.

Meanwhile, the inventories index climbed to the highest level since the
fall of 2018, with some firms stockpiling to get ahead of further supply
chain disruptions and counteract logistical issues.

MNI Indicators noted the month's special question asked if firms are
seeing any easing up in the supply chain blockages. The vast majority,
64.9 percent, said "No," while 24.3 percent said "Somewhat."

A second questioned asked whether firms are managing to pass higher
costs onto customers, with 78.4 percent saying they were at least
partially managing to pass costs onwards.
