Turkey's economic growth moderated in the third quarter, the Turkish
Statistical Institute said on Tuesday.

Gross domestic product grew 7.4 percent year-on-year in the third
quarter, following the second quarter's 22 percent expansion.  
  
On a quarterly basis, GDP expanded by seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent
after rising 1.5 percent in the preceding period.

Turkey's [economy][1] put in another strong performance in the third
quarter but, as the effects of the recent currency crisis filter
through, it is likely to suffer a contraction in the fourth quarter,
Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The only crumb of comfort is that the downturn is likely to prove less
severe than that which followed the 2018 crisis, the economist added.
