Due to the effect of COVID-19 on tourism, we are unable to release
seasonally adjusted figures for the hospitality industry. As such, we
are focusing on the actual hospitality values for the June 2021
publication. We will continue to monitor this approach as more data
becomes available.

The hospitality industry rose NZ$161 million (17 percent) between June
2020 and June 2021.
