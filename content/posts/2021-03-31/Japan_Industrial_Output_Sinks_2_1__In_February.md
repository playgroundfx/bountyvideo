Industrial production in Japan was down a seasonally adjusted 2.1
percent on month in February, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry said on Wednesday.

That was shy of expectations for a fall of 1.2 percent following the 4.3
percent jump in January.

On a yearly basis, industrial production shed 2.6 percent - roughly in
line with expectations - after sinking 5.2 percent in the previous
month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI maintained its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it continues to pick up.
