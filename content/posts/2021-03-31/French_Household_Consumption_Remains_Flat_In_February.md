French household spending remained stable in February as the increase in
manufactured goods was offset by a drop in energy expenditure and food
consumption, the statistical office Insee said Wednesday.

Household consumption showed nil growth in February after falling by
revised 4.9 percent in January. Economists had forecast a 2 percent rise
for February.

Driven by the rebound in durable goods consumption and clothing sales,
manufactured goods consumption advanced 3.4 percent. Meanwhile, food and
energy consumption decreased 2.2 percent and 3.1 percent respectively.
