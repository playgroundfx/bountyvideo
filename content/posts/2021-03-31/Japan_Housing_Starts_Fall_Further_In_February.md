Japan housing starts continued to decline in February, data from the
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism showed on
Wednesday.

Housing starts decreased 3.7 percent year-on-year in February, bigger
than the 3.1 percent fall in January and 4.8 percent decline expected by
economists.

Annualized housing starts increased to 808,000 in February from 801,000
in January.

Further, construction orders received by the big 50 contractors grew at
a much slower pace of 2.5 percent after increasing 14.1 percent in
January. This was the second consecutive increase.
