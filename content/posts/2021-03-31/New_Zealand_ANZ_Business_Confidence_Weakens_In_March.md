New Zealand [business][1] confidence weakened more than initially
estimated in March, survey results from ANZ showed on Wednesday.

The business confidence index fell to -4.1 in March from 7.0 in
February. The flash reading was 0.0.

Business confidence as well as activity indicators ticked down in March,
consistent with the view that the [economy][2] would start to struggle a
bit more as the lack of tourists reached its seasonal cash-flow peak
impact and the unsustainable bounce in retail spending started to
dissipate, ANZ said.

Firms' own activity outlook fell 4 points to 17 percent in March. While
investment intentions declined 4 points, employment intentions advanced
4 points. Capacity utilization was largely unchanged at 14.6 percent.

Inflation pressure remained high. Cost expectations rose 1 point to a
net 73.3 percent of respondents reporting higher costs. At the same
time, a net 47.3 percent intend to raise their prices, a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly
very high level.
