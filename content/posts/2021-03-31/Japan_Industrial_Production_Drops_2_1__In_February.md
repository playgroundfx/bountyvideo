Industrial output in Japan fell a seasonally adjusted 2.1 percent on
month in February, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on
Wednesday.

That was shy of expectations for a fall of 1.2 percent following the 4.3
percent jump in January.

On a yearly basis, industrial production shed 2.6 percent - roughly in
line with expectations - after sinking 5.2 percent in the previous
month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI maintained its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it continues to pick up.

Industries that contributed to the decline included motor vehicles,
electrical machinery and chemicals, while production machinery and
transport equipment were up.

Shipments were down 1.5 percent on month and 3.5 percent on year thanks
to declines among motor vehicles, electrical machinery and other
manufacturing.

Inventories were down 1.0 percent on month and 9.6 percent on year
thanks to declines among motor vehicles, chemicals and electronic parts.

The inventory ratio was up 1.0 percent on month and down 4.8 percent on
year.

According to the METI's forecast for industrial production, output is
expected to have fallen 1.9 percent in March but then spike 9.3 percent
in April.

Industries contributing to the decline in March include production
machinery, [business][1]-oriented machinery and electrical machinery.

Industries contributing to the jump in April include production
machinery, electrical machinery and business-oriented machinery.
