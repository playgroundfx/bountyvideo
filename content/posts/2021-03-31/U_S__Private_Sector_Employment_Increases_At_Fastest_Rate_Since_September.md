Partly reflecting a jump in employment in the leisure and hospitality
industry, payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing
strong private sector job growth in the month of March.

ADP said private sector employment surged up by 517,000 jobs in March
after climbing by an upwardly revised 176,000 jobs in February.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 550,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 117,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The increase in private sector employment in March reflected the
strongest job growth since the spike of 821,000 jobs seen last
September.

The report said employment in the service-providing sector shot up by
437,000 jobs, partly reflecting an increase of 169,000 leisure and
hospitality jobs.

Employment in the goods-producing sector also climbed by 80,000 jobs
amid job growth in both the manufacturing and construction industries.

"Job growth in the service sector significantly outpaced its recent
monthly average, led with notable increase by the leisure and
hospitality industry," said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson.

She added, "This sector has the most opportunity to improve as the
[economy][1] continues to gradually reopen and the vaccine is made more
widely available."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly jobs report, which includes both public and private
sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 639,000 jobs in March
after climbing by 379,000 jobs in February. The unemployment rate is
expected to drop to 6.0 percent from 6.2 percent.
