The total number of building permits issued in Australia was up a
seasonally adjusted 21.6 percent on month in February, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday - coming in at 19,422.

That beat expectations for a gain of 5.0 percent following the 19.4
percent slide in January.

Private sector houses rose 15.1 percent to 13,939, while private sector
dwellings excluding houses increased 45.3 percent.

Total dwelling approvals rose in Queensland (40.5 percent), Tasmania
(31.6 percent), Victoria (21.7 percent), Western Australia (19.1
percent) and New South Wales (16.1 percent). Dwelling approvals fell in
South Australia (3.4 percent).

The seasonally adjusted estimate for the value of non-residential
building approved rose 27.5 percent.
