The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in March, and at a
faster rate, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 51.9.

That beat expectations for 51.0 and was up from 50.6 in February, moving
further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from
contraction.

The NBS also said its non-manufacturing PMI came in at 56.3, up sharply
from 51.4 in the previous month.
