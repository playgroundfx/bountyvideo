The UK [economy][1] grew more than previously estimated in the fourth
quarter but the overall contraction for the whole year of 2020 was the
biggest on record, data from the Office for National Statistics showed
on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent sequentially in the fourth
quarter instead of +1 percent estimated initially. The economy had
expanded sharply by 16.9 percent in the third quarter.

The level of GDP was still 7.3 percent below its fourth quarter of 2019,
revised from the previous estimate of 7.8 percent.

Over the whole year of 2020, GDP contracted by 9.8 percent, slightly
revised from the first estimate of a 9.9 percent decline. This was the
biggest contraction on record.

On the production side, there have been increases in services,
production and construction output. Services output grew by an upwardly
revised 1 percent and production output gained 2 percent. Construction
output advanced by downwardly revised 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that there was an increase in real
government expenditure of 6.7 percent, particularly driven by healthcare
and education expenditure.

There was an increase in gross fixed capital formation and inventories
in the quarter, while household consumption posted a slight fall of 1.7
percent in the quarter.

Gross fixed capital formation grew by a revised 4.4 percent and
[business][2] investment increased by an upward revised 5.9 percent in
the fourth quarter.
