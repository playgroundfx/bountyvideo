The Netherlands' retail sales decreased for a third straight month in
February, but at a slower pace, figures from the statistical office CBS
showed Wednesday.  
  
Retail sales decreased 2.8 percent year-on-year after a 6.0 percent
slump in the previous month. Sales decreased 3.4 percent in December.

Sales volume decreased 4.5 percent compared to a year ago.  
  
The latest decline was largely due to the continuing strict lockdown
measures to battle thatcoronavirus pandemic that severely hurt sales in
the non-food sector. Non-food store sales plummeted 30.3 percent.  
  
Food store sales grew 8.7 percent from a year ago.  
  
Online sales jumped 103.7 percent annually, which was the strongest
growth since the series began in January 2014.  
  
Without working-day adjustments, retail sales fell 5.7 percent year-on-
year.
