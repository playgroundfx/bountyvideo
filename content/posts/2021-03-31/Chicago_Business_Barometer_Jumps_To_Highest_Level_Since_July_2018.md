A report released by MNI Indicators on Wednesday showed a much bigger
than expected acceleration in the pace of growth in Chicago-area
[business][1] activity in the month of March.

MNI Indicators said its Chicago business barometer soared to 66.3 in
March from 59.5 in February, with a reading above 50 indicating growth
in regional business activity. Economists had expected the index to inch
up to 60.7.

With the much bigger than expected increase, the Chicago business
barometer reached its highest level since July of 2018.

The spike by the Chicago business barometer was led by a jump by the
production index, which surged up by 10.1 points to a three-year high of
72.0.

The new orders index also climbed by 7.1 points to 62.3, while the
employment index rose by 5.5 points to 54.6, reaching expansion
territory for the first time since June of 2019.

MNI Indicators also said prices paid at the factory gate escalated for
the seventh month in a row, with the prices paid index reaching its
highest level since August of 2018.
