Japan will on Monday release final Q1 figures for gross domestic
product, highlighting a busy day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

GDP is expected to fall 0.5 percent on quarter and 2.1 percent on year,
which represents an upward revision from last month's preliminary
reading that suggested a quarterly drop of 0.9 percent and a yearly
decline of 3.4 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GDP was down 1.9
percent on quarter and 7.3 percent on year.

Japan also will see May figures for bank lending and April numbers for
current account and the eco watchers survey. Bank lending was up 3.0
percent on year in April.

The current account is predicted to show a surplus of 480 billion yen,
down from 1,917.0 billion in March. The eco watchers survey for current
conditions saw a score of 7.9 in the previous month, while the outlook
was at 16.6.

Thailand will provide April numbers for unemployment; in March, the
jobless rate was 1.0 percent.

The Philippines will see April data for its retail price index; in
March, the index was up 1.1 percent on year.

Taiwan will release April figures for imports, exports and trade
balance. Imports are expected to fall 2.10 percent on year after adding
0.5 percent in March. Exports are called lower by an annual 4.73 percent
after easing 1.3 percent in the previous month. The trade surplus is
pegged at $3.139 billion, up from $2.27 billion a month earlier.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Australia are closed on Monday for the
queen's birthday and will reopen on Tuesday.
