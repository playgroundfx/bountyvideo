India's service sector logged its record fall in April as measures to
stem the spread of the [coronavirus][1] caused output and demand to fall
at unprecedented rates, survey results from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index plunged to 5.4 in April from
49.3 in March. The score signaled the most severe contraction in output
since records began in 2005.  
  
Activity fell severely as a result of the nationwide lockdown, leading
businesses to shut down their operations as demand collapsed.

Demand for services fell at the sharpest rate in over 14 years of data
collection. The [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly marked decline in new orders led to a large
rise in spare capacity.  
Due to lower [business][2], some services companies reduced employment.

Looking ahead, latest survey data signaled a further erosion of business
confidence. Expectations towards future output slumped for a second
successive month to their weakest since December 2015.

Indian service providers recorded a sharp drop in operating costs which
was the strongest since data collection began in December 2005.
Consequently, firms were able to reduce their fees in an effort to
stimulate sales.

At 7.2, the composite output index sank to a new record low from 50.6 in
March as the downturn was severe across both sectors in April.

Historical comparisons with GDP data suggest that India's [economy][3]
contracted at an annual rate of 15 percent in April, Joe Hayes, an
economist at IHS Markit, said.
