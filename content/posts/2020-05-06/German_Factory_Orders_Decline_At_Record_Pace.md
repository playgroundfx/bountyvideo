Germany's factory orders declined the most since the records began in
1991, due to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, data published by Destatis
revealed Wednesday.

Factory orders declined sharply by 15.6 percent on a monthly basis in
March, much bigger than the 1.2 percent drop logged in February.

This was the biggest fall since January 1991. Economists had expected a
10 percent decrease.

Domestic orders decreased 14.8 percent and foreign orders fell 16.1
percent in March from the previous month.

On a yearly basis, factory orders were down 16 percent, in contrast to a
1.9 percent rise in February.  
  
Data showed that turnover in manufacturing declined 11.5 percent month-
on-month in March versus an increase of 0.5 percent in February.
