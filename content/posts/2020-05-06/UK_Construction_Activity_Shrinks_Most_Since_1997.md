The UK construction sector contracted at the sharpest pace since the
survey began in 1997 amid site closures due to the [coronavirus][1], or
covid-19, pandemic, survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction
Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 8.2 in April from 39.3 in March. A
score below 50 indicates contraction. The expected score was 22.0.

This was the lowest score since data was first collected in April 1997.
The previous record low was 27.8 in February 2009.

All three main categories of construction work experienced a survey-
record fall in April, with declines in house building and commercial
activity exceeding that for civil engineering.

The latest lengthening of average lead times for the delivery of
construction products and materials was by far the steepest on record.
The decline in new [business][2] volumes was also the sharpest since the
survey began.

Construction firms reported that staffing decreased sharply in April,
with employees often placed on furlough until work on site could
recommence.

Business expectations for the year ahead dropped slightly since March
and equaled the survey-record low seen in October 2008.

Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said the prospect of severe
disruption across the supply chain will continue over the longer-term
and widespread use of the government job retention scheme has been
needed to cushion the impact on employment.
