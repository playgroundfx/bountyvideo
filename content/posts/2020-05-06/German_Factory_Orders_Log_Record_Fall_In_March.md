Germany's factory orders declined the most since the records began in
1991, as measures to contain the spread of [coronavirus][1], or
covid-19, pandemic dampened both domestic and foreign demand.

Factory orders declined sharply by 15.6 percent on a monthly basis in
March, much bigger than the 1.2 percent drop posted in February, data
published by Destatis revealed Wednesday.

This was the biggest fall since January 1991 and also larger than the
expected decrease of 10 percent.

Domestic orders slid 14.8 percent and foreign orders fell 16.1 percent
from the previous month.

Excluding major orders, new orders in manufacturing were 15.5 percent
lower than in the previous month.

On a yearly basis, overall factory orders decreased 16 percent, in
contrast to a 1.9 percent rise in February.

Data showed that turnover in manufacturing declined 11.5 percent month-
on-month in March versus an increase of 0.5 percent in February.

The [economy][2] ministry said a sharp decline in production next month
can be expected due to covid-19 pandemic.

The statistical office is scheduled to issue industrial production data
for March. Economists expect output to fall 7.4 percent on month,
reversing a 0.3 percent rise in February.

Elsewhere, Purchasing Managers' survey showed that the downturn in the
German private sector deepened in April.

The covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns led to record decreases
in both manufacturing and services output. The composite output index
posted a historic low of 17.4, down from the previous record of 35.0 in
March and the flash reading of 17.1.

The services PMI came in at an all-time low 16.2 versus 31.7 in the
previous month. The initial reading was 15.9.

Nonetheless, the decline in Germany's economy has been less severe than
in France, Italy and Spain, where lockdowns have been more strict, Phil
Smith, a principal economist at IHS Markit said.
