The private sector in Singapore continued to contract in April, and at a
faster rate, the latest survey from IHS Marketing revealed on Wednesday
with a record low PMI score of 28.1.

That's down from 33.3 in March, and it moves further beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, domestic demand and export demand continued to plummet
last month, although government subsidies alleviated cost pressures for
come businesses.

Supply chains came under intense pressure, with input delivery times
lengthening sharply during April. Staff shortages and difficulties
shipping items as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic reportedly
led to the deterioration in vendor performance.
