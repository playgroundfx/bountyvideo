The private sector in Hong Kong continued to contract in April, albeit
at a slightly slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Marketing revealed
on Wednesday with a PMI score of 36.9.

That's up from 34.9 in March, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 continue to
weigh heavily on sales, while [business][1] sentiment remains deeply
negative.

Deflationary pressures persist as overall business costs fell further
from March on a combination of lower paid prices for inputs and wage
savings (linked to redundancies and furloughed workers). At the same
time, firms provided discounts to boost sales, with selling prices
falling at a marked pace.
