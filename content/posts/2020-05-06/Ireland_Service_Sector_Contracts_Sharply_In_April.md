Ireland's service sector contracted in April indicating the fastest drop
in services output in the 20-year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), as the [economy][1]
shuts down to combat coronavirus, survey data from IHS Markit showed
Wednesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell by 18.6 points to 13.9 in
April. A score below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.

Activity levels were severely impacted by a record decline in new
[business][2] in April. Export business also dropped at a record pace.

Consequently, Irish service sector employment fell at the fastest rate
in the 20-year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in April.

The future activity sank to a new low since the series began in May 2000
as nearly half of the survey respondents reported that they expected a
decline from current levels.

The only survey indicators to avoid record lows in April were the two
price indices.

Nonetheless, average input prices still fell at the sharpest rate since
March 2010. Meanwhile, companies cut their own fees the most in seven
years in an attempt to bring in revenues amid the lockdown.

The survey showed that the Composite Output Index plunged 20 points to
17.3 in April, by far the lowest reading since the series was first
compiled in May 2000.
