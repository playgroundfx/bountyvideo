Sweden's services sector contracted in April at the fastest pace since
2009, due to COVID-19 pandemic, survey data from Swedbank and the
logistics association SILF showed on Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector decreased to 39.0
in April from 46.1 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction
in the sector.

"This is an exceptionally sharp decline, which indicates a rapidly
deteriorating service [economy][1] that we have never seen before in the
purchasing manager's index," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

The order intake sub-index registered the largest monthly decline in
April, followed by employment and [business][2] volume. Suppliers'
delivery times lengthened to the record level in April.

Companies' business volume plan index came in at 38.4 in April versus
38.0 in March. This was at [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low levels, which indicate a
reduced business volume over the next six months, the Swedbank reported.

The Composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, fell to
38.3 in April from 45.1 in the previous month.

This was the fourth lowest level in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) due to the
[coronavirus][3] pandemic and the global economic downturn leave deep
imprints in Swedish business, Kennemar said.
