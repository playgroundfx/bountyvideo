South Africa's manufacturing output declined further in September,
albeit at a softer pace, data from Statistics South Africa showed on
Tuesday.

Manufacturing output fell 2.6 percent year-on-year in September,
following an 11.1 percent decline in August.

The biggest negative contribution came mainly from basic iron and steel,
non-ferrous metal products, metal products and machinery, motor vehicles
trade and other transport equipment, wood industry, paper, publishing
and printing, and petroleum, chemical products, rubber and plastic
products.

On a month-on-month basis, manufacturing output rose 3.2 percent in
September, after a 3.3 percent growth in the preceding month.

During the three months ended in September, manufacturing output gained
32.9 percent, after a 21.0 percent increase in the preceding period.
