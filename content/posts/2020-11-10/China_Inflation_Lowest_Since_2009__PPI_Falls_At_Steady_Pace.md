China's consumer price inflation eased to the lowest since October 2009
as pork prices fell for the first time in 19 months, data from the
National Bureau of Statistics showed Tuesday.

Consumer price inflation slowed to an 11-month low of 0.5 percent in
October from 1.7 percent in September. This was also below economists'
forecast of 0.8 percent.

Pork prices decreased 2.8 percent on year in October after climbing 25.5
percent a month ago. This was the first fall in 19 months.

Excluding food and energy, core inflation held steady at 0.5 percent in
October.

Month-on-month, consumer prices dropped unexpectedly by 0.3 percent, in
contrast to a 0.2 percent rise in September. Prices were expected to
fall again by 0.2 percent.

Another report from the NBS showed that producer prices grew 2.1 percent
annually, the same rate of growth as logged in September. Economists had
forecast a 2 percent fall in October.

On a monthly basis, producer prices remained unchanged after a 0.1
percent rise in the previous month.

Consumer price inflation looks set to drop back further in the near-term
as pork supply continues to recover from last year's African swine fever
outbreak, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue at Capital Economics,
said.

However, the economists noted that demand-side price pressures are
likely to strengthen in the coming months given the rebound in
consumption and ongoing infrastructure-led stimulus.

Economists said [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are likely to look through the volatility
in food prices and focus on the recovery in underlying inflation. As
such, low headline inflation is likely to prevent the central bank from
raising interest rates next year.
