German economic confidence deteriorated sharply to a seven-month low in
November as financial experts were concerned about the economic impact
of the second wave of Covid-19, survey data from the ZEW - Leibniz
Centre for European Economic Research showed on Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment plummeted more-than-expected
17.1 to 39.0 points in November from 56.1 in October. The score was
forecast to fall to 41.7. This was the lowest since last April.

At the same time, the current conditions index dropped to -64.3 from
-59.5 a month ago. The expected reading was -65.0.

"Financial experts are concerned about the economic impact of the second
wave of COVID-19 and what this will entail," ZEW President Achim Wambach
said.

"The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment has therefore once again
significantly decreased in November, indicating a slowdown of economic
recovery in Germany," Wambach noted. There is also the additional worry
that the German [economy][1] could head back into recession.

"According to the assertions made by the experts, neither the Brexit
negotiations nor the outcome of the US presidential election currently
are having an impact on the economic expectations for Germany," ZEW
President added.

The financial market experts' sentiment concerning the economic
development of the euro area also showed a considerable decrease for the
second month in a row.

The corresponding indicator came in at 32.8 points in November, down by
19.5 points from the previous month. By contrast, the indicator for the
current economic situation rose slightly by 0.2 points to minus 76.4
points.
