The UK unemployment rate increased in the third quarter and redundancies
reached a record high, data from the Office for National Statistics
showed Tuesday.

The ILO jobless rate rose by 0.7 percentage points from the previous
quarter to 4.8 percent in three months to September, as economists'
expected.  
  
Meanwhile, the employment rate dropped by 0.6 percent from the preceding
quarter to 75.3 percent.

The employment rate has been decreasing since the start of the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, while the unemployment rate is rising
sharply. The number of people temporarily away from work has fallen
since its peak in April and May 2020.

Redundancies increased by a record 181,000 from the previous quarter to
a record high 314,000.  
  
Average earnings including bonus increased 1.3 percent annually, faster
than the expected increase of 1 percent. Likewise, earnings excluding
bonus grew 1.9 percent versus forecast of 1.5 percent.
