Belgium's industrial production rose in September from the previous
month, preliminary data from Statistics Belgium showed on Tuesday.

The seasonally adjusted industrial production index rose 0.5 percent
from August, the data showed.

However, production decreased from the same month last year in
September. Industrial production fell a [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted 4.6 percent
compared to a year ago.

"So compared to last year, September also registers a decrease of the
economic activity due to the Covid-19 pandemic," the statistical office
said.  
  
Survey data from the central bank last month showed that confidence
firmed up in the manufacturing sector in October and production capacity
utilization rate increased from July.
