The UK unemployment rate increased notably in the third quarter and
redundancies reached a record high as firms reduced staffing after the
government scaled back the furlough scheme, which was extended this
month till March-end next year.

Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the ILO jobless
rate rose by 0.7 percentage points from the previous quarter to 4.8
percent in the three months to September. This was the highest since
November 2016 and came in line with expectations.

The number of unemployed advanced by 243,000 persons from the prior
quarter to 318,000.

Meanwhile, the employment rate dropped 0.6 percentage points from the
preceding quarter to 75.3 percent.

The increase in unemployment suggests that the previous scaling back of
the furlough scheme took its toll, Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

Unless a vaccine significantly improves the outlook for activity,
employment is likely to fall by a total 6.0 percent, or 2 million, and
the unemployment rate will rise to a peak of 9 percent next year, the
economist noted.

The Bank of England estimated that about 5.5 million employees would be
furloughed in November.

Earlier this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the furlough scheme
until the end of March with employees receiving 80 percent of their
current salary for hours not worked.

The employment rate has been decreasing since the start of the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, while the unemployment rate is rising
sharply. The number of people temporarily away from work has fallen
since its peak in April and May this year.

Redundancies increased by 181,000 from the previous quarter to a record
high 314,000.

Data showed that vacancies continued to recover in the latest period but
were still below the levels seen before the impact of the coronavirus
pandemic. Vacancies grew by 146,000 from the last quarter.

Average earnings including bonus increased 1.3 percent annually, faster
than the expected increase of 1 percent. Likewise, earnings excluding
bonus grew 1.9 percent annually versus forecast of 1.5 percent.

In October, the claimant count declined 29,800 from the previous month.
The rate dropped to 7.3 percent from 7.4 percent in September.
