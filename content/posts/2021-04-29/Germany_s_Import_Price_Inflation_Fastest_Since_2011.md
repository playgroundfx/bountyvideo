Germany's import prices increased at the fastest pace in almost a decade
in March largely due to higher energy prices, Destatis reported on
Thursday.

Import prices grew 6.9 percent year-on-year in March, much faster than
the 1.4 percent rise in February. This was the fastest growth since
April 2011, when prices advanced 7.7 percent and also higher than
economists' forecast of 6 percent.

The acceleration in import price inflation was driven by the 56.7
percent rise in energy prices. Excluding energy, import price inflation
was only 3 percent.

Energy prices were extremely low in the comparable month last year when
demand fell significantly across Europe due to the Corona crisis, while
at the same time there was a strong excess supply.

Month-on-month, import prices advanced 1.8 percent after climbing 1.7
percent in February. Economists had forecast a monthly growth of 1
percent.

Data also showed that export prices grew at a faster pace of 2.2 percent
in March after rising 0.7 percent a month ago. On month, export prices
rose 0.8 percent compared to 0.5 percent in February.
