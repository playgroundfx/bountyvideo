China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, as widely expected, on
Tuesday.

The one-year loan prime rate was retained at 3.85 percent and the five-
year loan prime rate was maintained at 4.65 percent.

The one-year and five-year loan prime rates were last lowered in April
2020. The one-year loan prime rate was cut by 20 basis points and five-
year rate by 10 basis points last April.

Markets have expected the rates to remain on hold today as the People's
Bank of China had kept the rate on its medium-term lending facility
unchanged early this month.

The loan prime rate is fixed monthly based on the submission of 18
banks, though Beijing has influence over the rate-setting. This new
lending rate replaced the central bank's traditional benchmark lending
rate in August 2019.

"Given that official efforts to rein in credit are being achieved by
other means, we do not expect any changes to [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates in the coming
months," Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital
Economics, said.

With the [economy][1] doing well, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are now focused on
tackling financial risks, they noted.

Even in the absence of rate hikes, tighter credit conditions will become
an increasing headwind to economic activity over the coming quarters,
the economists added.
