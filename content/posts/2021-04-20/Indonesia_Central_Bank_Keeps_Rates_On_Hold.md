Indonesia's central bank decided to leave its key interest rates
unchanged to maintain the rupiah exchange rate stability amid the
downbeat economic outlook.

The Board of Governors of Bank Indonesia decided to retain the BI 7-day
reverse repo rate at 3.50 percent. The bank last reduced the rate by 25
basis points in February.

The deposit facility interest rate was kept at 2.75 percent, and the
lending facility rate at 4.25 percent.

Although the bank assessed improvements in exports, fiscal spending and
investment, the economic growth outlook was downgraded to 4.1-5.1
percent from 4.3-5.3 percent.

Inflation is forecast to remain under control within the 2-4 percent
target range in line with weak demand and adequate supply.

Looking forward, the bank forecast the current account deficit to remain
low at around 1.0 -2.0 percent of GDP in 2021.

The main concern for the central bank is the uncertain outlook for the
rupiah, which the Bank keeps a close eye on due to the country's high
level of foreign currency debt, Gareth Leather, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

Despite the downbeat outlook for the [economy][1], there is little room
for further rate cuts this year, the economist noted.
