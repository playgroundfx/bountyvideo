Taiwan's export orders logged a double-digit growth in March but the
pace of expansion slowed from February, the Ministry of Economic Affairs

Export orders advanced 33.3 percent year-on-year in March, smaller than
the 48.5 percent increase logged in February and 49.3 percent rise in
January.

On a monthly basis, export orders were up 26.0 percent in March.

Orders for transport equipments showed the biggest annual growth of 66.1
percent, followed by an increase of 61.8 percent in demand for plastics
and rubber articles. Orders for electronic products climbed 27.2
percent.

In the first quarter, export orders dropped 12.3 percent or US$20.95
billion from the preceding three months.
