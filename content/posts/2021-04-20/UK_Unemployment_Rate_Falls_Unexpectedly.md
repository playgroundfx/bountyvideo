Despite restrictions related to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the UK
unemployment rate dropped unexpectedly in the three months to February
as the government continues its job furlough scheme.

The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent in three months to February, data
from the Office for National Statistics showed on Tuesday. Economists
had forecast the rate to rise to 5.1 percent from 5 percent in three
months to January.

An estimated 1.67 million people were unemployed, down 50,000 on the
quarter. This was the first quarterly decrease since October to December
2019.

At the same time, the employment rate dropped 0.1 percentage points from
the previous quarter to 75.1 percent.

Employment may be closer to a trough than most people realize, Thomas
Pugh, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Even though a rise in the unemployment rate is expected, the bulk of
that will be driven by those who left the labor force returning, rather
than people losing their jobs, the economist said.

James Smith, an ING economist said, he still expects it to take some
time for employment to totally recover, and it is worth remembering that
the upheaval caused by the new EU-UK relationship will also add pressure
over time.

But barring any more Covid surprises, it is possible that the jobless
rate will gradually fall again by the end of the year, the economist
noted.

Annual growth in average employee pay continued to strengthen, the
growth was driven in part by compositional effects of a fall in the
number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs.

In three months to February, average earnings including bonus grew 4.5
percent annually, slower than the expected growth of 4.8 percent.
Meanwhile, excluding bonus, earnings advanced 4.4 percent, which was
bigger than the forecast of 4.2 percent.

In March, the claimant count rate held steady at 7.3 percent. The number
of people claiming unemployment benefits increased by 10,100 from
February.
