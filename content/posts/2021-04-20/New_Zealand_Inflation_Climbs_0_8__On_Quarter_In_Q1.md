Consumer prices in New Zealand were up a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent
on quarter in the first quarter of 2021, Statistics New Zealand said on
Wednesday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.7 percent following the
0.5 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2020.

On a yearly basis, consumer prices climbed 1.5 percent - again beating
forecasts for 1.4 percent, which would have been unchanged from the
three months prior.
