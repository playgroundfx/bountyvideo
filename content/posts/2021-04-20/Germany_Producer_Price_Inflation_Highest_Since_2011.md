Germany's producer prices increased in March at the fastest pace since
late 2011 driven by higher energy and intermediate product prices,
Destatis reported Tuesday.

Producer price inflation accelerated sharply to 3.7 percent in March
from 1.9 percent in February. This was the biggest increase since
November 2011 and faster than the expected rate of 3.3 percent.

Month-on-month, producer prices gained 0.9 percent versus a 0.7 percent
rise in the prior month. Economists had expected a 0.6 percent rise.

Energy prices increased 8.0 percent compared to March 2020 and the cost
of intermediate goods gained 5.7 percent, which was the biggest since
July 2011.  
  
Prices of durable consumer goods climbed 1.4 percent annually and that
of capital goods, such as machines and vehicles, by 0.9 percent.
Meanwhile, non-durable consumer goods prices decreased 1.4 percent.
