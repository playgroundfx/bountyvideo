Consumer prices in New Zealand climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent

Wednesday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.7 percent following the

Transport rose 3.9 percent, influenced by higher prices for private
transport supplies and services (up 4.9 percent) and purchase of
vehicles (up 2.6 percent).

Housing and household utilities rose 0.9 percent, influenced by actual
rentals for housing (up 1.0 percent) and home ownership (1.2 percent).

Alcoholic beverages and tobacco rose 1.6 percent, influenced by higher
prices for cigarettes and tobacco (up 2.7 percent).

Food rose 0.6 percent, influenced by grocery food (up 0.9 percent) and
restaurant meals and ready to eat foods (up 0.9 percent).

On a yearly basis, consumer prices climbed 1.5 percent - again beating
forecasts for 1.4 percent, which would have been unchanged from the
three months prior.

Housing and household utilities increased 2.6 percent, with higher
prices for home ownership (up 3.5 percent) and actual rentals for
housing (up 2.7 percent).

Food prices increased 1.1 percent, with higher prices for restaurant
meals and ready-to-eat foods (up 3.7 percent) and fruit and vegetables
(up 3.9 percent).

Alcoholic beverages and tobacco increased 2.5 percent, with higher
prices for cigarettes and tobacco (up 2.9 percent) and alcoholic
beverages (up 2.2 percent).

Miscellaneous goods and services increased 1.9 percent, with higher
prices for other miscellaneous services (up 6.1 percent).

For the year ended March 2021: CPI excluding food increased 1.6 percent;
CPI excluding housing and household utilities increased 1.2 percent; CPI
excluding alcoholic beverages and tobacco increased 1.4 percent; and CPI
excluding food group, household energy subgroup, and vehicle fuels
