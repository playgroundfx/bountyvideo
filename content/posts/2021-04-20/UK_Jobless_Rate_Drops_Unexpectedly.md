The UK unemployment rate dropped unexpectedly in three months to
February, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on
Tuesday.

The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent in three months to February.
Economists had forecast the rate to rise to 5.1 percent from 5 percent
in three months to January.

At the same time, the employment rate dropped 0.1 percentage points from
the previous quarter to 75.1 percent.

Annual growth in average employee pay continued to strengthen, the
growth was driven in part by compositional effects of a fall in the
number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs.

In three months to February, average earnings including bonus grew 4.5
percent annually and earnings excluding bonus advanced 4.4 percent.

In March, the claimant count rate held steady at 7.3 percent. The number
of people claiming unemployment benefits increased by 10,100 from
February.
