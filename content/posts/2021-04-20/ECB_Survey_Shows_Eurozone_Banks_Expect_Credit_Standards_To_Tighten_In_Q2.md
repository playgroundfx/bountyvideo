Eurozone banks expect credit standards to tighten and net demand for
loans to firms and households in the second quarter, results of a
quarterly survey by the European Central Bank showed Tuesday.  
  
The criteria for approving home loans eased slightly in the first
quarter, while the credit standards for consumer credit and other
lending to households tightened, the latest euro area bank lending
survey showed.  
  
Banks attributed the tightening mainly to risk perceptions related to
borrowers' creditworthiness and a lower risk tolerance.  
  
The easing of credit standards for home loans were largely due to
competitive pressure.

Banks expect expect credit standards to tighten for loans to firms and
households in the second quarter, the survey said.  
  
Demand for loans from firms declined further in the first quarters as
businesses in sectors more hit by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic
postponed their fixed investment plans.  
  
Meanwhile, the availability of liquidity buffers and direct government
support, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises, meant firms
did not demand additional loans for working capital.  
  
Demand for housing loans decreased in the first quarter mainly due to
weaker consumer confidence, while the low general level of interest
rates and housing market prospects continued to support underpin demand.  
  
The ECB survey showed that banks expect net demand to increase for loans
to firms and households in the second quarter.  
  
Further, the survey found that the ECB's asset purchase program, the
pandemic emergency purchase program and the third series of targeted
longer-term refinancing operations all had a positive impact on banks'
liquidity positions and market financing conditions.

The April 2021 BLS survey round was conducted between March 11 and 26.
