Japan's government lifted its economic view for the second straight
month as activity showed movements of picking up.

In the latest monthly report, released Wednesday, the Cabinet Office
said, "The Japanese [economy][1] is still in a severe situation due to
the Novel Coronavirus, but it is showing movements of picking up
recently."

The pick-up trend is expected to continue. However, attention should be
given to the risk that domestic and overseas infections would affect
economies.

Upgrading view on shipments, the government said exports are bottoming
out, although the influence of the infectious disease remains.

The office also raised its view on private consumption and industrial
production. The government observed that private consumption is picking
up recently and industrial production showed signs of picking up
recently in some sectors, although it is decreasing as a whole.
