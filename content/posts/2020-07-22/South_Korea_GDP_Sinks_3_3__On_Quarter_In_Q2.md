South Korea's gross domestic product was down a seasonally adjusted 3.3
percent on quarter in the second quarter of 2020, the Bank of Korea said
in Thursday's advance estimate.

That missed forecasts for a decline of 2.3 percent following the 1.3
percent contraction in the previous three months.

Real gross domestic income decreased by 2.0 percent on quarter.

On the expenditure side, private consumption was up 1.4 percent as
expenditures on durable goods increased. Government consumption rose 1.0
percent, with increased expenditures on goods. Construction investment
contracted 1.3 percent as building construction decreased. Facilities
investment fell 2.9 percent driven by a decrease in transportation
equipment.

Exports fell by 16.6 percent due to decreases in motor vehicles and coal
and petroleum products. Imports lost 7.4 percent owing to reduced
imports of crude oil.

On the production side, agriculture, forestry and fishing sank 9.7
percent, as crop yields declined. Manufacturing dropped 9.0 percent, due
to decreases in transportation equipment and computer and electronic and
optical products.

Electricity, gas and water supply added 2.8 percent, due to improvement
in generation efficiency despite a decrease in sales of electricity.
Construction eased 0.2 percent, owing to a decrease in building
construction.

Services shed 1.1 percent, mainly in wholesale and retail trade,
accommodation and food services, transportation and storage and cultural
and other services.

On a yearly basis, GDP was down 2.9 percent - again missing forecasts
for a fall of 2.0 percent after rising 1.4 percent in the three months
prior.
