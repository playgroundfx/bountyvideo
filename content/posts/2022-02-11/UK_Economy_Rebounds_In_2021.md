The UK [economy][1] expanded at the fastest pace since 1941 despite the
Omicron variant acting as a drag on growth towards the end of the year,
data from the Office for National Statistics showed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew by an estimated 7.5 percent in 2021, in
contrast to the sharp 9.4 percent contraction in 2020. This was the
biggest growth since 1941.

In December, GDP shrank 0.2 percent, reversing the revised 0.7 percent
growth in November.

Services were the main contributor to GDP's 0.2 percent fall in December
as output fell 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, production output increased 0.3
percent with growth in three out of the four sub-sectors. Manufacturing
gained 0.2 percent.

At the same time, construction output climbed 2.0 percent in December,
following an increase of 1.9 percent in November.

In the fourth quarter, GDP grew 1 percent sequentially, the same pace of
expansion as seen in the third quarter. Economists had forecast a
quarterly growth of 1.1 percent.  
  
Still the level of quarterly GDP in the fourth quarter was 0.4 percent
below its pre-[coronavirus][2] level.

On a yearly basis, GDP grew 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly
faster than the 6.4 percent expansion expected by economists.

When combined with the CPI inflation rate of 5.4 percent, the 0.2
percent fall in GDP in December meant that the economy experienced a
taste of stagflation at the end of last year, Paul Dales, an economist
at Capital Economics, said.

As it was driven by the Omicron COVID-19 wave which has now faded, the
fall in GDP will soon be reversed, the economist noted. "But high
inflation will be with us for longer and, together with the rise in
taxes in April, will restrain GDP growth this year."

Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade deficit
narrowed to GBP 12.35 billion in December from GBP 12.7 billion in
November.

The services surplus totaled GBP 10.01 billion versus GBP 10.11 billion
surplus in November.

As a result, overall trade balance, covering both goods and services,
showed a deficit of GBP 2.34 billion compared to a GBP 2.58 billion
deficit in the previous month.
