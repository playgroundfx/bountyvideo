Russia's central bank raised its key rate by 100 basis points citing
higher inflation.

The Board of Directors of Bank of Russia decided to lift the interest
rate to 9.50 percent from 8.50 percent. The decision came in line with
expectations.

The bank holds open the prospect of further key rate increase at its
upcoming meetings, the bank said in a statement.  
  
The board observed that the balance of risks has tilted even more
towards proinflationary ones. The central bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance
is aimed to return inflation to 4 percent, the bank said.

Given the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, the bank expects inflation to ease to
5.0-6.0 percent in 2022 and return to the target in the middle of 2023.

The [economy][1] is projected to grow 2.0-3.0 percent this year. The
annual growth rate will equal 1.5-2.5 percent next year and 2.0-3.0
percent in 2024.
