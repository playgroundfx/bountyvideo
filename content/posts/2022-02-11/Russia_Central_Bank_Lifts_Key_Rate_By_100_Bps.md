Russia's central bank raised its key rate by a full one percentage
points on Friday as inflation continued to stay well above the target.

The Board of Directors of Bank of Russia decided to lift the key
interest rate to 9.50 percent from 8.50 percent. The decision came in
line with expectations.

Signaling further rate hikes, the bank said "the bank holds open the
prospect of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings."

The board observed that inflation is developing appreciably above the
October forecast and the balance of risks has tilted even more towards
proinflationary ones.

The effect of proinflationary factors may be intensified by elevated
inflation expectations and corresponding secondary effects, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers
noted.

If inflation rise further in February, there is a possibility that the
central bank will opt for one more interest rate hike of 50-75 bps in
March, Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The central bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance is aimed to return inflation
to 4 percent, the bank said.

Given the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, the bank expects inflation to
ease to 5.0-6.0 percent in 2022 and return to the target in the middle
of 2023.

However, the projection for this year was revised up from 4.0 percent to
4.5 percent estimated in December.

According to the latest central bank forecast, the Russian [economy][1]
will return to its balanced growth path by the end of 2023.

The economy is projected to grow 2.0-3.0 percent this year. Further, the
annual growth rate will equal 1.5-2.5 percent next year and 2.0-3.0
percent in 2024.
