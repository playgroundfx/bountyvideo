The UK [economy][1] expanded at a steady pace in the fourth quarter, the
Office for National Statistics said on Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 1 percent sequentially, the same pace of
expansion as seen in the third quarter. Economists had forecast a
quarterly growth of 1.1 percent.  
  
Still the level of quarterly GDP in the fourth quarter was 0.4 percent
below its pre-[coronavirus][2] level.

On a yearly basis, GDP grew 6.5 percent, slightly faster than the 6.4
percent expansion expected by economists.

GDP expanded by an estimated 7.5 percent in 2021, following a 9.4
percent fall in 2020.

In December, GDP contracted 0.2 percent, in contrast to the revised 0.7
percent growth in November.

Services were the main contributor to GDP's 0.2 percent fall in December
as output fell 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, production output increased 0.3
percent with growth in three out of the four sub-sectors. Manufacturing
gained 0.2 percent.

At the same time, construction output climbed 2.0 percent in December,
following an increase of 1.9 percent in November.

Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade deficit
narrowed to GBP 12.35 billion in December from GBP 12.7 billion in
November.  
  
Overall trade balance, covering both goods and services, showed a
deficit of GBP 2.34 billion compared to a GBP 2.58 billion deficit in
the previous month.
