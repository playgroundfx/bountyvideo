The UK [economy][1] expanded only marginally in February as the growth
in services was almost offset by contractions in production and
construction.

Gross domestic product grew 0.1 percent month-on-month, much slower than
the 0.8 percent increase in January, the Office for National Statistics
said Monday. This was also weaker than the expected growth of 0.3
percent.

Monthly GDP was now 1.5 percent above its pre-[coronavirus][2] pandemic
level. GDP expanded 1.0 percent in three months to February.

On the production-side, services grew 0.2 percent, mainly driven by
tourism-related industries with increases in travel agency, tour
operator and other reservation services.

Meanwhile, industrial production shrank 0.6 percent, following a 0.7
percent rise in January. Manufacturing was the main driver of negative
growth, falling 0.4 percent in February.

Construction output decreased 0.1 percent in February after posting a
revised increase of 1.6 percent in January.

The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the economy was hardly growing at all in February suggests
the economy had a little less momentum in the first quarter than had
previously thought, and increases the risk of a contraction in GDP in
the coming months as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies,
Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

In a separate communiqu√©, the ONS said the visible trade deficit
declined in February as exports recovered amid a fall in imports.

The visible trade gap narrowed to GBP20.6 billion from GBP 23.9 billion
in the previous month. The expected level was GBP 20.0 billion.

Exports rebounded 7.8 percent on month, while imports dropped 2.5
percent in February.

The trade in services showed a surplus of GBP 11.33 billion versus a GBP
11.06 billion surplus in the prior month.

The overall trade deficit declined to GBP 9.3 billion from GBP 12.8
billion a month ago.
