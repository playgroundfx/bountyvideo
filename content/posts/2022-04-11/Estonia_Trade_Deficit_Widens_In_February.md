Estonia's trade deficit widened in February as imports rose faster than
exports, figures from Statistics Estonia showed on Monday.

The trade deficit increased to EUR 309.0 million in February from EUR
70.0 million in the same month last year. In January, the trade deficit
was EUR 176 million.

"The bigger trade deficit was primarily due to trade in mineral fuels,
where the value of imports grew significantly while exports remained at
last year's level," Evelin Puura, leading analyst at Statistics Estonia,
said.

Exports increased 18.0 percent yearly in February, after a 35.0 percent
growth in January.

Imports rose 35.0 percent annually in February, after a 37.0 percent
increase in the previous month.

The main export partners are Finland, Latvia and Sweden, and the import
partners are Finland, Lithuania and Russia.
