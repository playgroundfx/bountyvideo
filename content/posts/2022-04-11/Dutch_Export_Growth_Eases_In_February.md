The Netherland's exports and imports increased at a softer pace in
February, figures from the statistical office CBS showed on Monday.

Exports rose 2.8 percent yearly in February, after a 3.3 percent
increase in January. Exports grew for the fourth month in a row.

In February, in particular, more metal products and transport equipment
were exported, the agency said.

Citing its export radar, the CBS said conditions for exports in April
are less favorable than in February.

Imports increased 1.0 percent annually in February, after a 7.2 percent
growth in the previous month.
