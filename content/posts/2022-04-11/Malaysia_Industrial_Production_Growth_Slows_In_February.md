Malaysia's industrial production grew at a softer pace in February,
mainly due to the rise in manufacturing and electricity output, data
from the Department of Statistics showed on Monday.

Industrial production rose 3.9 percent year-on-year in February, after a
4.3 percent increase in January. Economists had expected a 4.0 percent
growth.

Growth was mainly driven by a rise in production of manufacturing and
electricity.

Manufacturing output grew 5.2 percent yearly in February, after a 6.8
percent increase in the previous month.

Among other sectors, electricity output rose 3.9 percent, while mining
and quarrying output decreased 0.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production fell 6.6 percent in February,
data showed.
