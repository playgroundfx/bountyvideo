The European Central Bank is ready to do whatever is necessary to
support the euro area through the economic shock created by the spread
of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic, ECB President Christine
Lagarde said Thursday.

"The Governing Council is committed to doing everything necessary within
its mandate to help the euro area through this crisis," Lagarde said in
a statement at the meeting of the International Monetary and Financial
Committee.  
  
"It is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase
programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for
as long as needed."

ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers will also "explore all [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) and all contingencies"
to support the Eurozone [economy][2] through the Covid-19 shock, she
added.  
  
Citing recent data, Lagarde said the Euro area is facing a "large
contraction in output" and "rapidly deteriorating labor [markets][3]".  
  
Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund projected that
Eurozone is set to witness a GDP decline of 7.5 percent this year. In
2021, the euro area economy is forecast to grow 4.7 percent.  
  
Italy, Spain and France are among the worst hit euro area member states.
The lender forecast a GDP decline of 9.1 percent this year for Italy,
the worst outcome in the developed world.

"Uncertainty is sharply elevated and will remain high, making it
extremely difficult to predict the likely extent and duration of the
imminent recession and subsequent recovery," the ECB chief said.  
  
The central bank expects headline inflation to fall further in the near
term. However, the impact of the coronavirus crisis for inflation are
surrounded by high uncertainty, Lagarde added.  
  
The stimulus already announced by the ECB include a sizeable EUR 1.1
trillion increase in the volume of asset purchases under the existing
Asset Purchase Programme and a newly created Pandemic Emergency Purchase
Programme, or PEPP.

The central bank has also offered longer term loans at cheaper rates,
mainly targeting small and medium enterprises, and also eased its
collateral rules to ensure ample liquidity in the financial system
during this period of crisis.  
  
Further, the ECB strengthened its swap line arrangements with several
other central banks to boost euro liquidity.  
  
ECB's stimulus measures have "an important stabilising impact" on the
euro area sovereign yield curve," ECB Executive Board member Isabel
Schnabel said in a speech on Thursday.  
  
"In a matter of days, the pandemic reversed the previous easing in
financial conditions that was consistent with a return of inflation to
our medium-term aim," she said.

"This threatened to unleash a perilous macro-financial feedback loop
that, if left unaddressed, would have put at risk the ECB's price
stability mandate and endangered financial stability more broadly."

The stimulus measures helped stabilize broad funding conditions in the
euro area, improve market liquidity and reduce volatility, Schnabel
noted.
