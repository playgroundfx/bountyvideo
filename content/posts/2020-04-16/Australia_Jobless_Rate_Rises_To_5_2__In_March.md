The unemployment rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 5.2
percent in March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

That was up from 5.1 percent in February, but it beat expectations for
5.4 percent.

The Australian [economy][1] added 5,900 jobs last month after collecting
26,700 jobs in February - but that was far better than forecasts that
suggested a loss of 30,000 jobs due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus.

The participation rate was steady at 66.0 percent, again beating
forecasts for 65.9 percent.
