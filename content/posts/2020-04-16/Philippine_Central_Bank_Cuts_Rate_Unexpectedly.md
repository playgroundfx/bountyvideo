The Philippine central bank reduced its key interest rate unexpectedly
on Thursday, to insulate the [economy][1] from the fallout from the
coronavirus, or COVID-19 pandemic.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, or BSP, slashed
the overnight reverse repurchase facility rate by 50 basis points to
2.75 percent, with effect from April 17.

This is to strongly encourage lending to various sectors, especially to
the most vulnerable, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Benjamin
Diokno said.

The monetary board was scheduled to hold its next meeting on May 21.

The overnight deposit and lending rates were also slashed by 50 basis
points each.  
The bank had lowered the benchmark rate by 50 basis points in March and
25 basis points in February.

Diokno had earlier suggested a deeper rate cut at off-cycle meeting to
support economy as measures to contain spread of virus resulted in huge
job losses and spending.

Nicholas Mapa, an ING economist expects Diokno to continue to ease
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), reducing reserve requirement by another 200 basis
points before the end of April and cutting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates by another 25
basis points by May.

Investors will continue to monitor the size and scope of the fiscal
Covid recovery plan now that the lockdown has been extended to the end
of the month with government officials flagging a worst case scenario
technical recession by the third quarter of the year, the economist
noted.
