Reflecting the impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released a report on Thursday showing a
substantial contraction in regional manufacturing activity in the month
of April.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity plunged to
a negative 56.6 in April from a negative 12.7 in March, with a negative
reading indicating a contraction in regional manufacturing activity.
Economists had expected the index to tumble to a negative 30.

Looking ahead, firms expect the current letup in manufacturing activity
to last less than six months, as the broadest indicator of future
activity strengthened further.
