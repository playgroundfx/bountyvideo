The jobless rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 5.2
percent in March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

That was up from 5.1 percent in February, but it beat expectations for
5.4 percent.

The Australian [economy][1] added 5,900 jobs last month after collecting
26,700 jobs in February - but that was far better than forecasts that
suggested a loss of 30,000 jobs due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus.

Full-time employment decreased 400 to 8,882,200 persons and part-time
employment increased 6,400 to 4,135,400 persons.

Unemployment increased 20,300 to 718,600 persons.

The participation rate was steady at 66.0 percent, again beating
forecasts for 65.9 percent.

Monthly hours worked in all jobs increased 8.6 million hours to 1,784.9
million hours.

The monthly seasonally adjusted underemployment rate increased 0.1 pts
to 8.8 percent. The monthly underutilization rate increased 0.2 pts to
14.0 percent.
