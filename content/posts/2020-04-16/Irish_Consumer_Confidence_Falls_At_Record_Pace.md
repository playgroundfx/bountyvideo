Ireland's consumer confidence weakened at the sharpest pace in twenty-
four year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in April, survey data from the KBC Bank Ireland
showed on Thursday.

The consumer confidence index fell to 42.6 in April from 77.3 in March.
In February, the reading was 85.2.

The latest monthly decline was the sharpest in the twenty four year
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in April reflecting a dramatic change both in the economic
conditions and household financial circumstances as a result of COVID-19
and the associated [health][1] related shutdown of substantial elements
of [business][2] and social activity, KBC Bank Ireland Chief Economist
Austin Hughes said.

The fall in consumer confidence was equivalent to about half the decline
seen in sentiment through the period when the [economy][3] moved from
boom to bust, Hughes added.

"The April reading suggests a sea-change in Irish consumers' thinking
about their economic circumstances in response to the Coronavirus,"
Hughes added.
