Indonesia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Tuesday
and lowered the growth forecast for this year amid high uncertainty in
the global [economy][1] and trade.

Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo announced that the Board of
Governors decided to leave the 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) at 3.50
percent. The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction
in February 2020.

The deposit facility interest rate was maintained at 2.75 percent and
the lending facility rate at 4.25 percent.  
  
The [domestic economic recovery][2], which improved late in the first
quarter due to increased mobility, is set to be partly damped in the
coming months by restrained export volumes in the backdrop of the war
between Russia and Ukraine, the bank said.  
  
The central bank lowered its economic growth projection for this year to
4.5-5.3 percent from 4.7-5.5 percent.  
  
The bank predicted [inflation to remain under control][3] within the
target of 3.0Â±1 percent, supported by the adequate supply in response to
rising demand, controlled inflation expectations, stability in the
Rupiah exchange rate, and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) responses.  
  
Looking ahead, the bank expects the balance of payments to remain
favorable and the rupiah exchange rate to remain stable, underpinned by
sound economic fundamentals such as a lower current account deficit.
