UK labor productivity recovered in the first quarter, data from the
Office for National Statistics showed on Wednesday.

Output per hour grew 0.9 percent quarter-on-year, following a 0.7
percent fall in the fourth quarter.

The ONS said total hours worked fell faster than gross value added,
resulting in more output per hour worked in the first quarter.

Output per hour was 0.5 percentage points above pre-[coronavirus][1]
levels.

Data showed that output per worker fell by 4.7 percent quarter-on-year,
reflecting workers retaining employment through the Coronavirus Job
Retention Scheme, while not producing output.
