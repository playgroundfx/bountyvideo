The services sector in Australia continued to expand in June, albeit at
a slower pace, the latest survey from the Australian Industry Group
revealed on Wednesday with a Performance of Services Index score of
57.8.

That's down from 61.2 in May, although it remains well above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

All five of the services sectors available in the Australian PSI in June
indicated expansion. All five activity indicators showed positive
results for the month, but sales, new orders and employment all eased
from the May reading.
