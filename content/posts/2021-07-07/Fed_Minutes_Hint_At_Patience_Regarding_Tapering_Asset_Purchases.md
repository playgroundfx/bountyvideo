With officials still seeing risks to the economic outlook, the minutes
of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting suggest the
central bank will not be in a hurry to begin scaling back its asset
purchase program.

The Fed has repeatedly said it plans to continue to its asset purchases
at a rate of at least $120 billion per month until "substantial further
progress" has been made toward its goals of maximum employment and price
stability.

The minutes of the June meeting reiterated Fed Chair Jerome Powell's
view that "substantial further progress" has not yet been met, although
participants expected progress to continue.

While various participants expect conditions for beginning to reduce the
pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than they had
previously anticipated, others saw incoming data as providing a less
clear signal about the underlying economic momentum.

The minutes said some participants determined the Fed would be able to
make a better assessment in the coming months and emphasized the central
bank should be "patient in assessing progress toward its goals and in
announcing changes to its plans for asset purchases."

At the same time, participants generally agreed that it was important
for the Fed to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases,
if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments.

The Fed said participants also agreed to continue assessing the
[economy][1]'s progress toward the central banks goals at coming
meetings and to begin to discuss their plans for adjusting the path and
composition of asset purchases.

"In addition, participants reiterated their intention to provide notice
well in advance of an announcement to reduce the pace of purchases," the
Fed said.

The Fed's next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting is currently scheduled for later
this month, with the two-day meeting set to get underway on July 27th.

The minutes also noted the near-term outlook for inflation was revised
up markedly, but the staff continued to expect the rise in inflation
this year to be transitory.

Meanwhile, projections provided following the conclusion of the two-day
meeting pointed to an increase in interest rates in 2023.

The latest projections from Fed officials suggest interest rates will be
increased to 0.6 percent in 2023 compared to previous projections
indicating rates would remain at near-zero levels.
