The European Commission upgraded the economic projections citing the
improving [health][1] situation and the ensuing continued easing of
virus containment measures.

According to the latest Summer Interim Forecast, economic output is
forecast to return to the pre-pandemic levels in the last quarter of
2021.

The euro area [economy][2] is forecast to grow 4.8 percent in 2021,
instead of 4.3 percent projected previously. Likewise, the outlook for
2022 was raised to 4.5 percent from 4.4 percent.

The forecast for inflation this year and next has also been revised
upwards, though retaining a hump-shaped profile. Inflation is projected
to increase throughout this year, driven by transitory factors.

In the euro area, inflation is forecast to average 1.9 percent in 2021
compared to 1.7 percent estimated in the Spring forecast. Similarly,
inflation forecast for next year was raised marginally to 1.4 percent
from 1.3 percent.
