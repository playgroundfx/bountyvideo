Germany's industrial production decreased unexpectedly in May as the
supply bottlenecks continued to weigh on the automotive sector, official
data revealed Wednesday.

Industrial production fell 0.3 percent month-on-month in May, the same
pace of decline as seen in April, data from Destatis showed on
Wednesday. Economists had forecast output to grow 0.5 percent after
April's initial estimate of -1 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial output growth moderated to 17.3 percent
from 27.6 percent a month ago.

Compared with February 2020, the month before restrictions were imposed
due to the corona pandemic in Germany, production was 5.0 percent lower
in seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

Excluding energy and construction, industrial production was down 0.5
percent.

Within industry, consumer goods output showed an increase of 4.1 percent
and the production of intermediate goods was up 0.6 percent. Meanwhile,
capital goods output dropped 3.4 percent.

Outside industry, energy production dropped 2.1 percent in May, while
construction output climbed 1.3 percent.

The [economy][1] ministry said the outlook for industrial activity as a
whole remains positive in the view of continued high demand as well as
significant improvements in the [business][2] climate and export
expectations.

While the auto sector is still not firing on all cylinders, the big
picture is that the rest of the manufacturing sector is doing reasonably
well, Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

In the latest Summer Forecast, published by EU on Wednesday, Germany's
GDP is expected to grow 3.6 percent in 2021 and 4.6 percent in 2022.
This is somewhat higher than projected in spring, largely due to the
faster improvement in the [health][3] situation and more favorable
trends in business confidence.
