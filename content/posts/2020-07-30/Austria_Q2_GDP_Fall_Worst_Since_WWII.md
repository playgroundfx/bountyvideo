Austria's economic output collapsed at a sharp rate in the second
quarter, thanks to the disruption caused by the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, pandemic, pushing the [economy][2] into a recession that is
the worst since the second world war, preliminary estimates from the
Austrian Institute of Economic Research, or WIFO, showed on Thursday.

Gross domestic product decreased 12.8 percent year-on-year following a
revised 2.8 percent decline in the first quarter, the think tank said.

Compared to the previous three months, GDP dropped 10.7 percent in the
second quarter after a 2.4 percent drop in the three months to March.

The measures to contain the pandemic and the gradual opening of trade
and service sectors between mid-April and the end of May had a decisive
impact on economic development, WIFO said.

The 27.8 percent year-on-year slump in the trade, maintenance and repair
of motor vehicles, transportation and storage, accommodation and food
service activities, deducted 5.4 percentage points from GDP. This was
responsible for almost half of the decline in GDP in the second quarter.

The sector that includes sports and recreation, arts and
[entertainment][3] as well as other personal services saw a 32 percent
annual fall in value added, leading to a 0.8 percentage points deduction
from GDP.

In the mining, manufacturing, energy and water supply and waste
management sectors, the value added fell 20.9 percent year-on-year and
in the construction industry, it recorded a decline of 9.2 percent from
last year.

Meanwhile, the information and communication, financial and insurance
activities, real estate and public administration sectors were resilient
to the crisis.

Household consumption shrank 15.9 percent year-on-year, while state
spending grew 1.9 percent. Gross capital formation decreased 13.5
percent with fixed investment falling 10.9 percent. Exports dropped 18.1
percent and imports fell 15.3 percent.
