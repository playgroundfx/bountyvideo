New Zealand [business][1] confidence improved less than initially
estimated in July, final data from ANZ showed Thursday.

The business confidence index rose -31.8 in July from -34.4 in June. The
preliminary reading was -29.8.

The survey showed that own activity, expected profitability, investment
intentions, capacity utilization, pricing intentions, ease of credit,
activity vs. a year ago, employment vs. a year ago were slightly weaker
than the preliminary reading.

Further, expected costs, employment intentions and inflation
expectations were similar to the preliminary reading.

Meanwhile, export intentions, residential construction intentions,
commercial construction intentions were stronger than the preliminary
estimate.

The rebound out of lockdown has been enthusiastic for retail, domestic
tourism, and the housing market, ANZ said.

The economic pain arising from the closed border and sharply weaker
global growth is yet to be fully felt - partly because an [economy][2]
is just a slow ship to turn, but partly because of the enormous fiscal
stimulus such as the wage subsidy scheme that is masking the real income
hit that the economy is experiencing, ANZ added.
