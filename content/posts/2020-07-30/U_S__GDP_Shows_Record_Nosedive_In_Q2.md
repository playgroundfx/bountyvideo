Reflecting the impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the Commerce
Department released a report on Thursday showing a record contraction in
U.S. economic activity in the second quarter.

The report said real gross domestic product plummeted at an annual rate
of 32.9 percent in the second quarter following a 5.0 percent slump in
the first quarter.

While GDP showed the biggest quarterly drop on record, the plunge was
not quite as steep as the 34.1 percent nosedive expected by economists.

The Commerce Department said the slump in GDP reflected decreases in
consumer spending, exports, private inventory investment, non-
residential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state
and local government spending.
