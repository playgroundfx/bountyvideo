Dutch producer confidence continued to improve for the third straight
month in July, data from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed on
Thursday.

The producer sentiment index rose to -8.7 in July from -15.1 in June.
This was below the average score of 0.5 seen over the past twenty years.

Producers remained negative about the stock of finished goods, while
their opinion on order book was less negative, the agency said.

Confidence level was less negative than in June. Producers in the wood
and building material industry were less positive.
