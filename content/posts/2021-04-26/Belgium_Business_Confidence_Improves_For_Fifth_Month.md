Belgium's [business][1] confidence improved sharply in April and for a
fifth consecutive month, survey data from the National Bank of Belgium
showed Monday.

The business confidence index climbed to 4.4 from -1.0 in the previous
month. Economists had expected the reading to weaken to -3.1.

The latest improvement was driven by stronger morale in the business
services, mainly information [technology][2], as well as manufacturing
and construction sectors.

The business services index rose 6.7 points and the measures for the
manufacturing sector and the construction industry climbed 5.6 points
each. The confidence index for the trade sector dropped 2.7 points.

The assessment of the current situation improved in the services sector
and entrepreneurs continued to be optimistic about the future outlook
for general market demand.

Manufacturers gave a more favorable assessment for the current
situation, especially for order book levels. They also revised upwards
the forecasts for employment and demand.

The main improvement in the assessment in the building industry was with
regards to demand prospects.

In the trade sector, forecasts for employment and for orders placed with
suppliers were revised downwards.

The survey also showed that the seasonally adjusted capacity utilization
rate climbed to 79.6 percent in April from 78.9 percent in January, thus
returning to its end-2019 level.
