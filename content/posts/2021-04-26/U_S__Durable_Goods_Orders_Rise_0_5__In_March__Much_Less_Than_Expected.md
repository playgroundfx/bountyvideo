A report released by the Commerce Department on Monday showed new orders
for U.S. manufactured durable goods increased by much less than expected
in the month of March.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in
March after falling by a revised 0.9 percent in February.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to spike by 2.5 percent
compared to the 1.2 percent slump that had been reported for the
previous month.

The much weaker than expected durable goods orders growth was partly due
to a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment.

Largely reflecting a sharp pullback in orders for non-defense aircraft
and parts, orders for transportation equipment tumbled by 1.7 percent in
March after plunging by 2.0 percent in February.

Excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods
orders jumped by 1.6 percent in March after dipping by 0.3 percent in
February. The increase matched economist estimates.

The rebound in ex-transportation orders reflected notable increases in
orders for fabricated metal products, primary metals and machinery.

The report also showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a key indicator of [business][1] spending, increased by 0.9
percent in March after falling by 0.8 percent in February.

Shipments in the same category, which is the source data for equipment
investment in GDP, jumped by 1.3 percent in March after slumping by 1.1
percent in the previous month.

"Taken together, the data confirm that business investment momentum re-
accelerated at the end of Q1 and is likely to provide positive support
to GDP growth," said Lydia Boussour, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics. "We forecast GDP growth of 9.0% annualized in Q1."
