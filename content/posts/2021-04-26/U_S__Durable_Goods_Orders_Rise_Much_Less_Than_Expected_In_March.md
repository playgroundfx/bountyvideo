A report released by the Commerce Department on Monday showed new orders
for U.S. manufactured durable goods increased by much less than expected
in the month of March.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in
March after falling by a revised 0.9 percent in February.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to spike by 2.5 percent
compared to the 1.2 percent slump that had been reported for the
previous month.

The much weaker than expected durable goods orders growth was partly due
to a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment.

Excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods
orders jumped by 1.6 percent in March after dipping by 0.3 percent in
February. The increase matched economist estimates.
