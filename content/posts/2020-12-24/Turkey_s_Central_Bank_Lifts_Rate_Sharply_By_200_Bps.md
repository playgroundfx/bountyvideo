Turkey's central bank resorted to another sharp rate hike on Thursday,
in a bid to bring inflation down from double-digits and maintain price
stability.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey governed by Naci Agbal decided to lift the key one-week repo rate
sharply to 17.00 percent from 15.00 percent.

The bank had raised the rate by 475 basis points at the first MPC
meeting of Agbal as governor in November.

Early November, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan replaced TCMB Governor
Murat Uysal with former finance minister Agbal after the Turkish lira
fell to a record low this year.

"In the forthcoming period, tightness of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance will be
decisively sustained until strong indicators point to a permanent fall
in inflation in line with the targets and to price stability, the bank
said in a statement.

The committee said domestic demand conditions, the exchange rate
effects, rising global food and other commodity prices and the weakness
in inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and
inflation outlook adversely.

In November, inflation rose to a 15-month high of 14.0 percent from 11.9
percent in October.

After taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, the MPC decided
to implement a strong monetary tightening, in order to eliminate risks
to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations and restore the
disinflation process as soon as possible.

Today's meeting will provide further reassurance to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that the
shift to orthodoxy is here to stay, Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

The CBRT has probably now done enough and the one-week repo rate is
expected to be kept at 17.00 percent for at least the next six months or
so, the economist added.
