UK manufacturers reported strong growth in demand in December, broadly
unchanged from last month's record high pace, the Industrial Trends
Survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed on Monday.

The order book balance came in at +24 percent in December, slightly down
from +26 percent in November. This was much better than the long-run
average of -13 percent.

At the same time, the balance for output growth improved sharply to +29
percent from +17 percent in the previous month.

However, a net balance of 23 percent of manufacturers expects output
growth to ease somewhat over the next three months.

Further, the survey showed that manufacturers anticipate strong output
price growth in the next three months. A net balance of 62 percent
forecast prices to rise compared to +67 percent in the previous month.

Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said firms are battling
pressures on a number of fronts. Stock adequacy of finished goods
worsened to an all-time low for the second month in a row, and continued
expectations for sharp price growth are a further challenge for the
sector.

"The spread of the Omicron variant will have been a blow to
[business][1] confidence," Leach added.
