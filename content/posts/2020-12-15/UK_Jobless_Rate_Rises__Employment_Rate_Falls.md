previous quarter.

At the same time, the employment rate decreased 0.5 percentage points
from the preceding period to 75.2 percent in three months to October.

Data showed that redundancies increased in August to October by a record
217,000 on the quarter, to a record high of 370,000.

In three months to October, total pay including bonuses increased to 2.7
percent from last year, and growth in regular pay, excluding bonuses
