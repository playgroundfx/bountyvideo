Italy's consumer prices decreased for the seventh consecutive month in
November, final data from the statistical office Istat showed on
Tuesday.

Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent year-on-year versus a 0.3 percent drop
in October. Prices have been falling since March. The rate matched the
flash estimate released on November 30.

Likewise, the harmonized index of consumer prices was down 0.3 percent
annually, as estimated, following a 0.6 percent decrease.

The annual fall in consumer prices was driven by an 8.6 percent decrease
in energy prices.

Core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, was +0.4 percent
versus +0.2 percent in the previous month.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.1 percent, in contrast to a
0.2 percent rise in the previous month. The HICP remained flat after
rising 0.6 percent. Both monthly rates came in line with flash estimate.
