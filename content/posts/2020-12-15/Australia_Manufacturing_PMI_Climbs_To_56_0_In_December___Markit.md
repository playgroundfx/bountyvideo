The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in December,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Wednesday with a five-month high manufacturing PMI score of 56.0.

That's up from 55.8 and it moves further above the boom-or-but line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new order growth hit a 25-month high and employment
expanded at the fastest rate in just under three years. On the price
front, there were stronger increases in both purchasing costs and
factory gate charges.

The report also showed that the services PMI rose from 55.1 to 57.4 and
the composite climbed from 54.9 to 57.0 - both also five-month highs.
