Despite government support measures, the UK unemployment increased in
the three months to October and redundancies reached a record high as
the [coronavirus][1] pandemic weighed on the labor market.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in three months to October,
the Office for National Statistics reported Tuesday. Economists had
forecast the rate to climb to 5.1 percent from 4.8 percent registered in
three months to September.

The number of people looking for jobs increased by 241,000 from the
previous quarter.

The unemployment is set to rise to 6 percent by year-end, despite
unprecedented wage support which probably meant over four million people
were furloughed during the November lockdowns, ING Economist James
Smith, said.

Data showed that redundancies increased by a record 217,000 on the
quarter, to a record high of 370,000.  
  
"The re-introduction of tighter restrictions and the expected cliff edge
caused by the original furlough scheme end date in October helped
driverecord redundancies," British Chambers of Commerce Head of
Economics Suren Thiru said.

With businesses facing the prospect of further restrictions and a messy
end to the Brexit transition period, major job losses remain probable in
the near term, Thiru added.

The employment rate decreased 0.5 percentage points from the preceding
period to 75.2 percent in three months to October.

In three months to October, total pay including bonuses increased to 2.7
percent from last year, and growth in regular pay, excluding bonuses
gained to 2.8 percent.

In November, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits
increased 64,300 from the previous month.
