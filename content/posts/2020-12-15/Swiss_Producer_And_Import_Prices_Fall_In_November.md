Switzerland's producer and import prices decreased in November, data
from the Federal Statistical Office showed on Tuesday.

Producer and import prices fell 2.7 percent year-on-year in November.

The producer price index decreased 1.3 percent annually in November and
import prices decreased 5.3 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer and import prices fell 0.1 percent in
November.

The latest decline was mainly due to a fall in prices of petroleum
products and pharmaceutical preparations, the agency said.

Domestic sale prices fell 0.9 percent yearly in November and declined
0.2 percent from a month ago.
