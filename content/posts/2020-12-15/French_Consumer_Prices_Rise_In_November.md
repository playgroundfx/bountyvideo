French consumer price inflation turned positive in November as initially
estimated, driven by food and services prices, final data from the
statistical office Insee showed Tuesday.

Consumer prices gained 0.2 percent year-on-year in November, after
remaining stable over the previous two months. The rate came in line
with the preliminary estimate released on November 27.

The annual increase resulted from the acceleration of the service prices
to 0.7 percent from 0.4 percent and those of the food to 2.0 percent
from 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, energy prices fell 7.8 percent.

Month-on-month, consumer prices climbed 0.2 percent, as estimated,
following a nil growth in October.

Core inflation advanced to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in October, data
showed.

The harmonized index of consumer prices increased 0.2 percent annually
after gaining 0.1 percent in October. The rate matched flash estimate.
On month, the index rose 0.2 percent after being stable in the previous
month.
