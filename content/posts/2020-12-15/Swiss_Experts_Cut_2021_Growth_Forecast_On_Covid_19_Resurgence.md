The Swiss [economy][1] is set to shrink less than expected this year,
but the recovery next year would be slower than forecast earlier, due to
the adverse effect from the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and
lockdown measures, the State Secretariat For Economic Affairs, or SECO,
said Tuesday.

Gross domestic product is set to fall a seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted
3.3 percent this year, which is slightly less than the 3.8 percent
decline projected in October. Yet, this would be the strongest decrease
since 1975.

The growth forecast for next year was lowered to 3 percent from 3.8
percent. The Swiss economy is projected to grow 3.1 percent in 2022.  
  
"If the [health][2] situation eases, growth is likely to increase
significantly as time goes on, although uncertainty remains extremely
high," the SECO said.

Experts slashed the growth forecasts for next year for personal
consumption, exports and imports.  
  
The unemployment rate is projected to climb to 3.3 percent next year
from 3.2 percent this year. Thereafter, it is seen easing to 3 percent
in 2022.  
  
Consumer prices are forecast to fall 0.7 percent this year and edge up
0.1 percent next year. Inflation is projected at 0.3 percent in the year
after.
