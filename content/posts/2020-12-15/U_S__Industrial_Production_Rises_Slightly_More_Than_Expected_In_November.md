Partly reflecting a continued increase in manufacturing output, the
Federal Reserve released a report on Tuesday showing U.S. industrial
production rose by slightly more than expected in the month of November.

The report said industrial production climbed by 0.4 percent in November
following a downwardly revised 0.9 percent advance in October.

Economists had expected industrial production to rise by 0.3 percent
compared to the 1.1 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

The Fed said manufacturing output increased for the seventh straight
month, advancing by 0.8 percent in November amid a 5.3 percent spike in
motor vehicles and parts production.

"The solid 0.8% increase in manufacturing output last month underlines
that, regardless of the virus situation, production is continuing to
catch up with the recovery in consumption," Michael Pearce, Senior U.S.
Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "With firms starting to rebuild lean inventories over recent
months, we suspect production will continue to rise, even as consumption
drops back in the face of new virus restrictions over the coming
months."

The report also showed a substantial rebound in mining output, which
surged up by 2.3 percent in November after falling by 0.7 percent in
October.

On the other hand, utilities output plunged by 4.3 percent in November
after jumping by 1.8 percent in October, as warmer than usual
temperatures reduced the demand for heating.

The Fed noted that industrial production has rebounded to about 5
percent below its pre-pandemic levels after having plummeted by 16.5
percent between February and April.

Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased to 73.3 percent
in November from a revised 73.0 percent in October.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to inch up to 72.9 percent
from the 72.8 percent originally reported for the previous month.

The report said capacity utilization in the manufacturing and mining
sectors rose to 72.6 percent and 79.4 percent, respectively, while
capacity utilization in the utilities sector slid to 70.2 percent.
