While the Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing an
unexpected decrease in new residential construction in the U.S. in the
month of October, the report also showed a bigger than expected spike in
building permits.

The report showed housing starts slid by 0.7 percent to an annual rate
of 1.520 million in October after tumbling by 2.7 percent to a revised
rate of 1.530 million in September.

The continued decline came as a surprise to economists, who had expected
housing starts to jump by 1.6 percent to an annual rate of 1.580 million
from the 1.555 million originally reported for the previous month.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said building permits surged up by
4.0 percent to an annual rate of 1.650 million in October after
plummeting by 7.8 percent to a revised rate of 1.586 million in
September.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, had been
expected to shoot up by 3.2 percent to an annual rate of 1.640 million
from the 1.589 million originally reported for the previous month.
