South Africa's consumer price inflation remained stable in October,
figures from Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 5.0 percent year-on-year in October, same
as seen in September. This was in line with economists' expectation.

The main contributions to the annual inflation came from food and non-
alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, transport, and miscellaneous
goods and services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 6.1 percent
annually in October and housing and utilities cost rose by 4.0 percent.

Prices of miscellaneous goods and services, and transport grew by 4.3
percent and 10.9 percent, respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer price grew 0.2 percent in October.
This was in line with economists' forecast.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.2 percent in October. This was in line with
economists' forecast.

On a monthly basis, core CPI rose 0.2 percent in September. This was in
line with economists' expectation.
