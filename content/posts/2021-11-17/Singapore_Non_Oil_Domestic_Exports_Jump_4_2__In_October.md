Non-oil domestic exports in Singapore climbed a seasonally adjusted 4.2
percent on month in October, Singapore's statistics department said on
Wednesday.

That easily exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.4 percent
following the downwardly revised 1.0 percent gain in September.

On a yearly basis, NODX spiked 17.9 percent - again beating forecasts
for 15.0 percent following the downwardly revised 12.0 percent jump in
the previous month (originally 12.3 percent).
