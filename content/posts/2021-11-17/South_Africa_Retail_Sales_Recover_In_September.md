South Africa's retail sales rose for the first time in three months in
September driven by higher demand for clothing and footwear and
pharmaceuticals and medical goods, Statistics South Africa reported
Wednesday.

Retail sales grew unexpectedly by 2.1 percent on a yearly basis in
September, after falling 1.5 percent in August and 1.2 percent in July.
Sales were forecast to fall 0.2 percent.

Sales of pharmaceuticals and medical goods, cosmetics and toiletries
surged 10.4 percent and that of textiles, clothing, footwear and leather
goods gained 11.3 percent.

Month-on-month, retail sales growth improved to 5.1 percent in September
from 4.9 percent in the previous month.

In the third quarter, retail trade decreased 5.4 percent compared with
the second quarter.
