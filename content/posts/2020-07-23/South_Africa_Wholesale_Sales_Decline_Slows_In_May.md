South Africa's wholesale sales declined sharply in May, though at a
softer pace, data from Statistics South Africa showed on Thursday.

Wholesale sales decreased an unadjusted 20.7 percent year-on-year in
May, following a 42.6 percent rise in April. This was the third
consecutive fall in sales.

The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s since March 27 have had
an extensive impact on economic activity, the statistical office said.

On a monthly basis, wholesale sales grew a seasonally adjusted 29.7
percent in May, after a 35.4 percent decline in the preceding month.

For the three months ended in May, wholesale sales fell 18.3 percent,
following a 13.1 percent decrease in the previous three months ended in
April.
