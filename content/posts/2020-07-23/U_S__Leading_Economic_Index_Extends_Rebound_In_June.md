Reflecting improvements brought about by the incremental reopening of
the [economy][1], the Conference Board released a report on Thursday
showing another significant increase by its reading on leading U.S.
economic indicators in the month of June.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index jumped by 2.0
percent in June after soaring by an upwardly revised 3.2 percent in May
and plunging by 6.3 percent in April.

Economists had expected the index to surge up by 2.5 percent in June
compared to the 2.8 percent spike originally reported for the previous
month.

Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The
Conference Board, noted labor market conditions and stock prices made
particularly strong positive contributions.

"However, broader financial conditions and the consumers' outlook on
[business][2] conditions still point to a weak economic outlook,"
Ozyildirim said.

He added, "Together with a resurgence of new COVID-19 cases across much
of the nation, the LEI suggests that the U.S. economy will remain in
recession territory in the near term."

The report said the coincident economic index spiked by 2.5 percent in
June following a 1.6 percent jump in May.

Meanwhile, the lagging economic index tumbled by 2.5 percent in June
after slumping by 1.2 percent in the previous month.
