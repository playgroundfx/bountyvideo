German consumer confidence is set to continue strengthening into August
from the weaker level caused by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, as the
reduction in the value-added tax boosted the propensity to buy, survey
data from market research group GfK showed Thursday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index rose to -0.3 points from
revised -9.4 in July. The expected reading was -5.0.

The consumer climate has risen significantly for the third consecutive
period.

Gfk said German consumers are gradually putting the coronavirus shock of
earlier this year behind them. A V-shaped trend is currently emerging
for the consumer climate.  
"There is no doubt that the reduction in value-added tax has contributed
to the extremely positive progress," Rolf Bürkl, GfK consumer expert,
said.

"It is clear that consumers are looking to make major purchases earlier
than planned, which will help boost spending this year. Whether this
will have a lasting impact is, however, debatable," Bürkl added.

While economic expectations gained slightly, income expectations and the
propensity to buy increased significantly for the third consecutive
time.

The economic expectations index rose only 2.1 points to 10.6 in July.
Nonetheless, the last time a higher value was recorded was in December
2018 at 10.8 points.

Consumers expect the largest euro area [economy][2] to recover within a
reasonable period of time. However, another wave of infections will
quickly shatter any hope of economic recovery.

At the same time, the income expectations indictor climbed to 18.6 in
July from 6.6 in June. The promise of a child bonus payment and a
noticeable decrease in price expectations are propping up the income
indicator, the market research group said.

Driven by VAT cut, the propensity to buy climbed sharply by 23.1 points
to 42.5 in July.

The survey was conducted by GfK on behalf of the European Commission.
The survey based on 2,000 consumer responses was carried out between
July 1 and 13.
