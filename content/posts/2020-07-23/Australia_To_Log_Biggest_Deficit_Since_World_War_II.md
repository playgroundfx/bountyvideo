Australia is set to record its biggest budget deficit since the World
War II as the government spurred spending to cushion the blow from the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

In the latest economic and fiscal update, released Thursday, the
Treasury said the underlying cash balance will be in a deficit of
A$184.5 billion in the financial year ending June 2021 due to the
unprecedented level of economic support coupled with declines in tax
receipts.

The deficit for 2019-20 is projected to be A$85.8 billion, Treasurer
Josh Frydenberg said.

According to the government estimate, tax receipts will decline by
A$31.7 billion in 2019-20 and A$63.9 billion in 2020-21.

At the same time, payments variations, including in demand driven
programs, increased by A$15.7 billion, predominantly as a result of the
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the [economy][2].

The government said the fiscal measures are estimated to have lowered
the peak of the unemployment rate by around 5 percentage points.

Despite the measures taken to support the economy, real GDP is forecast
to fall 2.5 percent in 2021 after falling by an estimated 3.75 percent
in 2020.

The unemployment rate is forecast to peak at around 9.25 percent in the
December quarter although labor market conditions are expected to
strengthen beyond 2020.

Although debt level increased notably, Australia continues to have a low
level of debt-to-GDP compared to other countries.

Net debt is expected to be A$488.2 billion or 24.6 percent of GDP at the
end of June 2020 and increase to A$677.1 billion, or 35.7 percent of GDP
at June 2021.

Today's fiscal update was a damp squib as the Treasurer didn't present
fiscal forecasts beyond June 2021 and didn't unveil fresh fiscal
support, Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

As [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers will probably unveil additional measures in the budget
due on October 6, the deficit in 2020/21 may be even larger than the
forecast of 9 percent of GDP, the economist noted. The shortfall should
shrink over coming years and the surge in public debt is not expected to
cause major problem.
