British manufacturers expect output to begin recovery in months ahead
for the first time since the Covid-19 crisis hit the [economy][1], the
quarterly Industrial Trends Survey from the Confederation of British
Industry showed Thursday.

A balance of manufacturers forecasting output to recover in the next
quarter came in at +15 percent, the first increase since February 2020.

According to the survey, the output volumes declined in the quarter to
July, with the balance falling to -59 percent from -57 percent in June.

At the same time, the order book balance fell at the fastest rate since
October 1980. The indicator came in at -60 percent versus -25 percent in
April.

A balance of 9 percent expects order book to pick up in the next three
months. Domestic orders are forecast to rise, while export orders are
expected to fall at a slower pace.

In July, the order book balance rose to -46 percent from -58 percent in
June. The expected balance was -38 percent.

Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said "Manufacturers continue to
face extreme hardship due to the COVID-19 crisis."

There are tentative signs of gradual recovery on the horizon, with firms
expecting output and orders to begin to pick up in the next three
months, the economist said. But demand still remains deeply depressed.
