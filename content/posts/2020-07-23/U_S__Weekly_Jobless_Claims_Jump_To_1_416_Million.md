After reporting decreases in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment
benefits for fifteen straight weeks, the Labor Department released a
report on Thursday showing a notable rebound in jobless claims in the
week ended July 18th.

The report said initial jobless claims jumped to 1.416 million, an
increase of 109,000 from the previous week's revised level of 1.307
million. Economists had expected jobless claims to come in unchanged at
the 1.300 million originally reported for the previous month.

Jobless claims increased for the first time since late March but remain
well below the record high of 6.867 million set in the week ended March
28th.
