Singapore's consumer prices declined at a softer rate in June, data from
the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and
Industry revealed on Thursday.

The consumer price index fell 0.5 percent year-on-year in June,
following a 0.8 percent decrease in May. Economists had expected a 0.6
percent decline.

This fall in the CPI was largely due to a smaller decline in private
transport costs.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.2 percent annually in June, same as in the preceding
month.

The latest decline can be attributed to higher food inflation that
offset a steeper drop in the cost of services, as well as smaller
decline in the costs of retail & other goods and electricity & gas.

Food inflation climbed due to a larger increase  in the prices of non-
cooked food items.

The statistical office expects external sources of inflation to remain
benign in the coming quarters, amid weak global demand condition. Oil
prices would remain low for a long period and will weigh on the prices
of energy-related components.

Supply chain disruptions caused by Covid-19 could continue to increase
the prices on imported food prices.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average between -1 percent and 0 percent in 2020, the statistical office
and MAS said.
