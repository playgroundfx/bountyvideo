Australia's [business][1] confidence declined in the second quarter due
to the weakness in construction and mining, quarterly survey data from
the National Australia Bank showed Thursday.

The business confidence index fell to -15 in the second quarter from -12
in the first quarter.

The survey showed a significant deterioration in both current conditions
as well as expected outcomes for activity, capex and employment going
forward.

The current conditions indicator declined sharply to -26 from -3 a
quarter ago. The reading reached the lowest level since the early 1990s.

The services sectors, including finance, business and property and
recreational and personal services led the decline in business
conditions and were the weakest across all industries.

Leading indicators posted a broad and significant deterioration. The
index measuring business conditions for the next three months came in at
-22 in the second quarter versus -4 in the first quarter. The outlook
for the next twelve months fell to -18 from 7 a quarter ago.

Labor indicators pointed to a large deterioration in the labor market.
Falling to -28 from -1, the employment index recorded its largest ever
fall and was at a very low level.

Further, survey measures of inflation pressures were weak. Final product
prices saw a deflation in the quarter while purchase cost growth also
slowed.
