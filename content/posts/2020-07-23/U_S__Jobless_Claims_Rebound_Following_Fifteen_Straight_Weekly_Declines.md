After reporting decreases in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment
benefits for fifteen straight weeks, the Labor Department released a
report on Thursday showing a notable rebound in jobless claims in the
week ended July 18th.

The report said initial jobless claims jumped to 1.416 million, an
increase of 109,000 from the previous week's revised level of 1.307
million.

Economists had expected jobless claims to come in unchanged compared to
the 1.300 million originally reported for the previous month.

Jobless claims increased for the first time since late March but remain
well below the record high of 6.867 million set in the week ended March
28th.

"The labor market remains in a precarious place as Covid-19 cases surge
in some parts of the country and stricter measures are adopted in
response," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

She added, "Claims data from the last few weeks point to layoffs and
less rehiring in possible signs of job losses in July payroll
employment.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average fell to 1,360,250, a decrease of 16,500 from the previous week's
revised average of 1,376,750.

The report said continuing claims, a reading on the number of people
receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 1.107 million
to 16.197 million in the week ended July 11th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also dropped to
17,505,250, a decrease of 758,500 from the previous week's revised
average of 18,263,750.

"The continuing claims figures suggest some rehiring is occurring, but
the initial claims data suggest we might see some pause in that
activity," said Vanden Houten.
