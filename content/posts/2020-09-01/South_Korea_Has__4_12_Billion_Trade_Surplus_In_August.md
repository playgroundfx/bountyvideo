South Korea posted a merchandise trade surplus of $4.12 billion in
August, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.

That was roughly in line with expectations following the downwardly
revised $4.13 billion surplus in July (originally $4.27 billion).

Exports were down 9.9 percent on year, which beat forecasts for a
decline of 11.5 percent following the downwardly revised 7.1 percent
contraction in the previous month (originally -7.0 percent).

Imports tumbled an annual 16.3 percent versus expectations for a 15.2
percent drop following the upwardly revised 11.6 percent decline a month
earlier (originally -11.9 percent).
