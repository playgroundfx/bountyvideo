Australia posted a current account surplus of A$17.738 billion in the
second quarter of 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Tuesday.

That beat forecasts for a surplus of A$13.0 billion and was up from the
upwardly revised A$9.023 billion in the three months prior (originally
A$8.4 billion).

The balance on goods and services surplus rose A$4.719 billion to
A$23.861 billion. The primary income deficit fell A$4.320 billion to
A$5.583 billion.

The surplus on goods and services rose A$4.982 billion to A$15.630
billion in the June quarter. This is expected to contribute 1.0
percentage points to growth in the Q2 volume measure of GDP.
