Russia's manufacturing sector expanded for the first time in over an
year in August, as output and new orders grew, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 51.1 in
August from 48.4 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in
the sector.

The manufacturing sector expanded for the first time since April last
year.

New orders rose marginally in August and the expansion in the new
[business][1] was the fastest since April 2019.

New export orders declined marginally, albeit at the slowest pace since
May 2019.

The number of workforce decreased in August, though at a slower pace
since March. Backlogs of work contracted at a softer pace.

Business confidence declined in August, but the degree of optimism
remained solid.

Input cost increased in August and selling price rose at a quicker rate.

Purchasing activity rose for the first time since August last year. Fall
in pre-production inventories were linked to greater production
requirements as firms used stocks to fulfill orders.

"Our current forecast points to a 6.5 percent decline in industrial
production on the year, with output expected to rise 2.9 percent in
2021," Sian Jones, Economist at IHS Markit, said.

"This suggests that any recovery in the manufacturing sector could be
drawn out as demand struggles to gain momentum," Jones added.
