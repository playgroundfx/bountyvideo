UK mortgage approvals rose to a five-month high in July but remained
weak in comparison to pre-Covid period, data from the Bank of England
showed Tuesday.

The number of mortgage approvals rose to 66,281 in July from 39,902 in
June. This was the highest since last February. This was also above
economists' forecast of 54,840.  
Nonetheless, approvals were 10 percent below the February level of
73,700.

Households borrowed an additional GBP 2.7 billion secured on their
homes, up from GBP 2.4 billion in June. The expected increase was GBP
2.8 billion.

Following four months of net repayments, consumer credit increased by
GBP 1.2 billion in July. On a yearly basis, consumer credit fell 3.6
percent versus a 3.7 percent drop in June.

July's money and credit data confirmed the resurgence in the housing
market while recovering consumer credit suggests that households'
appetite for big ticket purchases is returning, Andrew Wishart at
Capital Economics, said.

Data showed that corporates repaid GBP 3.0 billion of loans in July. Net
borrowing by small and medium sized businesses was more than offset by
net repayments by large businesses.

The monetary aggregate M4 grew 0.9 percent on month, taking the annual
growth to 13.5 percent in July.
