China's manufacturing activity expanded for the fourth straight month in
August suggesting that the sector continued to recover from the impact
of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, survey data from IHS Markit showed
Tuesday.

The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.1 in
August from 52.8 in July. The reading signaled a solid overall
improvement in the [health][2] of the sector, and one that was the most
marked since January 2011.

According to official survey, the manufacturing PMI fell marginally to
51.0 in August from 51.1, while the non-manufacturing PMI advanced to
55.2 from 54.2 a month ago.

IHS Markit survey revealed that manufacturing new orders expanded at the
sharpest rate since the start of 2011 amid reports of firmer client
demand as the domestic and global [economy][3] continued to recover from
the pandemic. Notably, manufacturers registered the first increase in
new export sales since December 2019.

Driven by higher new [business][4], production expanded further. The
rate of growth was the most marked since January 2011. At the same time,
staff numbers fell at a fractional pace that was the slowest in the year
to date.

Chinese manufacturers faced a further increase in average input costs in
August. The rate of inflation remained solid overall amid reports of
greater raw material costs. Consequently, companies partially passed on
their higher operating expenses to clients in the form of higher selling
prices.

Although firms generally expect output to rise over the next year, the
degree of optimism edged down to a three-month low in August.

The survey data suggest that manufacturing growth has continued to pick
up in recent weeks, despite having already returned to its pre-virus
level at the end of the second quarter, Julian Evans-Pritchard and
Sheana Yue, economists at Capital Economics, said.

In the near-term, continued [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus is set to keep industrial
growth strong, the economists added.

Macroeconomic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) supports are essential, especially when there are
still many uncertainties in domestic and overseas economies, Wang Zhe,
senior economist at Caixin Insight Group said. Relevant policies should
not be significantly tightened.
