India's manufacturing activity expanded in August for the first time in
five months, amid a rise in output and new orders, survey results from
IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The headline IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or
PMI, rose to 52.0 in August from 46.0 in July. Any reading above 50
indicates expansion in the sector.

Output expanded for the first time since March, driven by greater client
demand in August.

New orders increased as the foreign exports declined in August. New
[business][1] expanded at a faster pace since February.

Job shedding continued in August and relocation of employees due to
Covid-19 was linked to reduction in staffing numbers. The rate of
backlogs of work was the fastest since December 2012.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in August due to supply delay and
capacity pressure.

Cost burden increased for the first time since March, with the rate of
input price inflation highest since November 2018, while factory gate
charges lowered.

Manufacturers remained optimistic for the next 12 months and market
uncertainty and the onset of global recession weighed slightly on the
degree of confidence.
