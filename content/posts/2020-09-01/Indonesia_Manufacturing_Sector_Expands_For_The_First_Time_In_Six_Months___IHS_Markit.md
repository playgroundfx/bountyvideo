The manufacturing sector in Indonesia swung to expansion in August, the
latest survey from IHS Market showed on Tuesday with a manufacturing PMI
score of 50.8.

That's up from 46.9 in July and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders both expanded at the quickest rates
in six years, but job losses persisted amid signs on ongoing spare
capacity.

Purchasing activity was down at a softer but still marked rate.
