The manufacturing sector in Malaysia dropped back into contraction in
August, the latest survey from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 49.3.

That's down from 50.0 in July and it moves back beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production was unchanged, building on recent growth - but
new orders continued to soften. Employment has bene scaled back to the
greatest degree in survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Evidence from panel members suggested that customer demand remained
relatively weak, notably in foreign [markets][1].
