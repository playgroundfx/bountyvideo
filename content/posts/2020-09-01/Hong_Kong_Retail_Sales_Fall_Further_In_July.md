Hong Kong's retail sales declined further in July, albeit at a softer
rate, figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Tuesday.

The retail sales volume declined 23.9 percent year-on-year in July,
following a 25.3 percent decrease in June.

The value of retail sales decreased 23.1 percent annually in July,
following a 24.7 percent fall in the preceding month.

Sales value of jewelry, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts declined
53.7 percent annually in July. Sales of clothing, footwear and allied
products fell by 44.1 percent and those of other consumer goods
decreased 32.2 percent.

"The year-on-year decline in retail sales remained notable in July
despite a lower base of comparison, as the surge of local COVID-19 cases
and the resultant tightening of social distancing measures in that month
further disrupted consumption activities," a government spokesman said.

The spokesman says that, "while the recent stabilization in the local
epidemic situation may help improve consumption sentiment, the
[business][1] environment of the retail trade will continue to be very
difficult in the near term as inbound tourism remains at a standstill."
