Australia's central bank retained its interest rate at a record low and
quantitative easing unchanged but increased the size of the Term Funding
Facility to keep interest rates lower for borrowers.

The board of Reserve Bank of Australia, governed by Philip Lowe, decided
on Tuesday, to maintain cash rate and the targeted yield on three-year
government bonds of 25 basis points.

Under the expanded Term Funding Facility, authorized deposit-taking
institutions will have access to additional funding, equivalent to 2
percent of their outstanding credit, at a fixed rate of 25 basis points
for three years.

Today's decision to expand term funding facility would raise the total
amount available under the facility to around A$200 billion.

The RBA had reduced the key interest rate to the current record low of
0.25 percent at the March meeting. Also in March, the bank had
introduced asset purchase programme to combat the downturn caused by the
pandemic.

The Board said it will maintain highly accommodative settings as long as
is required and continues to consider how further monetary measures
could support the recovery.

The RBA's decision to expand its Term Funding Facility which should
contribute to continued strong growth in the money supply, Marcel
Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Given that 10-year yields have crept higher recently, the Bank is likely
to try to lower longer-term yields by expanding its bond purchases next
year, the economist added.

The announcement came ahead of the release of quarterly national
accounts on September 2. Economists forecast the [economy][1] to
contract 6 percent sequentially in the second quarter.

Policymakers said that economic downturn caused by the [coronavirus][2]
pandemic is not as severe as earlier expected and a recovery is now
under way in most of Australia.  
However, the recovery is likely to be both uneven and bumpy, with the
virus outbreak in Victoria having a major effect on the Victorian
economy.

The virus outbreak in Victoria and subdued growth in aggregate demand
more broadly suggests that it is likely to be some months before a
meaningful recovery in the labor market is under way, the bank said.

In the Bank's central scenario, the unemployment rate would rise to
around 10 percent later in 2020 and then declines gradually to be to
still around 7 percent in two years' time.
