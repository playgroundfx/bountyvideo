The Czech Republic's [economy][1] shrank more than expected in the
second quarter, largely due to a slump in external demand as global
trade was hurt severely by the coronavirus pandemic, latest data from
the Czech Statistical Office showed on Tuesday.

Price and seasonally adjusted gross domestic product decreased a record
8.7 percent, which was more severe a fall than the 8.4 percent decline
estimated initially.

The first quarter slump was revised to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent.

Two consecutive quarters of GDP decline qualify as a technical
recession, which is a first in the country since 2009.

Total consumption decreased 4.8 percent quarter-on-quarter with a 6.3
percent fall in household spending. State spending decreased 1.5
percent.

Gross fixed capital formation grew 0.9 percent, largely led by
investments in the construction sector, while spending on machinery and
transport equipment decreased sharply.

On a year-on-year basis, GDP dropped 11 percent in the second quarter
after a 1.9 percent decline in the first three months of 2020.
