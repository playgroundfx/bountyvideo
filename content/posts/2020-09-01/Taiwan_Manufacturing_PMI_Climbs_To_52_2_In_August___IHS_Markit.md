The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to expand in August, and at
a faster pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on Tuesday
with a manufacturing PMI score of 52.2.

That's up from 50.6 in July, and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders expanded at the steepest rates since
June 2018, although employment fell again as firms tried to contain
costs.

There was a sharper rise in input costs but output charges increased
only slightly.
