Manufacturing activity in the U.S. expanded at a faster rate in the
month of August, the Institute for Supply Management revealed in a
report on Tuesday.

The ISM said its purchasing managers index rose to 56.0 in August from
54.2 in July, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in manufacturing
activity. Economists had expected the index to inch up to 54.5.

"After the [coronavirus][1] (COVID-19) brought manufacturing activity to historic lows, the sector continued its recovery in August, the first full month of operations after supply chains restarted and adjustments were made for employees to return to work," said Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.

He added, "Demand and consumption continued to drive expansion growth,
with inputs representing near- and moderate-term supply chain
difficulties."

The bigger than expected increase by the headline index came as the new
orders index jumped to 67.6 in August from 61.5 in July.

The production index also increased to 63.3 in August from 62.1 in July,
while the employment index climbed to 46.4 from 44.3 but still indicates
a contraction.

On the inflation front, the prices index surged up to 59.5 in August
from 53.2 in July, indicating an acceleration in the pace of price
growth.

Fiore noted many panelists' companies are holding off on capital
investments for the rest of 2020 due to the current economic
environment.

The ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on activity in the
service sector on Thursday. The non-manufacturing index is expected to
edge down to 57.0 in August from 58.1 in July.
