The Reserve Bank of Australia will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
on Wednesday and then announce its decision on interest rates,
highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The RBA is
widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at the
record low of 0.25 percent.

Australia also will see July results for the consumer confidence index
from Westpac; in June, the index tumbled 5.2 percent to a score of
107.2.

Singapore will provide an advance estimate for Q2 gross domestic
product, with forecasts suggesting an increase of 2.0 percent on quarter
and 14.2 percent on year. That follows the 3.1 percent quarterly
increase and the 0.2 percent yearly gain in the three months prior.

South Korea will release June figures for unemployment in May, the
jobless rate was 3.8 percent.

Japan will see final May figures for industrial production; the previous
reading suggested an increase of 2.9 percent on month and 15.8 percent
on year, while capacity utilization was up 1.1 percent on month.
