Consumer prices in the U.S. saw the biggest monthly increase in thirteen
years in the month of June, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Tuesday.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index jumped by 0.9 percent
in June after climbing by 0.6 percent in May. Economists had expected
consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in consumer prices reflected the
biggest advance since prices surged up by 1.0 percent in June of 2008.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices still jumped by
0.9 percent in June following a 0.7 percent increase in May. Core prices
were expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

The annual rate of consumer price growth accelerated to 5.4 percent in
June from 5 percent in May, reaching the highest level since a matching
spike in August of 2008.

Core consumer prices were up by 4.5 percent year-over-year in June,
reflecting an acceleration from the 3.8 percent jump in May. Core prices
saw the biggest annual increase since November of 1991.
