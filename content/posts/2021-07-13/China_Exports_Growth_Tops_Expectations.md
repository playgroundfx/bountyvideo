China's exports and imports grew more-than-expected in June, data from
the General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday.

Exports advanced 32.2 percent year-on-year in June, bigger than the
economists' forecast of 23.1 percent. Shipments were up 27.9 percent in
May.

Likewise, imports climbed 36.7 percent on a yearly basis, faster than
the expected rate of 30 percent.

As a result, the trade surplus increased to $51.5 billion in June from
$45.5 billion in the previous month. The expected level was $44.2
billion.
