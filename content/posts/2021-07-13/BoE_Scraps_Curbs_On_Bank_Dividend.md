The Bank of England removed the restrictions put in place regarding the
distribution of bank profits last year as the banking system proved
resilient to a wide range of risks.

The extraordinary guardrails on shareholder distributions are no longer
necessary, the Financial Policy Committee said in its meeting held on
June 30.

As the banking sector is well capitalized, the FPC scrapped the
temporary curb imposed on paying dividend and share buybacks.

The FPC judged that the interim results of the 2021 solvency stress
test, together with the central outlook, are consistent with the
Prudential Regulation Committee's decision.

Further, the FPC expects banks to use all elements of their capital
buffers as necessary to support the [economy][1] through the recovery.

The committee expects to maintain the countercyclical capital buffer
rate at zero percent until at least December, indicating that any
subsequent increase would not be expected to take effect until the end
of 2022 at the earliest.

The committee said it remains vigilant to debt vulnerabilities in the
financial system that could amplify risks to the financial stability.
