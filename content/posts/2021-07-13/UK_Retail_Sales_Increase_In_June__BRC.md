UK retail sales logged a double-digit growth in June driven by the
easing of lockdown restrictions, the British Retail Consortium reported
Tuesday.

In June, retail sales advanced 13.1 percent on a yearly basis. Like-for-
like sales were up 17 percent from the same period last year.

"Retail sales growth continued in June, albeit at a slower rate as the
re-opening of hospitality and leisure sectors led to a dilution in
consumer spending," Paul Martin, Retail Partner at KPMG, said.  
  
The fight for share of wallet is underway, as consumers unleash pent up
demand for social activities as restrictions in the UK continue to
unwind, Martin added.

In June, while growth in food sales begun to slow, non-food sales were
bolstered by growing consumer confidence and the continued unleashing of
consumer demand, Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

With many people taking staycations, or cheaper UK-based holidays, many
have found they have a little extra to spend at the shops, with strong
growth in-store in June, said Dickinson.
