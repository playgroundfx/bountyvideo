trillion yen).

Exports were up 23.2 percent on year to 7.445 trillion yen, while
imports jumped an annual 44.9 percent to 7.877 trillion yen for a trade
deficit of 431.3 billion yen.

The capital account saw a deficit of 20.7 billion yen in November, while
the financial account had a surplus of 218.5 billion yen.
