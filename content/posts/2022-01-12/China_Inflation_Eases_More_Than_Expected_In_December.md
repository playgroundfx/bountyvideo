China inflation eased more than expected at the end of 2021 largely due
to the fall in food prices and factory gate inflation moderated further,
official data revealed on Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation slowed to 1.5 percent in December from 2.3
percent in November, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The rate
was expected to slow to 1.8 percent.

Food prices fell 1.2 percent from a year earlier and non-food prices
advanced 2.1 percent.

Core inflation that excludes volatile food and energy prices, held
steady at 1.2 percent in December.

On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices decreased 0.3 percent,
confounding expectations for an increase of 0.2 percent.  
  
Headline inflation will remain below 2 percent throughout most of this
year, Sheana Yue and Julian Evans-Pritchard, economists at Capital
Economics, said.  
  
In a separate communiqu√©, the NBS reported that factory gate inflation
dropped to 10.3 percent in December from 12.9 percent a month ago.
Inflation was seen at 11.1 percent.

Factory gate inflation will probably trend down further over the coming
months, economists at Capital Economics, said.

Admittedly, there is a risk that worsening virus outbreaks could result
in renewed disruptions to supply chains, they noted. But base effects
will start to weigh heavily on the headline PPI rate this quarter.
