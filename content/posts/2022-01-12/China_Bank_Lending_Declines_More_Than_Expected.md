China's bank lending declined more than expected in December, data from
the People's Bank of China showed on Wednesday.

In December, banks extended CNY 1.13 trillion in new loans compared to
CNY 1.27 trillion lending in November. Economists had forecast lending
to fall marginally to CNY 1.25 trillion.

Aggregate financing decreased to CNY 2.37 trillion in December and also
remained below the economists' forecast of CNY 2.45 trillion.

The figures are surprising given the PBoC, China's central bank, cut the
reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points last month, and
interest rates by 5 basis points, Iris Pang, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

For the corporate sector, demand for loans is mostly affected by real
estate and companies along the supply chain, the economist noted.

Sheana Yue and Julian Evans-Pritchard, economists at Capital Economics,
said credit growth will probably continue to edge up in the coming
months given intensifying efforts to push down borrowing costs and boost
lending.  
  
That said, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers still appear keen to balance their desire to
soften the economic downturn with their concerns over high debt levels,
they added.
