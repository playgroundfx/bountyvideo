India's consumer price inflation accelerated further in December, driven
by strong price growth in the fuel, clothing and footwear, and food
categories, preliminary data from the statistical office showed
Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 5.59 percent year-on-year following a 4.91
percent increase in the previous month. Economists had forecast 5.80
percent inflation.

The food price index climbed 4.05 percent annually after a 1.87 percent
rise in November.

Compared to the previous month, the CPI fell 0.36 percent and the food
price index dropped 1.18 percent in December.

Prices in the fuel and light group rose 10.95 percent annually and those
in the clothing and footwear group increased 8.30 percent. Food and
beverages registered a 4.47 percent increase.
