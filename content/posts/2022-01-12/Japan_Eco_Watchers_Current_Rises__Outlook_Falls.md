A measure of the public assessment of the Japanese [economy][1]
increased in December, survey data from the Cabinet Office showed on
Wednesday.

The current conditions index of the Economy Watchers' Survey, which
measures the current situation of the economy, increased marginally to
56.4 in December from 56.3 in November.

Economists had expected a reading of 56.5.

The outlook index that signals future activity fell to 49.4 in December
from 53.4 in the previous month. In October, the reading was 57.5.

However, a reading below 50 suggests pessimism.
