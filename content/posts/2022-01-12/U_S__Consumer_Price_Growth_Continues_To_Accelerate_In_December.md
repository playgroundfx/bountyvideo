A highly anticipated report released by the Labor Department on
Wednesday showed the annual rate of U.S. consumer price growth once
again reached the highest level in almost 40 years in December.

The report showed the annual rate of consumer price growth accelerated
to 7.0 percent in December from 6.8 percent in November, showing the
biggest yearly jump since June of 1982.

Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, were up by
5.5 percent year-over-year in December compared to the 4.9 percent spike
in November. The annual growth reflected the biggest surge since
February of 1991.

The continued acceleration in the annual rate of consumer price growth
came as prices increased by slightly more than expected on a monthly
basis.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.5 percent
in December following a 0.8 percent advance in November. Economists had
expected consumer prices to rise by 0.4 percent.

Core consumer prices increased by 0.6 percent in December after climbing
by 0.5 percent in November. Core prices were expected to advance by 0.5
percent.

The monthly consumer price growth primarily reflected higher prices for
shelter and used cars and trucks along with an increase in food prices.

On the other hand, the report said energy prices fell by 0.4 percent in
December amid decreases in prices for gasoline and natural gas.

"The Fed now sees it as its top priority to ensure that inflation
moderates back towards the long-run 2% inflation target in order to
promote a long-lasting economic expansion that brings about maximum
employment over time," said Kathy Bostjancic, Chief U.S. Financial
Economist at Oxford Economics.

"We now see the Fed raising rates in March and on course for four rate
hikes in total in 2022," she added. "Based on the hawkish comments from
Fed officials, balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening) will
likely start mid-year."

On Thursday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on producer prices in the month of December. Producer prices are
expected to rise by 0.4 percent, while core producer prices are expected
to climb by 0.5 percent.
