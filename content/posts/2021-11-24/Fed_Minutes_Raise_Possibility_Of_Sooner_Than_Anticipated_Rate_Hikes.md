Reflecting concerns about the pace of inflation, the minutes of the
Federal Reserve's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting in early November revealed
some participants felt the central bank should be prepared to raise
interest rates sooner than currently anticipated.

The minutes released Wednesday afternoon said various participants
believe the Fed might need to both reduce asset purchases and raise
rates if inflation continues to run higher than levels consistent with
the central bank's objectives.

However, others argued that a patient attitude remained appropriate in
light of the considerable uncertainty about developments in supply
chains, production logistics, and the course of the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic.

The participants still agreed that the Fed should not hesitate to take
appropriate actions to address inflation pressures that posed risks to
its longer-run price stability and employment objectives.

The potential for sooner-than-anticipated rate hikes comes as a number
of participants expressed concerns the public's longer-term expectations
of inflation might increase to a level above that consistent with the
Fed's longer-run inflation objective.

The Fed has repeatedly indicated it aims to achieve inflation moderately
above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over
time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2
percent.

The minutes said a couple of participants pointed to increases in survey
and market-based indicators of expected inflation as possible signs that
inflation expectations were becoming less well anchored.

At the same time, several others said measures of near and medium-term
inflation expectations had not exhibited greater sensitivity than usual
and noted indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained well
anchored at levels consistent with the Fed's longer-run 2 percent goal.

The Fed agreed during the meeting to reduce the pace of its $120 billion
per month in asset purchases by $15 per month beginning in mid-November.

The minutes showed some participants felt reducing the pace of asset
purchases by more than $15 billion each month could be warranted so that
the Fed would be in a better position to raise interest rates.

"We still think that market expectations for a series of rate hikes
beginning by mid-2022 are overdone, particularly as inflation will be
declining by that time," said Paul Ashworth, Chief US Economist at
Capital Economics.

He continued, "But the FOMC has clearly woken up to the realization
that, even if it falls back somewhat, inflation is likely to remain
above target for some considerable time."
