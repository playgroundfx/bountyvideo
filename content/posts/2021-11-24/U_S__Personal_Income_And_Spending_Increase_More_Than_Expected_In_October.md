Personal income in the U.S. rebounded by more than expected in the month
of October, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Wednesday, while the report also showed a bigger than expected jump in
personal spending.

The Commerce Department said personal income climbed by 0.5 percent in
October after slumping by 1.0 percent in September. Economists had
expected personal income to edge up by 0.2 percent.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, also rose by 0.3 percent in October after tumbling by 1.3 percent
in the previous month.

Increases in private wages and salaries and dividend and interest income
were partly offset by a decrease in unemployment insurance.

The report also showed personal spending surged up by 1.3 percent in
October following a 0.6 percent advance in September. Spending was
expected to increase by 0.9 percent.

Excluding price changes, personal spending climbed 0.7 percent in
October after rising by 0.3 percent in the previous month.

"The 0.7% gain in real consumption in October means that we now expect
fourth-quarter GDP growth to be 6.5% annualized, much stronger than the
4.0% we had previously penciled in," said Andrew Hunter, Senior US
Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "That said, we still expect weaker real incomes to weigh on
real consumption over the coming months, and the sharp rise in virus
cases in the Northeast and Midwest is an additional downside risk."

With spending jumping by much more than income, personal saving as a
percentage of disposable income dropped to 7.3 percent in October from a
revised 8.2 percent in September.

Meanwhile, a reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal
Reserve showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth accelerated
to 4.1 percent in October from 3.7 percent in September, reaching the
highest level since 1991.

"With another big rise likely in November, that means the 3.7% fourth-
quarter forecast that Fed officials made for core PCE inflation only a
couple of months ago already looks much too low," Hunter said. "We
expect core inflation to still be higher than the Fed anticipates by the
end of next year too.

He added, "The upshot is that the chances of the Fed accelerating the
pace of its QE taper, and therefore bringing forward the first interest
rate hike, continue to increase."
