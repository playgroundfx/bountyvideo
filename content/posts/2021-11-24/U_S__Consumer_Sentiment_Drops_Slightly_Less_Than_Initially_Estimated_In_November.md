The University of Michigan released a report on Wednesday showing
consumer sentiment in the U.S. decreased by slightly less than initially
estimated in the month of November.

The report said the consumer sentiment index for November was upwardly
revised to 67.4 from the preliminary reading of 66.8. Economists had
expected the index to be upwardly revised to 66.9.

Despite the upward revision, the consumer sentiment index was down from
71.7 in October and was still at its lowest level since hitting 63.7 in
November of 2011.

"Consumers expressed less optimism in the November 2021 survey than any
other time in the past decade about prospects for their own finances as
well as for the overall [economy][1]," said Surveys of Consumers chief
economist Richard Curtin.

He added, "The decline was due to a combination of rapidly escalating
inflation combined with the absence of federal policies that would
effectively redress the inflationary damage to household budgets."

One-year inflation expectations inched up to 4.9 percent in November
from 4.8 percent in October, while five-year inflation expectations
crept up to 3.0 percent from 2.9 percent.

The report also showed the current economic conditions index fell to
73.6 in November from 77.7 in October. The index of consumer
expectations also dropped to 63.5 from 67.9.
