UK manufacturers reported the strongest growth in orders since records
began in 1977 and they expect production to accelerate over the next
three months, the Industrial Trends Survey data from the Confederation
of British Industry showed on Thursday.

The order book balance rose to 26 percent in November from 9 percent in
October. This was the highest score since April 1977.

The export order book balance came in at +3 percent versus -7 percent in
the previous month. Order books strengthened at the fastest pace since
March 2019.

A net 17 percent of manufacturers said production increased in three
months to November compared to +15 percent in October. A net 32 percent
expects output growth to accelerate in the next three months.

"It's good to see strong order books and output growth in the
manufacturing sector holding up as we head into winter," Anna Leach, CBI
deputy chief economist, said.

But intense supply side challenges continue to put pressure on firms'
capacity to meet demand, Leach added. Alongside record order books,
stock adequacy was the weakest on record in November and manufacturers
are increasingly having to pass on significant cost increases to
customers.
