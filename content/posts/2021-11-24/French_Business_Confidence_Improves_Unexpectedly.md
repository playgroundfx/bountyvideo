France's [business][1] confidence improved in November, defying
expectations for a weakening, preliminary data from the statistical
office INSEE showed Wednesday.  
  
The composite business confidence indicator rose to 109 from 107 logged
in each of the previous two months. Economists had expected the reading
to ease to 106.  
  
The reading remained above its long term average of 100.  
  
INSEE attributed the latest improvement mostly to the rise in the
balance on foreign order-books and, partly to the increase in the
balances on overall order-books and on expected production.  
  
In addition, the balance on the expected trend in selling prices,
already very high, has increased very strongly this month, the
statistical office said.  
  
The foreign order book balance climbed to -3 from -15, marking the
highest level since July 2018, and the total order book balance rose to
-4 from -7. The former increased driven by an improvement in the further
demand for transport equipment.  
  
The personal productions sub-index rose to 20 from 17, while the general
productions measure dropped to 20 from 21.  
  
The index reflecting the expected trend in selling prices surged to
record high of 47 from 27.
