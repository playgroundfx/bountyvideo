Russia's central bank lowered its key rate by 25 basis points to a new
record low on Friday and signaled more reductions as the [economy][1] is
expected to follow a gradual recovery from the downturn caused by the
coronavirus pandemic.

The Board of Directors, led by Governor Elvira Nabiullina, decided to
reduce the benchmark rate to 4.25 percent from 4.50 percent. The
decision came in line with economists' expectations.

The bank had reduced the rate by 100 basis points in June and by 50
basis points in April.

The bank said it will consider the necessity of further key rate
reduction at its upcoming meetings.

Disinflationary factors continue to exert considerable influence on
inflation, the bank observed.

According to the board, there is a risk that in 2021 inflation might
deviate downwards from the 4 percent target. A significant easing of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) since April was aimed at curbing this risk and
stabilizing inflation close to 4 percent.

Given the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, annual inflation is forecast
to reach 3.7-4.2 percent in 2020, 3.5-4.0 percent in 2021 and will stand
close to 4 percent later on.

Driven by monetary easing and regulatory measures, the economy is
forecast to expand 4.5-5.5 percent in 2020.

Thereafter, GDP is expected to follow a recovery path with growth
predicted to total 3.5-4.5 percent in 2021 and 2.5-3.5 percent in 2022.
