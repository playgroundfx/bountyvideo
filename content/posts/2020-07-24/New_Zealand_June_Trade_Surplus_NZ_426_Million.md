New Zealand had a merchandise trade surplus of NZ$426 million in June,
Statistics Korea said on Friday - down from the NZ$1.253 billion surplus
in May.

Exports were up 2.2 percent on year or NZ$107 million to NZ$5.07
billion, down from NZ$5.39 billion in the previous month.

Higher milk powder exports and a recovery in log exports helped boost
total exports in June 2020, up NZ$107 million to NZ$5.1 billion from
June 2019.

Leading the rise was New Zealand's biggest export commodity group, milk
powder, butter, and cheese, up NZ$90 million to NZ$1.2 billion from last
June.

Milk powder rose NZ$108 million to reach NZ$650 million, which was
partly offset by a fall in milk fats including butter, down NZ$38
million.

In contrast to the falls in previous months, quantities and values of
log exports in June 2020 were up in June 2019, up 8.8 percent and 7.0
percent, respectively.

Imports rose 0.2 percent on year of NZ$11 million to NZ$4.64 billion, up
from NZ$4.14 billion.

Of New Zealand's main trading partners, imports from the United States
of America had the biggest fall in June 2020, down NZ$111 million when
compared with June 2019. Mechanical machinery and equipment (such as
turbo-jet and turbo-propeller parts) led the fall, down NZ$58 million
(41 percent).

Goods imports from China were up NZ$97 million (10 percent) in June 2020
when compared with June 2019. The leading rises were electrical
machinery and equipment (such as mobile phones) up NZ$45 million,
articles of plastic (such as disposable aprons) up NZ$27 million, and
textiles (such as face masks) up NZ$23 million.

For the second quarter of 2020, exports fell 5.8 percent on quarter or
NZ$904 million to NZ$14.7 billion. Imports sank 16.0 percent on quarter
or NZ$2.5 billion to NZ$13.2 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of
NZ$1.4 billion - the first quarterly surplus since 2014 Q1.

On an annual basis, exports rose NZ$822 million or 1.4 percent to
NZ$60.2 billion. Imports sank NZ$3.0 billion or 4.6 percent to NZ$61.4
billion. The annual trade deficit was NZ$1.2 billion, the smallest
annual trade deficit since 2014 Q4.
