The euro area private sector grew at the fastest pace in just over two
years in July due to the relaxation of the [coronavirus][1] containment
measures, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed Friday.

The composite output index rose to a 25-month high of 54.8 from 48.5 in
June. This was also above economists' forecast of 51.1.

The improvement in part reflected a technical rebound from recent
lockdowns, as businesses and their customers increasingly returned to
work following the further relaxation of Covid-19 containment measures
across the region.

The survey showed that output expectations improved in July, and new
order inflows picked up and job losses eased.

The flash services Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to 55.1 from 48.3
in June. The expected reading was 51.0.

The flash manufacturing PMI came in at 51.1 versus 47.4 in June and
forecast of 50.0.  
  
"The data add to signs that the [economy][2] should see a strong rebound
after the unprecedented collapse in the second quarter," Chris
Williamson, chief [business][3] economist at IHS Markit said.

"However, while the survey's output measures hint at an initial v-shaped
recovery, other indicators such as backlogs of work and employment warn
of downside risks to the outlook," Williamson added.
