UK retail sales logged a double-digit growth in June as non-food and
fuel stores continued their recovery from the sharp falls experienced
since the start of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the Office for
National Statistics reported Friday.

Retail sales volume advanced 13.9 percent on month, faster than the 12.3
percent rise in May and bigger than economists' forecast of 8 percent.

Growth in sales, excluding auto fuel, improved to 13.5 percent in June
from 10.6 percent a month ago. Sales were forecast to grow 7.5 percent.

Non-food stores and fuel sales showed strong monthly growths in the
volume of sales at 45.5 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively.

On a yearly basis, retail sales volume dropped at a slower pace of 1.6
percent after easing 12.9 percent in May. Economists had expected a 6.4
percent drop for June.

Excluding auto fuel, retail sales grew 1.7 percent in June, in contrast
to a 9.6 percent drop in May. Economists had forecast a 3.7 percent
decrease.
