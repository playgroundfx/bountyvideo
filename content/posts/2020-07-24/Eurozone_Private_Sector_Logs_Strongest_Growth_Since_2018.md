The euro area private sector expanded at the fastest pace in just over
two years in July as economies continued to reopen after lockdowns were
implemented to curb the spread of [coronavirus][1], flash survey data
from IHS Markit showed Friday.

The composite output index rose to a 25-month high of 54.8 in July from
48.5 in June. This was also above economists' forecast of 51.1.

The improvement in part reflected a technical rebound from recent
lockdowns, as businesses and their customers increasingly returned to
work following the further relaxation of Covid-19 containment measures
across the region.

The survey showed that output expectations improved in July, and new
order inflows picked up and job losses eased. Average prices charged for
goods and services fell for a fifth month, the survey showed.

Both manufacturing and services returned to growth, with growth hitting
23- and 25-month highs respectively, in July.

The flash services Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to 55.1 from 48.3
in June. The expected reading was 51.0.

The flash manufacturing PMI came in at 51.1 versus 47.4 in June and
forecast of 50.0.  
  
"The data add to signs that the [economy][2] should see a strong rebound
after the unprecedented collapse in the second quarter," Chris
Williamson, chief [business][3] economist at IHS Markit said.

"However, while the survey's output measures hint at an initial v-shaped
recovery, other indicators such as backlogs of work and employment warn
of downside risks to the outlook," Williamson added.

By country, French companies led the upturn, reporting a second
successive month of output gains. France's composite output index
climbed to 57.6 from 51.7 in June. The reading was also above
economists' forecast of 53.5.

The acceleration in output growth was primarily driven by a sharp
increase in services activity. The services PMI came in at a 30-month
high of 57.8, up from 50.7 in June. The expected level was 52.3.

Meanwhile, the factory PMI fell unexpectedly to 52.0 from 52.3 in June.
The reading was forecast to rise to 53.2.

In Germany, output rose for the first time since February, increasing to
an extent not seen for almost two years. The composite output index rose
to 55.5 in July from 47.0 in June. The reading was also above
economists' forecast of 50.3.

The services PMI climbed to 56.7 from 47.3 in June and was above
forecast of 50.5.  
The manufacturing PMI came in at neutral 50.0 versus 45.2 in June. The
reading was forecast to rise moderately to 48.0 in July.
