Hungary's industrial production declined at the faster pace in April,
data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Friday.

Industrial production declined a working-day adjusted 36.6 percent year-
on-year in April, following a 10.0 percent decrease in March.

The economic effects caused by the Covid-19 were significant in this
period, the agency said.

On a non-adjusted basis, industrial production decreased 36.4 percent
annually in April, following a 5.6 percent fall in the preceding month.

An outstanding fall was observed in the manufacture of transport
equipment, while the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical
products, and food products, beverages and tobacco products declined to
a lesser degree, the agency said.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production fell 30.5 percent
monthly in April, following a 10.4 percent decrease in the prior month.
