UK house prices fell for a third successive month in May, though
activity started picking up slightly, after the lockdown restrictions
imposed to slow the spread of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, were
partly eased.

The house price index decreased 0.2 percent after a 0.6 percent decline
in April, monthly survey results from the Lloyds Bank subsidiary Halifax
showed Friday.

Economists had forecast a 0.7 percent fall. In March, prices slid 0.3
percent.  
The house price inflation, which is the year-on-year change in the
index, eased only slightly in May, from 2.7 percent to 2.6 percent.  
The average price of a house in May was GBP 237,808 versus GBP 238,314
in the previous month.  
In the March to May quarter, house prices dropped 0.5 percent from the
previous three months ended February, when they rose 2.8 percent.  
The successive declines in house prices reflect a continued loss of
momentum following what was a strong start to the year, Russell Galley,
Halifax managing director, said.  
With a limited number of transactions available, calculating average
house prices remains challenging and increased volatility is to be
expected, he cautioned.  
Galley pointed out that the mid-month relaxation of restrictions in
England that allowed estate agents and conveyancers to restart
operations, brought much-needed positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) with some advance
indicators of buyer and seller interest quickly showing signs of
improvement.  
"This is likely to provide a short-term boost as buyers and homeowners
attempt to kick-start transactions that had previously been put on
hold," he said.  
"Looking ahead, we expect market activity to increase progressively as
restrictions are eased further across the whole of the UK and we
continue to have confidence in the underlying [health][2] of the housing
market over the long-term."  
That said, the extent of downward pressure on market confidence and
prices over the coming months will depend on how quickly the
[economy][3] is able to recover from the effects of the pandemic and the
available government [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support for jobs and households, Galley
added.
