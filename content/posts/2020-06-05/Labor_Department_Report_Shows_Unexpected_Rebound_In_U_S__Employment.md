A closely watched report released by the Labor Department on Friday
claimed employment in the U.S. unexpectedly showed a substantial rebound
in the month of May.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 2.51
million jobs in May after plummeting by a revised 20.69 million jobs in
April.

The rebound in employment came as a shock to economists, who had
expected the loss of another 8.0 million jobs following the nosedive of
20.5 million jobs originally reported for the previous month.

With the unexpected rebound in employment, the Labor Department said the
unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent in May from 14.7 percent in
April. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to surge up to 19.8
percent.
