A closely watched report released by the Labor Department on Friday
claimed employment in the U.S. unexpectedly showed a substantial rebound
in the month of May.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 2.51
million jobs in May after plummeting by a revised 20.69 million jobs in
April.

The record spike in employment came as a shock to economists, who had
expected the loss of another 8.0 million jobs following the nosedive of
20.5 million jobs originally reported for the previous month.

Employment rose sharply in leisure and hospitality, construction,
education and [health][1] services, and retail trade, according to the
Labor Department.

Most other sectors also saw rebounds in employment, although government
employment tumbled by another 585,000 jobs, mostly reflecting local
governments laying off teachers.

The Labor Department claimed the improvements in the labor market
reflected a limited resumption of economic activity that had been
curtailed in March and April due to the [coronavirus][2] pandemic and
efforts to contain the spread of the disease.

James Knightley, Chief International Economist at ING, called the data
"simply astonishing given the slow pace of reopening and the fact that
more than 12 million people filed a new unemployment claim during the
survey period."

With the unexpected rebound in employment, the Labor Department said the
unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent in May from 14.7 percent in
April. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to surge up to 19.8
percent.

The unexpected decrease in the unemployment rate came as the household
survey found employment soared by more than 3.8 million persons compared
to the 1.7 million person increase in the size of the labor force.

However, Knightley said there are "some oddities in here," as are the
number of unemployed fell by only 2.1 million, suggesting "new workers
appear to have been magicked up out of no-where."

"The response rate was well down on usual levels so this could be adding
to the sense of confusion as well as how people self identify in the
range of responses available to them in the survey," he added.

Meanwhile, the report said average hourly employee earnings fell by
$0.29 or 1.0 percent to $29.75 in May after spiking by $1.35 or 4.7
percent to $30.04 in April.

The annual rate of average hourly earnings growth subsequently slumped
to 6.7 percent in May from 8.0 percent in the previous month.

Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, noted the
drop in average hourly earnings reflects composition effects, as low
wage workers were disproportionately fired then rehired.

A note from the Labor Department revealed the unemployment rate would
have been about 3 percentage points higher if not for the
misclassification of persons absent from work due to coronavirus-related
[business][3] closures.

"In other words, the unemployment rate in April was reported at 14.8%,
but was really 19.8%, and in May was reported as 13.3%, but was really
16.3%. The incompetence is breathtaking," said Chris Low, Chief
Economist at FHN Financial.

"The sample size of both establishment and the household reports was
smaller than usual and the household survey team misclassified millions
of unemployed as 'employed, on temporary layoff' for a third consecutive
month," he added. "Nevertheless, the gist of the report is convincing."
