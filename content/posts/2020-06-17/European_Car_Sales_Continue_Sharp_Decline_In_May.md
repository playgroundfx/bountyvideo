Europe's car registrations continued to fall sharply in May, though at a
softer rate, as the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic hurt demand
and production, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or
ACEA, reported on Wednesday.

Passenger car sales declined 52.3 percent year-on-year in May, following
a 76.3 percent fall in April. In March, sales fell 55.1 percent.

Though the Covid-19 lockdown measures were eased in many countries, the
number of cars sold across the European Union declined in May, the
agency said.

Double-digit declines were logged in 27 EU [markets][2].

Among the four major markets, demand in Spain declined the most by, down
72.7 percent. Car sales in France declined 50.3 percent. Demand in Italy
and Germany decreased by 49.6 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively.

During the January to May period, demand for new cars in the European
Union dropped by 41.5 percent.
