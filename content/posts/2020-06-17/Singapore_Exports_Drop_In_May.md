Singapore's non-oil domestic exports decreased due to weak demand for
non-electronic goods in May, data from Enterprise Singapore showed on
Wednesday.

Non-oil domestic exports decreased 4.5 percent year-on-year in May,
after a 9.7 percent rise in April. Economists had expected a 0.1 percent
fall.

Electronic NODX grew 12.5 percent, while non-electronic NODX declined
8.8 percent.

On a monthly basis, NODX declined 4.5 percent in May, following a 5.1
percent fall in the previous month.

NODX to the top [markets][1] grew in May, though exports to the EU 27,
Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand declined. The largest
contributors to the growth were the US, Japan and Taiwan.
