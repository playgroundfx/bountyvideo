Japan posted a merchandise trade deficit of 833.388 billion yen in May,

That beat forecasts for a shortfall of 970.8 billion yen following the
930 billion yen deficit in April.

Exports were down 28.3 percent on year to 4.184 trillion yen, badly
missing expectations for a decline of 17.9 percent following the 21.9
percent drop in the previous month.

Exports to the rest of Asia dropped 12.0 percent on year to 2.744
trillion yen, while exports to China alone fell 1.9 percent to 1.126
trillion yen.

Exports to the United States plummeted 50.6 percent to 588.415 billion
yen and exports to the European Union tumbled 33.8 percent to 363.839
billion yen.

Imports tumbled an annual 26.2 percent to 5.018 trillion yen versus
expectations for a fall of 15 percent after sinking 7.2 percent a month
earlier.

Imports from the rest of Asia dropped 11.8 percent on year to 2.739
trillion yen, while imports from just China sank 2.0 percent to 1.511
billion yen.

Imports from the United States dropped 27.5 percent to 578.159 billion
yen and imports from the European Union sank an annual 29.6 percent to
575.168 billion yen.
