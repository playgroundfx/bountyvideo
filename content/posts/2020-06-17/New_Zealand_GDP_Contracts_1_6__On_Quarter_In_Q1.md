New Zealand's gross domestic product shrank 1.6 percent on quarter in
the first quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday.

That missed expectations for a decline of 1.0 percent following the 0.5
percent increase in the previous three months.

Service industries were down 1.1 percent on quarter, while primary
industries fell 1.0 percent and goods-producing industries dropped 2.7
percent.

GDP per capita was down 2.2 percent and real gross disposable national
income was down 1.6 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP was up 1.5 percent - beating expectations for an
increase of 0.3 percent and slowing from 1.8 percent in the three months
prior.

Eight of the 11 service industries experienced falls in Q1, reflecting
the decline in international visitors and the impacts of the lockdown
measures on domestic activity. The alert level 4 lockdown affected the
last six days, or about 7 percent, of the first quarter. Activity was
limited to essential services only during this period. The restrictions
affected the activity of most industries.

A 5.2 percent fall in transport, postal, and warehousing services was
led by declines in air transport and transport support services. Retail,
accommodation, and restaurants fell 2.2 percent, driven by a 7.8 percent
decline in accommodation and food services. These industries were
affected by the fall in international visitors, as countries imposed
travel restrictions and closed their borders.

Education fell 1.7 percent due to the impact of the lockdown on delivery
of some education services, such as early childhood education, and
reduced international student numbers.

All three goods-producing industries were down in the March quarter.
Construction was the greatest contributor to the drop, declining 4.1
percent. Most construction activity was not deemed essential during the
alert level 4 lockdown.

Household spending declined 0.3 percent in the March 2020 quarter. This
was influenced by weaker household spending on services, with restaurant
meals and ready-to-eat food, international air passenger services, and
accommodation services all contributing to the fall.

Household spending on durable goods fell 2.8 percent, with new and used
motor vehicles contributing the most to the drop. The fall in household
spending was partly offset by a rise of 5.4 percent in spending on non-
durable goods.
