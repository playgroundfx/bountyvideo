Australia's leading index rose in May from the previous month, but it
remained in deep negative territory consistent with an economic
recession, data from the Westpac showed Wednesday.

The Westpac- Melbourne Institute Leading Index which indicates the
likely pace of economic activity relative to trend three to nine months
into the future, rose to -4.79 percent in May from -5.08 percent in
April.  
  
The indicator growth rate has weakened sharply over the last six months,
dropping to the -4.79 percent in May from -0.28 percent in December.  
  
Two components account for the bulk of the slump were US industrial
production and aggregate monthly hours worked. Both have been directly
impacted by the Covid-19 [health][1] emergency and associated shutdowns.

Other components have seen net improvements over the last six months,
adding to the index growth rate. The most notable positive contributions
have been from commodity prices, measured in AUD [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) and the yield
spread and consumer unemployment expectations.

Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac said the central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
set to remain firmly on hold for the foreseeable future.
