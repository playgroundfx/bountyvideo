New Zealand's gross domestic product contracted 1.6 percent on quarter
in the first quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday.

That missed expectations for a decline of 1.0 percent following the 0.5
percent increase in the previous three months.

Service industries were down 1.1 percent on quarter, while primary
industries fell 1.0 percent and goods-producing industries dropped 2.7
percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP was up 1.5 percent - beating expectations for an
increase of 0.3 percent and slowing from 1.8 percent in the three months
prior.
