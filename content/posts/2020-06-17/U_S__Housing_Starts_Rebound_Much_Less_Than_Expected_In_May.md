New residential construction in the U.S. showed a notable rebound in the
month of May, according to a report released by the Commerce Department
on Wednesday, although housing starts still came in well below economist
estimates.

The report said housing starts jumped by 4.3 percent to an annual rate
of 974,000 in May after plummeting by 26.4 percent to a revised rate of
934,000 in April.

Economists had expected housing starts to soar by 22.9 percent to a rate
of 1.095 million from the 891,000 originally reported for the previous
month.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said building permits spiked by 14.4
percent to an annual rate of 1.220 million in May after plunging by 21.4
percent to a revised rate of 1.066 million in April.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, had been
expected to surge up by 14.3 percent to a rate of 1.228 million from the
1.074 million originally reported for the previous month.
