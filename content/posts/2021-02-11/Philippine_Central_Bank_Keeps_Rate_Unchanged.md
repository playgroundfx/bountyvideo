The Philippine central bank left its key interest rates unchanged, as
widely expected, to support the economic recovery.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, or BSP, decided
to retain the overnight reverse repurchase facility rate at 2.00
percent.

The bank had last reduced its key rate by 25 basis points in November.
Altogether, the bank lowered the rate by 200 basis points in 2020.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
maintained at 1.50 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively.

The central bank said it remained committed to take appropriate measures
to ensure that the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance continues to support the
recovery of the [economy][1], consistent with its price and financial
stability mandate.

Although inflation is expected to remain elevated in months ahead, it is
forecast to return to the target range of 2-4 percent over the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
horizon as supply-side influences subside.

Policymakers noted that the emergence of new variants of the virus and
possible delays in mass vaccination programs continue to temper
prospects for economic recovery and growth.

While the current trend in inflation is likely to delay the central bank
from easing further, it is unlikely to stop it, Alex Holmes and Gareth
Leather, economists at Capital Economics, said.
