The euro area [economy][1] is forecast to recover at a slower-than-
expected pace this year, as the resurgence of the Covid-19 infections,
together with more contagious variants of the virus forced many
economies to tighten containment measures, the European Commission said
in its interim Winter forecast, released Thursday.

The currency bloc is expected to grow 3.8 percent this year, instead of
4.2 percent projected in the autumn forecast. However, the outlook for
2022 was lifted to 3.8 percent from 3 percent citing the start of mass
vaccination campaigns.

"Today's forecast provides real hope at a time of great uncertainty for
us all," Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy
that Works for People said. "The solid expected pick-up of growth in the
second half of this year shows very clearly that we are turning the
corner in overcoming this crisis."

The EU cautioned that projections are subject to significant uncertainty
and elevated risks, predominately linked to the evolution of the
pandemic and the success of vaccination campaigns.

The economic impact of the pandemic remains uneven across member states
and the speed of the recovery was also projected to vary significantly.

Germany's real GDP is forecast to rebound by 3.2 percent in 2021,
returning to its pre-crisis level at the turn of the year. In 2022, the
economy should continue growing by 3.1 percent, the EU said.

France's real GDP is projected to expand by 5.5 percent in 2021 and by
4.4 percent in 2022.

Italy's GDP is projected to expand by 3.4 percent in 2021. Real output
is set to grow at almost similar pace in 2022 on the back of the
momentum gained in the second half of this year on the back of continued
recovery of the services sector.

Spain's GDP is forecast to grow by 5.6 percent in 2021. In 2022, driven
by the tourism recovery, the region is set to expand 5.3 percent.

The European Union is forecast to rebound 3.7 percent this year, before
advancing 3.9 percent in 2022.

Inflation in the euro area is expected to be slightly higher in 2021
compared to last autumn, but to remain subdued despite a temporary boost
from base effects, EU said.

Inflation is seen at 1.4 percent in 2021, up from the prior forecast of
1.1 percent. As supply side adjusts and base effects taper out,
inflation is projected to moderate to 1.3 percent in 2022, which was
unchanged from the prior forecast.
