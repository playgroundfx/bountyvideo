Industrial production in Japan was up a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent
on month in June, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on
Friday.

That beat forecasts for a gain of 1.2 percent following the 8.9 percent
decline in May.

On a yearly basis, industrial production sank 17.7 percent - again
beating forecasts for a fall of 20 percent following the 26.3 percent
contraction in the previous month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI upgraded its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it has bottomed out and shows signs
of picking up movement.
