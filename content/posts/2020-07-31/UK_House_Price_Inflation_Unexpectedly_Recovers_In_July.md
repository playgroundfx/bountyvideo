UK house prices rose in July, defying expectations for further decline,
survey data from the Nationwide Building Society showed on Friday.

The house price index rose 1.5 percent year-on-year after a 0.1 percent
fall in June. Economists had forecast a 0.3 percent drop.

House prices rose 1.7 percent from June, when they fell 1.4 percent.
Economists had expected a 0.1 percent decline. The monthly increase was
the first since April.

The stamp duty holiday is likely to provide further support in the near
term, Nationwide said.
