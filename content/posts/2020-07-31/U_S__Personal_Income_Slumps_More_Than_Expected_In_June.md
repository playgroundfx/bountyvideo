June after plunging by a downwardly revised 4.4 percent in May.

Economists had expected personal income to decrease by 0.5 percent
compared to the 4.2 percent nosedive originally reported for the
previous month.

Meanwhile, the report said personal spending surged up by 5.6 percent in
June after skyrocketing by an upwardly revised 8.5 percent in May.

Personal spending had been expected to jump by 5.5 percent compared to
