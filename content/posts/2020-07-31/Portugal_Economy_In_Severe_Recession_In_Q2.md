Portugal's [economy][1] contracted massively in the second quarter amid
a sharp decline in domestic demand and exports due to the disruption
caused by the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic.  
  
Gross domestic product decreased 16.5 percent year-on-year after a 2.3
percent fall in the first quarter, preliminary figures from Statistics
Portugal showed on Friday.  
  
Two consecutive quarters of GDP decline qualifies as a technical
recession.  
The severe decline was largely due to the negative contribution from
domestic demand reflecting the significant contraction in private
consumption and investment.  
  
Net external demand also contributed negatively due to the steep fall in
exports of good and services than imports as non-resident tourism was
largely interrupted amid the lockdown.  
  
Both negative contributions were significantly more pronounced than in
the previous quarter.  
  
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP fell 14.1 percent in the three months
to June after a 3.8 percent fall in the first quarter.
