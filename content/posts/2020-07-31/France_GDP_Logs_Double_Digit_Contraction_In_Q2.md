The French [economy][1] logged a double-digit contraction in the second
quarter due to the shut-down of "non-essential" activities as part of
the lockdown implemented to battle the coronavirus pandemic until the
start of May, first estimate from the statistical office Insee showed
Friday.

Gross domestic product fell by a record 13.8 percent sequentially,
following the first quarter's 5.9 percent decrease. Economic output was
19 percent lower than in the second quarter of 2019.

This was also bigger than Germany's 10.1 percent fall. Economists had
forecast France GDP to decline 15.3 percent sequentially in the second
quarter.

The statistical office said the gradual ending of restrictions to curb
the spread of Covid-19 led to a gradual recovery of economic activity in
May and June, after the low point reached in April.

The expenditure-side breakdown of GDP showed that household spending
plunged 11 percent after a 5.8 percent drop in the first quarter.

The decline in total gross fixed capital formation was more pronounced,
which fell 17.8 percent, following a 10.3 percent decline in the
preceding period.

General government expenditure slid 8.0 percent versus a 3.5 percent
drop a quarter ago. Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory
changes contributed to -12.0 points to GDP growth.

At the same time, exports fell 25.5 percent, bigger than the 6.1 percent
decrease a quarter ago. Likewise, fall in imports deepened to 17.3
percent from 5.5 percent. All in all, the foreign trade balance
contributed negatively to GDP growth by -2.3 points.

Early this month, Insee had forecast the second largest euro area
economy to rebound about 19 percent in the third quarter and grow 3
percent in the fourth quarter.  
  
According to the Summer Forecast, released by the European Commission
this month, France's GDP will shrink 10.6 percent this year. The
economic recovery will remain on track in 2021, with GDP expanding 7.6
percent, EU said.
