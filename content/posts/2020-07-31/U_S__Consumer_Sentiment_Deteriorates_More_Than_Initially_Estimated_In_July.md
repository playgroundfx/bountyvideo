Consumer sentiment in the U.S. deteriorated by more than initially
estimated in the month of July, according to a report released by the
University of Michigan on Friday.

The report said the consumer sentiment index for July was downwardly
revised to 72.5 from the preliminary reading of 73.2. The index is down
from 78.1 in June and below economist estimates for a reading of 73.0.

"Consumer sentiment sank further in late July due to the continued
resurgence of the [coronavirus][1]," said Surveys of Consumers chief
economist Richard Curtin.

The decrease by the headline index was partly due to a drop by the index
of consumer expectations, which slumped to 65.9 in July from 72.3 in
June. The index matched the six-year low recorded in May.

The University of Michigan said the current economic conditions index
also slid to 82.8 in July from 87.1 in the previous month.

"While the 3rd quarter GDP is likely to improve over the record setting
2nd quarter plunge, it is unlikely that consumers will conclude that the
recession is anywhere near over," Curtin said.

Curtin noted federal relief programs have prevented more substantial
declines in consumer finances but warned a lapse of the special jobless
benefits will directly hurt the most vulnerable.

On the inflation front, the report said one-year inflations expectations
were unchanged from the previous month at 3.0 percent, while five-year
inflation expectations inched up to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent.
