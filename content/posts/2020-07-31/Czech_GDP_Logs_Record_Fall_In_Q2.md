The Czech Republic's [economy][1] shrank at a record pace in the second
quarter, mainly due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus, or
Covid-19, pandemic, preliminary figures from the Czech Statistical
Office showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product decreased 8.4 percent from the first quarter,
when it fell 3.4 percent. Economists were looking for a more severe
decline of 12.9 percent.

Two consecutive quarters of GDP decline qualifies as a technical
recession. The economy was last in recession during the whole of 2012
and early 2013.

On a year-on-year basis, GDP dropped 10.7 percent in the second quarter
after a 2 percent slump in the first three months of the year.
Economists had forecast a 14.7 percent decline.

The negative year-on-year GDP development was caused mainly by a marked
decrease inÂ external demand and by lower household consumption as well
as investment activity, the statistical office said.

In the second quarter, the gross value added (GVA) decreased in almost
all economic activities of the national economy, with a markedly
negative influence on the GVA coming from industry and a group of
economic activities of trade, transportation, and accommodation and food
service activities.
