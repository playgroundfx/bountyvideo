Spain's [economy][1] contracted more than expected in the second quarter
due to the coronavirus containment measures, flash data from the
statistical office INE showed Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 18.5 percent on quarter, much larger than
the 5.2 percent decrease posted in the first quarter. GDP was expected
to shrink 16.6 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP plunged 22.1 percent in contrast to a 4.1 percent
drop in the first quarter. This was also bigger than economists'
forecast of 19.7 percent decline.

The expenditure-side of GDP showed that household consumption plunged
21.2 percent sequentially, while government spending grew 0.4 percent.
At the same time, gross fixed capital formation declined 21.9 percent.

Exports of goods and services declined sharply by 33.5 percent and
imports were down 28.8 percent.
