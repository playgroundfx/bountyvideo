Italy's industrial production rose for a second straight month in
October, but the pace of growth was slower than expected, preliminary
data from the statistical office ISTAT showed Friday.  
  
The [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)-adjusted industrial production index rose 2.0 percent year-
on-year following a 4.5 percent climb in September, revised from 4.4
percent. Output had declined 0.1 percent in August.  
  
Economists had forecast a 3.3 percent increase.  
  
Production of intermediate goods grew 3.4 percent and that of consumer
goods increased 2.7 percent. Energy output rose 1.8 percent, while
manufacture of capital goods decreased 0.1 percent.  
  
Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products, the wood, paper and
printing goods, the food, beverages and tobacco products, and machinery
and equipment increased in October.

Declines were seen in the manufacture of means of transport, mining
activities, computers and electronics products, and in other
manufacturing industries.

The unadjusted industrial production index decreased 1.1 percent
annually in October after a 4.6 percent increase in the previous month.  
  
The seasonally adjusted industrial production index fell 0.6 percent
from September, when output grew 0.1 percent. The latest decline was the
