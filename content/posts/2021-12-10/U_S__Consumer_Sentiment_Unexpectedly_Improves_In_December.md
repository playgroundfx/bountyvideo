Consumer sentiment in the U.S. unexpectedly improved in early December,
according to preliminary data released by the University of Michigan on
Friday.

The report said the consumer sentiment index climbed to 70.4 in December
after dropping to a ten-year low of 67.4 in November. The rebound
surprised economists, who had expected the index to edge down to 67.1.

Despite the unexpected increase by the index, Surveys of Consumers chief
economist Richard Curtin noted the reading was nearly identical to the
average in the prior four months of 70.6.

"The more interesting result was the large disparity between monthly
gain among households with incomes in the lowest third (+23.6%) of the
income distribution compared with the modest losses among households in
the middle (-3.8%) and top third (-4.3%)," Curtin said.

He added, "While small differences in the direction of change are rather
common, it is quite unusual to record such a large change in the bottom
third."

Curtin said such extreme changes are usually assumed to represent an
erroneous result due to small samples but noted the only larger one-
month percentage change signaled the end of the first part of the double
recession in 1980-82.

The unexpected increase by the headline consumer sentiment index was
partly due to a notable improvement in consumer expectations.

The index of consumer expectations jumped to 67.8 in December from 63.5
in November, while the current economic conditions index edged up to
74.6 from 73.6.

The report also showed both one-year and five-year inflation
expectations were unchanged from the previous month at 4.9 percent and
3.0 percent, respectively.

"When directly asked whether inflation or unemployment was the more
serious problem facing the nation, 76% selected inflation while just 21%
selected unemployment," Curtin said. "The dominance of inflation over
unemployment was true for all income, age, education, region, and
political subgroups."

He added, "While a shift in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) emphasis is necessary, it will be
difficult to gauge the right balance between fiscal and monetary
policies that both trims inflation and maintains the unemployment rate
near its current lows."
