The Czech consumer price inflation accelerated for the fifth month in a
row in November, data from the Czech Statistical Office revealed on
Friday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 6.0 percent in November from 5.8
percent in October.

This acceleration of price growth came mainly from higher prices in
transport.

Prices of goods in total and services went up 5.0 percent and 7.5
percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.2 percent in November,
while economists had expected a rise of 0.8 percent.
