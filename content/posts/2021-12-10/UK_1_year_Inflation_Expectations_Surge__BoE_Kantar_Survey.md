UK inflation expectations for the coming year surged and more
respondents expect interest rates to increase over the next 12 months,
results of a quarterly survey by the Bank of England and market research
firm Kantar showed Friday.

Median expectations of the rate of inflation over the coming year
climbed to 3.2 percent from 2.7 percent in the August survey.

The survey showed that 60 percent of respondents expected rates to rise
over the next 12 months, up from 43 percent in August.  
  
The central bank's latest quarterly survey of public attitudes to
inflation, was undertaken between November 9 and 15.
