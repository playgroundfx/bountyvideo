UK mortgage approvals increased sharply in June as the housing market
reopened after the relaxation of restrictions to curb the spread of the
[coronavirus][1], data from the Bank of England showed Wednesday.

The number of mortgages approved in June rose to a three-month high of
40,000 in June from a record low 9,300 in May. Approvals were expected
to rise to 33,900. However, the latest figure was below February's pre-
Covid level of 73,700.

Lending to individuals increased GBP 1.8 billion in June in contrast to
a fall of GBP 3.3 billion in May. On a yearly basis, lending grew 2.1
percent.

Households borrowed an additional GBP 1.9 billion secured on their
homes. This was higher than the GBP1.3 billion in May.

House purchase mortgage approvals saw a strong initial recovery in June,
Hansen Lu, an economist at Capital Economics, said. Lending is likely to
strengthen further this year, as the stamp duty cut supports demand and
lenders bring back higher LTV loans, he noted.

All this supports the assessment that the risk of a house price collapse
has now diminished significantly, the economist added.

Data showed that household's consumer credit borrowing recovered a
little in June, following three particularly weak months. Consumer
credit was down GBP 0.1 billion.

The weakness in consumer credit net flows in recent months meant that
the annual growth rate was -3.6 percent, the weakest since the series
began in 1994, the BoE said.

Further, the monthly growth in the M4 money supply slowed to 1 percent
in June from 2.1 percent in May. Year-on-year, M4 advanced 13.1 percent
in June.
