Hong Kong's [economy][1] continued to shrink at a sharp rate in the
second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic hurt demand, advance
estimates from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product decreased 9 percent year-on-year after a 9.1
percent slump in the first three months of the year.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, GDP fell 3 percent.

The economy has now shrunk for four consecutive quarters.

The latest decline of GDP was mainly attributable to the continued weak
performance in both domestic and external demand, the statistical office
said.

Compared to the previous quarter, GDP fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1
percent in the second quarter.
