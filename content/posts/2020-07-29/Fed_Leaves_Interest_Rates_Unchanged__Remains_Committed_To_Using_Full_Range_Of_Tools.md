In a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that
interest rates will remain at near-zero levels amid the economic
hardship imposed by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The Fed said it decided to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent, where it has remained since an
emergency rate cut on March 15.

The accompanying statement noted economic activity and employment have
picked up somewhat in recent months following sharp declines but remain
well below their levels at the beginning of the year.

The central bank partly attributed the recent improvement in overall
financial conditions to [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures to support the [economy][2] and
the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

The Fed also reiterated that it remains committed to using its full
range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time.

In addition to keeping interest rates at current levels until it is
confident the economy has weathered recent events, the Fed said it will
also continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency
residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the
current pace.

The unanimous decision to leave rates unchanged was widely expected,
although some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may be disappointed the Fed's statement did not
provide specific clues about further stimulus.

"The biggest surprise was no explicit forward guidance," said FHN
Financial chief economist Chris Low. "It's likely the Fed's logic was
the same as we anticipated regarding QE."

"The FOMC is ready to do it, but there was no point doing it today," he
added. "Interest rates are low enough without additional help from the
Fed."

The Fed's statement did include a new sentence noting the path of the
economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, which Fed
Chair Jerome Powell highlighted in his post-meeting press conference.

On Tuesday, the Fed announced a three-month extension of its lending
facilities that were scheduled to expire on or around September 30.

The central bank said the extension through December 31 will facilitate
planning by potential facility participants and provide certainty that
the facilities will continue to be available to help the economy recover
from the COVID-19 pandemic.
