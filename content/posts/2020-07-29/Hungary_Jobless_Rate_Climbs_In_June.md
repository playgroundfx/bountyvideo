Hungary's unemployment rate rose during the April to June period, data
from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Wednesday.

The jobless rate rose to 4.6 percent during the April to June period
from 4.1 percent during the March to May period.

The economic consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic had affected the
study period entirely, so their effects are reflected in the reported
data, the agency said.

The number of unemployed persons increased by 25,000 to 214,200 during
the April to June period from 190,200 in the previous three months.

The youth unemployment rate was 14.7 percent in the three months ended
June.

The employment rate fell slightly to 59.5 during April to June from 59.4
percent in the preceding three months.
