Fitch Ratings downgraded Japan's sovereign rating outlook citing the
sharp economic contraction caused by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The outlook on 'A' rating was lowered to 'negative' from 'stable'.

The agency observed that a downturn in consumer spending and
[business][2] investment has been exacerbated by a steep decline in
exports associated with weak external demand.

The [economy][3] is forecast to contract 5 percent in 2020, before
rebounding to 3.2 percent growth in 2021 due partly to the low base
effect. However, the economy would not recover to its pre-pandemic level
until the fourth quarter of 2021, Fitch said.

"The Negative Outlook indicates that the higher debt ratio and downside
risks to the macroeconomic outlook will nevertheless exacerbate the
challenge of placing the debt ratio on a downward path over the medium
term," the agency added.

According to Fitch, Japan's gross general government debt ratio will
rise to around 259 percent of GDP this year, and stabilize just above
260 percent in 2021-22, before turning to a gradual downward path.

The rating agency projected the deficit to narrow to 10.9 percent of GDP
in 2021 and 5.3 percent in 2022, as the recovery gradually solidifies
and the authorities seek to return to their path of debt reduction.

Last month, S&P Global Ratings had lowered its outlook on Japan's rating
to 'stable' from 'positive' citing government spending amid pandemic.
