Japan will on Monday release preliminary Q4 numbers for gross domestic
product, setting the pace for a busy day in Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

GDP is expected to rise 2.3 percent on quarter and 9.5 percent on year
after jumping 5.3 percent on quarter and 22.9 percent on year in the
three months prior.

Japan also will see final December figures for industrial production;
the previous reading suggested a decline of 0.5 percent on month and 3.9
percent on year.

Indonesia will release January data for imports, exports and trade
balance. Imports are expected to sink 2.77 percent on year after easing
0.47 percent in December. Exports are called higher by an annual 13.59
percent after gaining 14.63 percent in the previous month. The trade
surplus is pegged at $1.68 billion, down from $2.1 billion a month
earlier.

Thailand will provide Q4 numbers for gross domestic product, with
forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.8 percent on quarter and a decline
of 5.4 percent on year. That follows the 6.5 percent quarterly increase
and the 6.4 percent yearly drop in Q3.

New Zealand will see January results for the Performance of Service
Index from BusinessNZ; in December, the index score was 49.2.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong remain closed
