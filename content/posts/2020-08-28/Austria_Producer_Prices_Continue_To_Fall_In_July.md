Austria's producer prices declined further in July, figures from
Statistics Austria showed on Friday.

The producer price index declined 2.1 percent year-on-year in July, same
as seen in June.

The decline in producer prices was mainly driven by a fall in energy
prices and intermediate goods by 7.2 percent and 2.2 percent,
respectively.

Meanwhile, prices for capital goods rose 0.7 percent in July and those
for consumer goods increased 0.9 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.1 percent in July, following
a 0.2 percent increase in the preceding month.
