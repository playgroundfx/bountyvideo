Germany's import prices declined in July, albeit at a softer pace, data
from Destatis revealed on Friday.

Import prices declined 4.6 percent year-on-year in July, following a 5.1
percent decrease in June. Economists had expected a 4.7 percent fall.

The annual fall was largely driven by a 31.5 percent decline in energy
prices.

Excluding energy, import prices fell 1.4 percent in July from last year.

On a monthly basis, import prices rose 0.3 percent in July, after a 0.6
percent decline in the prior month. Prices were forecast to rise 0.2
percent.

Data showed that export prices fell 1.1 percent annually, following a
1.0 percent decline in June. On a monthly basis, export prices remained
unchanged in July.
