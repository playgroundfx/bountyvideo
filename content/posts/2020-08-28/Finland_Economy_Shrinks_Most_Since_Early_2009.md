Finland's [economy][1] contracted in the second quarter at the fastest
pace since the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and sank deeper into a
severe recession, as the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic disrupted
economic activity, preliminary data from Statistics Finland showed
Friday.

Gross domestic product decreased a seasonally adjusted 4.5 percent from
the first quarter, when the economy contracted 1.9 percent. The economy
shrunk for a third quarter in a row.

The latest contraction was the worst since a 6.5 percent decline in the
first quarter of 2009.

The second quarter shrinkage was earlier estimated at 3.2 percent. The
first quarter contraction was revised from a 0.9 percent fall.

The economy had entered a technical recession, which is two consecutive
quarters of GDP decline, in the first three months of 2020.

Exports decreased 8.7 percent and imports fell 9.8 percent. Private
consumption declined 6.9 percent and gross fixed capital formation
shrunk 0.6 percent.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, GDP declined a working-day adjusted 6.4 percent
in the second quarter, which was much severe than the 4.9 percent
decrease estimated earlier.

The annual fall in the first quarter was 1.3 percent, revised from 1.1
percent.
