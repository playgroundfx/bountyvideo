Germany's consumer confidence is set to weaken in September after three
months of improvement, and defied expectations for a strong gain as
income expectations deteriorated, survey data from the market researcher
GfK showed on Friday.  
  
The forward-looking consumer confidence index for September dropped to
-1.8 from -0.2 in August, which was revised from -0.3. Economists had
expected a positive reading of 1.2.  
  
The weakening of consumer confidence was led by the drop in the income
expectations index that fell to 12.8 in August from 18.6 in July.

Economic expectations, propensity to buy as well as saving intentions
showed modest gains.

"An increase in the number of infections and the fear that
[coronavirus][1]-related restrictions will be further tightened are
creating uncertainty and consequently dampening the mood," Rolf Bürkl,
consumer expert at GfK, said.

The reduction in value added tax (VAT) which came into effect in Germany
on July 1 may be boosting propensity to consume but has not yet been
able to provide a stronger stimulus, the analyst said.

"Whether or not this is just a temporary slowdown will depend primarily
on what infection rates look like in future and the necessary measures
to be put in place by [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) makers," Bürkl added.
