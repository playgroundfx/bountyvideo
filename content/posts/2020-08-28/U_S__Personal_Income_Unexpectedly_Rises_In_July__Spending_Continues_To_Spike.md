With employees returning to work as the [economy][1] continued to
reopen, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing U.S.
personal income unexpectedly increased in the month of July.

The report said personal income rose by 0.4 percent in July after
slumping by 1.0 percent in June. The rebound surprised economists, who
had expected income to dip by another 0.2 percent.

The Commerce Department said the unexpected uptick in personal income
was more than accounted for by compensation of employees as portions of
the economy continued to reopen

Proprietors' income and rental income also contributed to the increase,
while the growth was partly offset by decreases in government social
benefits and income on assets.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, edged up by 0.2 percent in July after tumbling 1.3 percent in
June.

The report also showed a continued surge in personal spending, which
jumped by 1.9 percent in July after spiking by 6.2 percent in the
previous month. Economists had expected spending to increase by 1.5
percent.

"The 1.9% advance in July consumer spending offers yet another sign that
while the demand recovery remains on track, it has settled into a slower
pace," said Lydia Boussour, Senior U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Looking ahead, consumption should continue to firm as
conditions very slowly normalize but the steep decline in federal
support for unemployed workers and heightened uncertainty will depress
consumer confidence and spending and weigh on the broader economic
recovery."

Excluding price changes, personal spending still surged up by 1.6
percent in July after soaring by 5.7 percent in June.

With spending jumping by much more than income, personal saving as a
percentage of disposable personal income fell to 17.8 percent in July
from 19.2 in June.
