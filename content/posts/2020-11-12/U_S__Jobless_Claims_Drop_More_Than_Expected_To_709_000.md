A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a bigger
than expected decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment
benefits in the week ended November 7th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 709,000, a
decrease of 48,000 from the previous week's revised level of 757,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 735,000 from the
751,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims fell to their
lowest level since before lockdowns were imposed in mid-March.

The report said the less volatile four-week moving average also slid to
755,250, a decrease of 33,250 from the previous week's revised average
of 788,500.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 436,000 to 6.786 million in the
week ended October 31st.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims slumped to 7,575,750,
a decrease of 653,000 from the previous week's revised average of
8,228,750.

"Continuing claims for regular benefits extended their decline, but that
positive trend continues to be partly offset by the rise in the number
of unemployed individuals who have exhausted those benefits," said Nancy
Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
employment in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the month of
October.

The report said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 638,000 jobs in
October after surging up by a revised 672,000 jobs in September.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 600,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 661,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate dropped to 6.9
percent in October from 7.9 percent in September. The unemployment rate
was expected to slip to 7.7 percent.
