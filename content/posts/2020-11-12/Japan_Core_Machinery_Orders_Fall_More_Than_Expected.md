Japan core machinery orders declined more than expected in September
weighing on the prospects of a sustained recovery in [business][1]
investment.

Core machinery orders declined 4.4 percent on a monthly basis, in
contrast to a 0.2 percent rise in August, data published by the Cabinet
Office showed Thursday. This was the first fall in three months and
worse than economists' forecast of 0.7 percent drop.

Year-on-year, core machinery orders were down 11.5 percent versus an
expected fall of 11.6 percent.

Overall machinery orders also dropped 4.4 percent on month in September,
reversing a 19.8 percent expansion posted in the previous month.

In the September quarter, the total value of machinery orders received
by 280 manufacturers increased 7.8 percent from the previous three
months.

Manufacturers expect overall machinery orders to fall 7.8 percent and
core machinery orders to drop 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

Across this year non-residential investment is likely to have fallen by
around 6.5 percent, Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics,
said. And while the early distribution of an effective vaccine presents
an upside risk, the recovery is likely to be lacklustre in 2021.

Another report from the Bank of Japan showed that producer prices
continued to show negative growth in October.

Producer prices decreased 2.1 percent annually, following a 0.8 percent
drop in September. Prices have been falling since March.  
  
Month-on-month, producer prices slid 0.2 percent in October, the same
rate of fall as registered in September.
