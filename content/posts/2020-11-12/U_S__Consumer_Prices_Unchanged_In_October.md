Reflecting many offsetting increases and decreases, the Labor Department
released a report on Thursday showing U.S. consumer prices came in flat
in the month of October.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index was unchanged in
October after rising by 0.2 percent in September. Economists had
expected another 0.2 percent uptick.

Excluding food and energy prices, consumer prices were still flat in
October after edging up by 0.2 percent in September. Core prices were
also expected to inch up by another 0.2 percent.
