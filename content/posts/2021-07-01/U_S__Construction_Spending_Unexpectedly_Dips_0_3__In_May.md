Construction spending in the U.S. unexpectedly decreased in the month of
May, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Thursday.

The report said construction spending fell by 0.3 percent to an annual
rate of $1.545 trillion in May after inching up by 0.1 percent to a
revised rate of $1.550 trillion in April.

The decrease surprised economists, who had expected construction
spending to rise by 0.4 percent following the 0.2 percent uptick
originally reported for the previous month.

The unexpected drop in construction spending came as spending on private
construction slipped by 0.3 percent to an annual rate of $1.203 billion.

Spending on non-residential construction slumped by 1.1 percent to a
rate of $451.6 billion, more than offsetting a 0.2 percent increase in
spending on residential construction to a rate of $751.7 billion.

The report showed spending on public construction also dipped by 0.2
percent to a rate of $342.0 billion, as a steep drop in spending on
educational construction more than offset a jump in spending on highway
construction.

Despite the monthly decrease, total construction spending in May was up
by 7.5 percent compared to the same month a year ago.
