Ireland's manufacturing sector expanded at a softer pace in June, survey
data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The seasonally adjusted AIB factory Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
fell to 64.0 in June from 64.1 in May. Any reading above 50.0 indicates
expansion in the sector.

New orders and stocks of purchases rose to a record high in June and
output increased to the second highest on record.

Employment grew to the third-highest on record. Backlogs of work rose
for the fourth straight month and suppliers' delivery time lengthened in
June.

Input price inflation rose to the second-highest on record and resulted
in an unpredictable increase in output prices.

"Meanwhile, the 12-month outlook for production remained upbeat, but
fell back appreciably from May on concerns that the current very strong
rebound in demand would not be sustained to mid-2022," Oliver Mangan,
AIB chief economist, said.
