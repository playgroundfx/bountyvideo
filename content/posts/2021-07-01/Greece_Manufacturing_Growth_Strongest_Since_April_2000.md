Greece's manufacturing activity increased at the strongest rate since
April 2000, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 58.6 in June from
58.0 in May. A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

New order inflow increased in June and new sales was the quickest for
twenty-one years. New export sales grew at the sharpest pace since
February last year.

Output increased in June and the rate of expansion was the second-
fastest since February last year.

Input price inflation rose for the eleventh straight month in June and
selling price inflation was the quickest since the survey began in
November 2002.

Employment growth was the strongest since the pandemic began and
backlogs of work quickened in June.

Output expectation for the coming 12 months moderated slightly in June
and the degree of optimism was above the series average.

"That said, efforts to retain customers and stabilize order inflows mean
that our current forecast for CPI remains at 0.3 percent year-on-year in
2021," Sian Jones, senior economist at IHS Markit, said.
