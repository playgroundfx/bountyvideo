The UK manufacturing sector logged a strong growth in June but the pace
of expansion moderated from a record high, final survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Thursday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index dropped slightly to 63.9 in June from May's record high
of 65.6. The reading was below the flash estimate of 64.2.

The indicator has remained above the neutral 50.0 for 13 successive
months, signaling growth in the sector.

Production increased at marked rates across the consumer, intermediate
and investment goods industries in June. Growth was supported by strong
intakes of new [business][1], which rose at a rate close to May's record
high.

New export orders increased again, reflecting inflows of new work from
mainland Europe, the US and Asia.

Employment advanced at a rate close to May's record high in June. Almost
63 percent of companies expect production to rise over the coming year,
indicating reduced uncertainty regarding COVID-19 and Brexit and
improving global market conditions.  
  
Data showed that the industry was still beset by supply-chain and
distribution difficulties, however, leading to longer vendor lead times
and disruption to production schedules.

Average input costs rose at the fastest pace in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The
pass-through of higher input costs led to the fastest increase in
selling prices since charges data were first collected in November 1999.

"The continued inflationary impact of capacity issues at both
manufacturers and their suppliers will be a further factor keeping
headline inflation above the Bank of England's 2% target in coming
months," Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said.
