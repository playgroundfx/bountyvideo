A day ahead of the release of the more closely watched monthly jobs
report, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing
first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits fell by more than
expected in the week ended June 26th.

The report said initial jobless claims slid to 364,000, a decrease of
51,000 from the previous week's revised level of 415,000.

Economist had expected jobless claims to dip to 393,000 from the 411,000
originally reported for the previous week.

With the bigger than expected decrease, jobless claims fell to their
lowest level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended March 14, 2020.
