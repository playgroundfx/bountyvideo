Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the bank should not over-
react to temporarily high inflation in order to safeguard the recovery.

At the Mansion House speech on Thursday, Bailey said the rise in
inflation is set to be a temporary feature of the bounce-back. A
premature tightening of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to contain inflation will undermine the
economic recovery, he noted.

However, the bank will continue to watch the outlook for inflation and
in case of signs of more persistent inflation pressure, the bank is
prepared to respond with the tools of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the governor
said.

At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting last week, the bank forecast inflation to
exceed 3 percent temporarily, and to fall back once the impact of rising
commodity prices prove transitory.

The governor said there are at least three reasons why the increase in
inflation should be temporary. First, there are annual inflation base
effects caused by very weak activity and prices last year which will not
last beyond a year as a matter of arithmetic.

Second, additional price pressures can arise from the various shortages
caused by imbalances in the recovery of supply and demand, as the latter
recovers more rapidly than the former. But these imbalances should not
last.

Third, the bank expects to see switch from demand for goods towards
services as restrictions are lifted, which should rebalance the
composition of demand. Over time, this should lead to an easing of
inflation as spending is redirected towards sectors with more spare
capacity.

Bailey said the [economy][1] will revert to the lower average underlying
growth rates. "Reverting to the pre-Covid pattern of lower trend growth
will bring its own challenges," Bailey observed.
