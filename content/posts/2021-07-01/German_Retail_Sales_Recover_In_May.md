Germany's retail sales recovered in May driven by the easing of
restrictions related to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, data published by
Destatis revealed on Thursday.

Retail sales grew 4.2 percent month-on-month in May, in contrast to a
6.8 percent decrease in April. But this was slower than the 5 percent
increase expected by economists.

On a yearly basis, retail turnover was down 2.4 percent, in contrast to
April's 5.1 percent rise.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales gained 4.5 percent on month but dropped
0.6 percent from the same period last year.

Food, beverages and tobacco sales dropped 2.9 percent annually and non-
food turnover decreased 2.2 percent.
