The Dutch manufacturing sector growth slowed in June, but the pace of
expansion remained strong, survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Thursday.

The NEVI manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, decreased to
68.8 in June from 69.4 in May. Any reading above 50.0 indicates
expansion in the sector.

New orders and output increased further in June. Purchasing activity
increased at a softer pace.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in June and backlogs of work rose
for the seventh month in a row. The rate of job creation was the fastest
since March 2018.

Input price inflation rose to a record high in June and selling prices
increased for the eleventh month in a row, with the rate of inflation
steepest on record.

For the next 12 months, firms remained highly optimistic regarding the
output in June.

"It seems that supply chains might be disrupted more often by quarantine
measures until staff in the transportation sector has been fully
vaccinated in all major economies," Albert Jan Swart, manufacturing
sector economist at ABN AMRO, said.
