Eurozone consumer confidence rose improved more-than-expected in
September to its highest level in six months, preliminary data from the
European Commission showed on Tuesday.  
  
The flash consumer confidence index climbed to -13.9 from -14.7 in
August. Economists had expected a score of -14.6.  
  
The latest reading was the highest since March, when it was at -11.6.  
  
The corresponding index for EU rose to -14.9 from -15.5 in August. That
is also the highest since March, when the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19,
pandemic was just starting to spread in the region.

The final readings are slated to be released along with the economic
sentiment data on September 29.
