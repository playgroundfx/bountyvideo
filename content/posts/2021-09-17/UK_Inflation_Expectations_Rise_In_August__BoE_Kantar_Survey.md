Britons' inflation expectations for the coming year increased in August,
the latest Bank of England/Kantar Inflation Attitudes Survey showed on
Friday.

Inflation for the coming year was seen at 2.7 percent versus 2.4 percent
in May. Inflation expectations for the twelve months after that climbed
to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in the prior survey period.

For the longer-term, say in five years' time, inflation is expected to
rise to 3 percent from 2.7 percent. Expectations remained above the
central bank's inflation target of 2 percent.

By a margin of 46 percent to 13 percent, survey respondents believed
that the [economy][1] would end up weaker, rather than stronger, if
prices started to rise faster. This compares with margins of 41 percent
to 13 percent in May.

About 31 percent of respondents expected interest rates to stay about
the same over the next twelve months, compared with 37 percent in May
and around 43 percent expected rates to rise over the next 12 months, up
from 39 percent in May.

The quarterly survey was conducted by Kantar on behalf of the Bank of
England, between August 10 and 16.
