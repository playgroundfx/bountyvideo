UK retail sales declined for the fourth straight month in August, data
from the Office for National Statistics showed on Friday.  
  
Retail sales including auto fuel dropped unexpectedly by 0.9 percent
month-on-month after declining 2.8 percent in July. Sales were forecast
to climb 0.5 percent.

Excluding auto fuel, the retail sales volume decreased at a slower pace
of 1.2 percent following a 3.2 percent drop in July. Economists had
expected an increase of 0.5 percent.

Food store sales decreased 1.2 percent and non-food store sales were
down 1 percent in August.

On a yearly basis, retail sales remained flat versus July's 1.9 percent
increase and the expected growth of 2.5 percent.

At the same time, sales excluding auto fuel were down 0.9 percent,
offsetting the 0.9 percent increase in July. Sales were expected to
