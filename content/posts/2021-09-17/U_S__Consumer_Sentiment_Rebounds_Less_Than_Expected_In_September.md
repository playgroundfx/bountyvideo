Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has seen a modest improvement in
September after falling sharply in August, according to a preliminary
report released by the University of Michigan on Friday.

The report said the consumer sentiment index inched up by 71.0 in
September from 70.3 in August. Economists had expected the index to rise
to 72.2.

The modest increase came after the consumer sentiment index tumbled to
its lowest level since December of 2011 in the previous month.

"The steep August falloff in consumer sentiment ended in early
September, but the small gain still meant that consumers expected the
least favorable economic prospects in more than a decade," said Surveys
of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin.

The uptick by the headline index came as the index of consumer
expectations crept up to 67.1 in September from 65.1 in August.

On the other hand, the report said the current economic conditions index
edged down to 77.1 in September from 78.5 in August.

The report also showed one-year inflation expectations inched up to 4.7
percent in September from 4.6 percent in August, while five-year
inflation expectations were unchanged at 2.9 percent.

"Consumers have initially reacted by viewing the rise in inflation as
transitory, believing that prices will stabilize or could even fall in
the future," Curtin said.

"As a result, postponing purchases is seen as a viable strategy," he
added. "This implies a slowdown of spending in the months ahead and a
more robust rebound later in 2022."
