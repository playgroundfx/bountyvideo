Slovakia's EU measure of inflation increased in August, data from the
Statistical Office Of the Slovak Republic showed on Friday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 3.3 percent year-
on-year in August, after 2.9 percent gain in July. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

On a month-on-month basis, increased 0.2 percent in August, following a
0.5 percent gain in the preceding month. Economists had expected a 0.3
percent rise.

Earlier, the statistical office reported that the consumer price index
rose 3.8 percent yearly in August and gained 0.4 percent from a month
ago.

The core inflation rose to 4.5 percent in August from 3.9 percent in the
prior month.
