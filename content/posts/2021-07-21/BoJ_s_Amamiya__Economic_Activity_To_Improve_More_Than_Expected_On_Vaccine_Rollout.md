Acceleration in the vaccine rollout will help Japan's economic activity
to improve more than expected, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan
Amamiya Masayoshi said on Wednesday.

In other countries where vaccinations are progressing ahead of Japan
indicates that private consumption, including that of face-to-face
services, is expected to pick up again in Japan, Amamiya said at a
meeting with local leaders in Niigata.

It is projected that the virtuous cycle that has started to operate in
the corporate sector will spread to the household sector, thereby
intensifying the cycle in the overall [economy][1], he said.

Further, corporate profits are forecast to continue improving on the
whole on the back of a recovery in domestic and external demand, despite
being pushed down by cost increases. An uptrend in [business][2] fixed
investment is expected to become clear, Amamiya noted.

The risks to the outlook for economic activity are skewed to the
downside for the time being, Amamiya observed.

The banker said the bank will pay attention to future price development
and their impact on the economy. The BoJ will continue to closely
examine developments in economic activity at home and abroad, he added.
