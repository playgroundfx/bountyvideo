Japan posted a merchandise trade surplus of 383.2 billion yen in June,
the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of 460 billion yen following
the downwardly revised 189.4 billion yen deficit in May (originally a
187.1 billion yen deficit).

Imports jumped 32.7 percent on year to 6.837 trillion yen - exceeding
expectations for a gain of 29 percent after climbing 27.9 percent in the
previous month.

Exports surged an annual 48.6 percent, beating forecasts for a gain of
46.2 percent after rising 49.6 percent a month earlier.
