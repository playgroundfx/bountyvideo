The UK budget deficit narrowed in June as the [economy][1] started to
recover, yet the borrowing was the second-highest on record for the
month, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.

The public sector net borrowing decreased GBP 5.5 billion from the last
year to GBP 22.8 billion in June and was below the Office for Budget
Responsibility's forecast of GBP 25.2 billion.

Nonetheless, this was the second-highest June borrowing since monthly
records began in 1993 and exceeded the economists' forecast of GBP 21.5
billion.

In June, central government receipts grew 18 percent annually, while the
expenditure rose only 3.1 percent.

Interest payments on central government debt came in at GBP 8.7 billion
in June, which was the highest monthly payment on record.

In the financial year-to-June period, public sector net borrowing
decreased by GBP 49.8 billion from the last year to GBP 69.5 billion.
But this was the second-highest financial year-to-June borrowing since
monthly records began in 1993, the ONS said.

Official forecasts suggested that borrowing may reach GBP 233.9 billion
by the end of the financial year ending March 2022.  
  
At the end of June, public sector net debt, excluding public sector
banks was GBP 2,218.2 billion or around 99.7 percent of GDP, the highest
ratio since the 102.5 percent recorded in March 1961.

While debt service costs will probably stay higher than the Office for
Budget Responsibility estimated over next few years, the public finances
should continue to reap the benefits of a faster and fuller recovery in
GDP than the OBR expects, meaning that the deficit should still fall
faster, Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
