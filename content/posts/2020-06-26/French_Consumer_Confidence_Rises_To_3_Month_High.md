French consumer confidence improved to a three-month high in June as
[coronavirus][1] containment measures were relaxed, survey data from the
statistical office Insee showed Friday.

Although the score was above economists' forecast of 95, the reading was
below its long-term average of 100.

The share of households considering it is a suitable time to make major
purchases increased sharply with the corresponding balance gaining 31
points to -14 in June.

Consumers' assessment of future financial situation increased
significantly by 12 points to -8. At the same time, the balance related
to their past financial situation lost 2 points to -12 in June.

The assessment of future standard of living increased sharply to -52. At
the same time, the index measuring the past standard of living in France
improved to -56 from -49.

Households' fears about the unemployment trend have increased slightly
in June. The corresponding balance climbed 2 points to 78, the highest
since June 2013 peak level.

Further, the survey showed that households considering that prices will
be on rise during the next twelve months have been markedly less
numerous than the previous month. The corresponding balance climbed 17
points to -13 in June.  
  
Households considering that prices were on the rise over the past year
