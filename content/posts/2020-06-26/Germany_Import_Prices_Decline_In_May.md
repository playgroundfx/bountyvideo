Germany's import prices declined notably in May but the annual pace of
fall slowed from April, data published by Destatis revealed Friday.

Import prices decreased 7 percent on a yearly basis in May, slower than
the 7.4 percent drop seen in April.

Month-on-month, import prices advanced 0.3 percent, the first rise seen
so far this year. Prices had declined 1.8 percent in April.

Excluding energy, import prices fell 0.2 percent on month and declined
1.3 percent from the same period last year. Energy prices logged an
annual fall of 50.6 percent, while increased 9 percent on month.

At the same time, export prices declined 1.2 percent from last year
after easing 1.1 percent in April. This was the biggest fall since July
2016, when prices were down 1.5 percent.

On a monthly basis, the decline in export prices halved to 0.2 percent
from 0.4 percent.
