Import prices in the U.S. showed another notable increase in the month
of March, according to a report released by the Labor Department on
Wednesday.

The report said import prices surged up by 1.2 percent in March after
jumping by 1.3 percent in February. Economists had expected import
prices to climb by 1.0 percent.

The Labor Department noted import prices spiked by 4.1 percent from
December to March, reflecting the largest three-month increase since May
of 2011.

Prices for fuel imports continued to lead the way higher, soaring by 6.3
percent in March after skyrocketing by 11.7 percent in February.

Excluding pries for fuel imports, import prices climbed by 0.8 percent
in March after rising by 0.5 percent in the previous month.

The increase reflected higher prices for non-fuel industrial supplies
and materials, foods, feeds, and beverages, capital goods and consumer
goods.

"Soaring commodity prices and strong base effects will continue to boost
import prices in the coming months," said Kathy Bostjancic, Chief U.S.
Financial Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "However, the acceleration in import inflation should be
temporary and trend lower in the second half of the year."

The report also said export prices jumped by 2.1 percent in March after
shooting up by 1.6 percent in February. Export prices were expected to
increase by 1.0 percent.

Prices for agricultural exports surged up by 2.4 percent in March after
spiking by 2.8 percent in February, reflecting higher prices for meat,
soybeans, fruit, and cotton.

The Labor Department said prices for non-agricultural exports also shot
up by 2.9 percent in March following a 1.5 percent jump in February.

The March increase was led by higher prices for non-agricultural
industrial supplies and materials, consumer goods, capital goods, and
non-agricultural foods.

Compared to the same month a year ago, import prices in March were up by
6.9 percent, reflecting the biggest jump since January of 2012.

Export prices in March were up by 9.1 percent year-over-year, the
largest annual spike since September of 2011.
