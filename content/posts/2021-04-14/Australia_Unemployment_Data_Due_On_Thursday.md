Australia will on Thursday release March figures for unemployment,
setting the pace for a modest day in Asia-Pacific economic activity.

The jobless rate is expected to fall to 5.7 percent from 5.8 percent in
February, with the addition of 35,000 jobs after gaining 88,700 jobs in
the previous month. The participation rate is called steady at 66.1
percent.

The Bank of Korea will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting and then
announce its decision on interest rates. The central bank is widely
expected to leave its benchmark lending rate unchanged at the record low
of 0.50 percent.

New Zealand will provide March figures for food inflation; in February,
food prices were up 1.2 percent on year.

Indonesia will release March numbers for imports, exports and trade
balance. Imports are expected to rise 6.0 percent on year after jumping
14.86 percent in February. Exports are called higher by an annual 11.74
percent after rising 8.56 percent in the previous month. The trade
surplus is pegged at $1.64 billion, down from $2,01 billion a month
earlier.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Thailand remain off until Friday for the
Songkran Festival.
