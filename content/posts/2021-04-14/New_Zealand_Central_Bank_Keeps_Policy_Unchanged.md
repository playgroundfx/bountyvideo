New Zealand's central bank left its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged on
Wednesday, as widely expected, and agreed to cut its interest rates
further if required as the economic outlook remains highly uncertain.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand decided
to keep the Official Cash Rate at 0.25 percent and the Large Scale Asset
Purchase at NZ$100 billion. The Funding for Lending programmes were also
kept unchanged.

The committee agreed to retain its current expansionary monetary setting
until consumer price inflation will be sustained at the 2 percent
target, and that employment is at or above its maximum sustainable
level.

The MPC said it is prepared to lower the benchmark rate if required.

The committee observed that short-term data continues to be highly
variable as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19.

Over the medium-term, the outlook remains highly uncertain, determined
in large part by both [health][1]-related restrictions, and
[business][2] and consumer confidence, the MPC said.

Although disruptions to global supply chains and higher oil prices are
leading to specific near-term price pressures, the medium-term inflation
and employment would likely remain below its target in the absence of
prolonged monetary stimulus.

"If the [economy][3] continues to improve as we anticipate, we suspect
the Bank may end its purchases altogether around the end of this year"
Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics, said. The economist expects
the central bank to raise rates towards the end of next year.
