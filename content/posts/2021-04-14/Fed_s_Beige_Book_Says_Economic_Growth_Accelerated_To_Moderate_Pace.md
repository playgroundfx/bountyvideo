Economic activity in the U.S. accelerated to a moderate pace from late
February to early April, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in each of the twelve Fed districts, highlighted improvement
in a variety of areas, including consumer spending, auto sales and
manufacturing activity.

The Fed also noted reports on tourism were more upbeat, bolstered by a
pickup in demand for leisure activities and travel.

Contacts attributed the increase in demand to spring break, an easing of
pandemic-related restrictions, increased vaccinations, and recent
stimulus payments, among other factors.

The report also said job growth picked up over the reporting period,
with most districts noting modest to moderate increases in employment.

The Fed said job growth was generally strongest in manufacturing,
construction, and leisure and hospitality, although hiring remained a
widespread challenge.

"Wage growth accelerated slightly overall, with more significant wage
pressures in industries like manufacturing and construction where
finding and retaining workers was particularly difficult," the Fed
added.

The Beige Book said overall prices also accelerated slightly since the
last report, with many districts reporting moderate price increases and
some saying prices rose more robustly.

Looking ahead, the Fed said outlooks were more optimistic than in the
previous report, boosted in part by an acceleration in COVID-19
vaccinations.

The release of the Beige Book comes two weeks ahead of the Federal
Reserve's next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, which is scheduled for April
27-28.
