Poland's industrial production grew less than expected in August, data
from Statistics Poland revealed Friday.

Another report showed that producer prices declined at a faster pace in
August due to lower cost in manufacturing.

Industrial production advanced 1.5 percent annually versus a 1.5 percent
fall in the same period last year. However, this was slower than the
expected growth of 2.8 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial output decreased 5.8 percent in August.

Manufacturing output rose 2 percent, while mining and quarrying output
was down 10.7 percent. Electricity output decreased 2.7 percent in
August.

Producer prices dropped 1.2 percent annually, following a 0.6 percent in
July, the statistical office said in a separate report. Economists had
forecast a 1 percent drop.

Prices in manufacturing slid 2.1 percent, while prices in mining and
quarrying grew 5.3 percent, and electricity and other utilities gained 2
percent. Water supply, sewerages and waste management prices advanced
5.9 percent.

Month-on-month, producer prices dropped 0.3 percent, offsetting a 0.3
percent rise in July.
