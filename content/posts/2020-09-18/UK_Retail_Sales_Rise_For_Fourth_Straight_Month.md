UK retail sales grew for the fourth straight month in August surpassing
the pre-pandemic level, data from the Office for National Statistics
showed Friday.

Retail sales volume increased 0.8 percent month-on-month in August, but
slower than July's 3.7 percent increase. This was the fourth consecutive
monthly rise. Sales were forecast to climb 0.7 percent.

When compared with February 2020's pre-pandemic level, total retail
sales were 4.0 percent higher in volume [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

Retail sales continued to grow, further surpassing their pre-pandemic
level," Jonathan Athow, deputy ONS national statistician for economic
statistics, said.

The strength of retail sales is particularly striking in a month when
non-retail spending, particularly on restaurant meals due to the Eat Out
to Help Out scheme, also picked up, Andrew Wishart, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

But spending may yet stutter as the furlough scheme is wound down and
unemployment rises, weighing on household incomes and job security, the
economist added.

Excluding automotive fuel, retail sales growth eased less-than-expected
to 0.6 percent in August from 2.1 percent in July. The rate was expected
to slow to 0.4 percent.

Online retail sales fell 2.5 percent in August when compared with July,
but the strong growth experienced over the pandemic has meant that sales
were still 46.8 percent higher than February's pre-pandemic levels.

Food store sales were up 0.4 percent from July. At the same time, non-
food store sales gained 3.4 percent in August driven by a 13.5 percent
surge in clothing and footwear sales and a 1.9 percent rise in household
goods store sales.

On a yearly basis, retail sales volume growth doubled to 2.8 percent
from 1.4 percent. However, this was weaker than economists' forecast of
3 percent.

Excluding auto fuel, retail sales volume advanced 4.3 percent annually
versus a 3.1 percent rise in July. Economists had forecast an annual
growth of 4.2 percent.
