Germany's producer prices declined at the slowest pace in five months in
August, preliminary data from the Federal Statistical Office showed on
Friday.

Producer prices declined 1.2 percent year-on-year following a 1.7
percent fall in July. Economists had expected a 1.4 percent decrease.

The pace of decline was the weakest since March, when prices fell 0.8
percent.

The main reason for the decline in commercial producer prices in August
was the 3.9 percent year-ob-year slump in energy prices.

Prices for petroleum products decreased 14.4 percent and those for
natural gas in distribution fell 9.9 percent.

Excluding energy, producer prices decreased 0.4 percent from the same
month of 2019.

Compared to the previous month, producer prices were unchanged in August
after a 0.2 percent increase in July. Economists had expected a 0.1
percent.
