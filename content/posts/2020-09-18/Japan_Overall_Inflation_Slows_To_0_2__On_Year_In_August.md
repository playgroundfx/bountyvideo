Overall nationwide consumer prices in Japan were up 0.2 percent on year
in August, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Friday - in line with expectations and slowing from 0.3 percent in July.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food costs, sank an annual 0.4 percent
- again matching forecasts following the flat reading in the previous
month.

Individually, prices were down for fuel, education and recreation -
while prices were higher for food, housing, furniture, clothing and
medical care.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall inflation slipped 0.1
percent and core CPI dropped 0.4 percent.
