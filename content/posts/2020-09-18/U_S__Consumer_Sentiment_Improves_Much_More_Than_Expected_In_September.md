After reporting an unexpected increase in U.S. consumer sentiment in the
previous month, the University of Michigan released a report on Friday
showing consumer sentiment continued to improve in the month of
September.

The preliminary report said the consumer sentiment index climbed to 78.9
in September from 74.1 in August. Economists had expected the index to
show a much more modest uptick to 75.0.

The index reached its highest level since March but is still well below
the pre-pandemic reading of 101.0 seen in February.

The much bigger than expected increase by the consumer sentiment index
reflected improvements in consumers' assessment of current conditions as
well as their outlook for the future.

The current economic conditions index jumped to 87.5 in September 82.9
in August, while the index of consumer expectations surged up to 73.3
from 68.5.

"Over the next several months, there are two factors that could cause
volatile shifts and steep losses in consumer confidence: how the
election is decided and the delays in obtaining vaccinations," said
Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin.

He added, "While the end of the recession will depend on these non-
economic factors, the hardships endured by consumers can only be offset
by renewed federal relief payments."

On the inflation front, the report said one-year inflations expectations
tumbled to 2.7 percent in September from 3.1 percent in August, while
five-year inflation expectations edged down to 2.6 percent from 2.7
percent.
