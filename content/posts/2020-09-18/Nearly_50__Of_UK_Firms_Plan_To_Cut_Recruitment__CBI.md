Nearly half of the UK firms plan to either reduce or not recruit at all
over the coming year, according to an annual survey conducted by the
Confederation of British Industry released Friday.

About 47 percent plan to maintain or increase recruitment, compared to
45 percent of respondents who expect to reduce recruitment or stop
hiring altogether.

Further, a balance of +7 percent of respondents expect that their
workforce will be larger in 12 months' time, compared to a balance of
+28 percent in last year's survey.

With ongoing social distancing, higher costs, lower demand, local
lockdowns and fears of a second wave, firms are tempering their
recruitment plans, Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) director, said.

Businesses are focusing on bolstering their efforts to protects jobs and
livelihoods, from cutting hours and reducing bonuses to restructuring,
he said. But continued cost pressure, unpredictable demand and
uncertainty around Brexit negotiations are making trading conditions
tough.

As the Job Retention Scheme unwinds, it's crucial another lifeline is
found, Fell noted.
