Reflecting a substantial rebound in prices for fuel imports, the Labor
Department released a report on Wednesday showing U.S. import prices
increased by much more than expected in the month of January.

The Labor Department said import prices surged up by 2.0 percent in
January after falling by a revised 0.4 percent in December.

Economists had expected import prices to jump by 1.0 percent compared to
the 0.2 percent dip originally reported for the previous month.

The report showed export prices also spiked by 2.9 percent in January
after tumbling by a revised 1.6 percent in December.

Export prices were expected to advance by 1.3 percent compared to the
1.8 percent slump originally reported for the previous month.
