Consumer prices in China were up 0.9 percent on year in January, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 1.0 percent and down
sharply from 1.5 percent in December.

On a monthly basis, inflation was up 0.4 percent - again missing
estimates for 0.5 percent following the 0.3 percent gain in the previous
month.
