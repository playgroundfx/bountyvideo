After reporting a modest decrease in U.S. industrial production in the
previous month, the Federal Reserve released a report on Wednesday
showing production rebounded by much more than anticipated in the month
of January.

The Fed said industrial production jumped by 1.4 percent in January
after edging down by 0.1 percent in December. Economists had expected
industrial production to rise by 0.4 percent.

The much bigger than expected rebound in industrial production was led
by a spike in utilities output, which skyrocketed by 9.9 percent in
January after tumbling by 1.8 percent in December.

Utilities output soared as the demand for heating surged amid the
arrival of significantly colder-than-normal temperatures.

The report showed mining output also increased by 1.0 percent in January
after jumping by 1.5 percent in December, while manufacturing output
crept up by 0.2 percent after dipping by 0.1 percent in the previous
month.

"Looking ahead, industrial production will have a solid year, but growth
won't be as strong as last year," said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S.
Economist at Oxford Economics. "The biggest question facing the
industrial sector is how quickly will supply chain and hiring headwinds
dissipate."

"We expect these challenges to diminish slowly as the [economy][1]
learns to live with Covid," he added. "However, even if the virus
disappeared overnight, it would take a while for supply chains to
completely heal."

The Fed also said capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose to
77.6 percent in January from an upwardly revised 76.6 percent in
December.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to inch up to 76.8 percent
from the 76.5 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the utilities sector surged to 78.1 percent,
while capacity utilization in the mining and manufacturing sectors edged
up to 79.1 percent and 77.3 percent, respectively.
