Eurozone industrial production growth halved in December, data released
by Eurostat showed on Wednesday.

Industrial output grew 1.2 percent on a monthly basis, following
November's 2.4 percent increase. Nonetheless, this was faster than the
economists' forecast of 0.5 percent.  
  
The slowdown was driven by the weakness in energy and durable consumer
goods production.  
  
Output of intermediate goods gained 0.5 percent and that of capital
goods by 2.6 percent. Non-durable consumer goods output moved up 0.4
percent.

Meanwhile, energy output and durable consumer goods output decreased 0.8
percent and 0.3 percent, respectively.

Year-on-year, industrial production was up 1.6 percent, in contrast to
the 1.4 percent decline in the previous month.  
  
Industrial production in the EU27 grew 0.7 percent on month, taking the
annual growth to 2.5 percent.
