Partly reflecting a spike in retail inventories, the Commerce Department
released a report on Wednesday showing another significant increase in
U.S. [business][1] inventories in the month of December.

The report said business inventories shot up by 2.1 percent in December
after surging by an upwardly revised 1.5 percent in November.

Economists had expected business inventories to jump by 2.1 percent
compared to the 1.3 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Retail inventories led the way higher, soaring by 4.2 percent, while
wholesale inventories leapt by 2.2 percent and manufacturing inventories
edged up by 0.3 percent.

"The sixth sequential month of accelerating inventory gains is an
encouraging sign that supply chains' worst snarls are behind us," said
Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

"We look for inventories to continue rising this year as businesses work
to fulfill backlogged orders and supply-side constraints very slowly
ease," he added. "The gradual rotation in consumer spending towards in-
person services at the expense of goods should also allow inventories to
grow more quickly."

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said business sales fell by 0.7
percent in December following a 1.1 percent jump in November.

The report showed a 2.8 percent slump in retail sales more than offset a
0.4 percent increase in manufacturing sales and a 0.2 percent uptick in
wholesale sales.

With inventories spiking and sales falling, the total business
inventories/sales ratio jumped to 1.29 in December from 1.25 in
November.
