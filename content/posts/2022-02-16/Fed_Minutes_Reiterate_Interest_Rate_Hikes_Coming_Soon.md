The Federal Reserve released the minutes of its January monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
meeting Wednesday afternoon, reiterating the view that it would "soon be
appropriate" to begin raising interest rates.

The belief that interest rate liftoff should begin soon comes as
participants noted that inflation continues to run well above 2 percent
and that the labor market has made substantial, broad-based progress
over the past year.

The minutes showed participants compared the current situation to the
last time the Fed began removing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation in 2015,
determining there is currently a much stronger outlook for growth in
economic activity, substantially higher inflation, and a notably tighter
labor market

Consequently, most participants suggested that a faster pace of rate
increases than in the post-2015 period would likely be warranted, the
Fed said.

"But that isn't saying much," said Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist
at Capital Economics, who noted a full 12 months elapsed between the
first rate hike in December 2015 and the second at the end of 2016.

Participants emphasized that the appropriate path would depend on
economic and financial developments and indicated they would be updating
their assessments at each meeting.

"Participants noted that the removal of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation in current
circumstances depended on the timing and pace of both increases in the
target range of the federal funds rate and the reduction in the size of
the Federal Reserve's balance sheet," the central bank said.

The Fed added, "In this context, a number of participants commented that
conditions would likely warrant beginning to reduce the size of the
balance sheet sometime later this year."

The minutes showed most participants agreed it would be appropriate to
remove [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation at a faster pace than currently anticipated
if inflation does not move down as expected.

Ashworth said this suggestion is "arguably a little more hawkish" but
added, "Still, nothing in the minutes suggests Jim Bullard's ultra-
hawkishness is shared by the majority on the FOMC."

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently indicated he supports
raising interest rates by a full percentage point by the start of July
and told CNBC he favors front-loading planned interest rate increases

While some participants warned financial conditions might tighten unduly
in response to a rapid removal of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation, a few said the
risk could be mitigated through clear and effective communication by the
Fed.

The minutes also showed most participants preferred ending the central
bank's asset purchases by early March as planned, although a couple
favored ending the purchases sooner to "send an even stronger signal
that the Committee was committed to bringing down inflation."

The Fed's next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting is scheduled for March 15-16,
with CME Group's FedWatch tool currently indicating a 55.7 percent
chance of a 25 basis point rate increase and a 44.3 percent chance of a
50 basis point rate hike.
