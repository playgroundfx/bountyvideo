UK retail sales increased in August driven by internet spending, reports
said citing a monthly report from the British Retail Consortium on
Tuesday.

Total retail sales advanced 3.9 percent on yearly basis in August.
Online food sales surged 42.4 percent, while in-store sales of non-food
products declined 17.8 percent.

Like-for-like sales grew 4.7 percent on year versus a 0.8 percent fall
in August.

Remote working has continued to help sales in goods, such as food,
computing, furniture and TVs, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the
British Retail Consortium, said.

Lockdown also appears to have permanently changed some consumers'
shopping habits, with online sales continuing to boom despite shops
reopening in June, she noted.

Meanwhile, city centre retailers continue to be devastated by low
footfall and poor sales, as office workers stayed away for yet another
month, Dickinson added.
