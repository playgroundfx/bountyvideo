A measure of the public assessment of the Japanese [economy][1] rose for
the fourth month in a row in August, survey data from the Cabinet Office
showed on Tuesday.

The current conditions index of the Economy Watchers' Survey, which
measures the current [business][2] morale from the view of workers
including hairdressers, taxi drivers and waiters, increased to 43.9 in
August from 41.1 in July.

A reading below 50 suggests pessimism.

The outlook index that signals future activity rose to 42.4 in August
from 36.0 in the previous month. In June, the outlook index was at 44.0.
