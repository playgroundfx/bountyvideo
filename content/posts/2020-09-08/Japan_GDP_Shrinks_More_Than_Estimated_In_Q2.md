Japan's [economy][1] contracted more than initially estimated in the
second quarter, largely due to a sharp downward revision in capital
investment, second estimates from the Cabinet Office showed Tuesday.

Due to the restrictions imposed to contain the [coronavirus][2] spread,
gross domestic product shrank by a record 7.9 percent sequentially
instead of the 7.8 percent fall estimated initially.

On an annualized basis, GDP plunged 28.1 percent in the second quarter
compared to the 27.8 percent decline estimated on August 17.  
  
The quarterly decline in capital investment was revised to 4.7 percent
from 1.5 percent in the second quarter. Government consumption decreased
0.6 percent, which was more severe than the prior estimate of a 0.3
percent fall.

Meanwhile, private consumption dropped 7.9 percent, which was slower
than the 8.2 percent decrease estimated previously. The declines in
exports and imports were confirmed at 18.5 percent and 0.5 percent,
respectively.

Separate data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
showed household spending declined 7.6 percent on a yearly basis in
July. At the same time, household income advanced 9.2 percent from last
year.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, labor cash
earnings declined for the fourth straight month in July. Average cash
earnings fell 1.3 percent after easing 2 percent in June.

Overtime pay declined sharply by 16.6 percent, while scheduled wages
gained 0.3 percent in July.

Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics, said wage growth
improved in July and household incomes are likely to rebound further as
more workers who lost their jobs during the state of emergency find
employment again.

However, with far fewer workers on furlough and employment now starting
to gradually recover, the big hit to household incomes is probably
behind us, the economist noted.

Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan reported that bank lending growth improved
to 6.7 percent in August from 6.4 percent in July. Lending by major
banks climbed 8 percent and that by Shinkin banks grew 7.3 percent.

The current surplus fell 27.4 percent to JPY 1.47 trillion in July
largely due to fall in primary income, the Finance Ministry reported
Tuesday.
