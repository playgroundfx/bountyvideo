Lithuania consumer price inflation rose in August, figures from the
statistical office showed on Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 1.3 percent year-on-year in August,
following a 1.0 percent increase in July and June.

Cost of education showed the biggest annual growth of 8.5 percent in
August and those for [health][1] care gained 8.0 percent.

Prices for hotels, cafes and restaurants increased by 4.8 percent and
those of furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance of the
house rose 3.7 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in August,
following a 0.3 percent decline in the previous month.

This was mainly due to decline in prices of clothing and footwear.
