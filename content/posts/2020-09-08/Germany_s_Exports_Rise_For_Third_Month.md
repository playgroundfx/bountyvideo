Germany's exports expanded for the third straight month in July but the
rate of growth moderated more-than-expected, data from Destatis revealed
Tuesday.

Exports climbed 4.7 percent on month in July, slower than the 14.9
percent increase in June. This was also weaker than the expected 5
percent increase.

Similarly, the increase in imports eased to 1.1 percent from 7 percent a
month ago. Economists had forecast a 3.3 percent rise.

As a result, the trade surplus rose to a seasonally adjusted EUR 18
billion from EUR 14.5 billion a month ago. The surplus was expected to
climb to EUR 16 billion.

On a yearly basis, exports were down 11 percent versus June's 9.4
percent decrease. Likewise, imports slid 11.3 percent after falling 10
percent.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus advanced to EUR 19.2 billion
in July from EUR 21.3 billion in the previous year.

"While today's numbers are good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for our call of surging GDP growth
in the second quarter and suggest that the export sector is flourishing
again, we should not get carried away by these numbers," Carsten
Brzeski, an ING economist, said.

They are still part of the mechanical rebound. In fact, the German
export sector is still suffering from structural challenges including
trade tensions, Brexit and global supply chain disruptions as well as
difficulties among its main trading partners to cope with the virus, the
economist noted.  
Exports to China decreased by just 0.1 percent annually, while shipments
to the United States, which have been hit particularly hard by the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, dropped by 17 percent. Exports to the United
Kingdom showed a decrease of 12.6 percent.  
Imports from China grew 7.4 percent, while that from the US declined
14.8 percent. Imports from the UK decreased 24.8 percent.  
The current account surplus totaled EUR 20 billion compared to EUR 19.4
billion in the same period last year.  
Compared with February, the month before restrictions were imposed due
to the corona pandemic, exports decreased 12.1 percent, and imports by
11.5 percent.  
Another report from Destatis showed that labor cost grew 1.9 percent
sequentially taking the annual growth to 5.1 percent in the second
quarter.  
The labor cost index increased by a total of 4.3 percent on the fourth
quarter of 2019, that was the quarter before restrictions were imposed
due to the coronavirus pandemic in Germany.
