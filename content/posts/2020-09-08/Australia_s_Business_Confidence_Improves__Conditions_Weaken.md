Australia's [business][1] confidence improved in August, while business
conditions weakened from the previous month, survey data from the
National Australia Bank showed Tuesday.

The business confidence index rose to -8 from -14 in July. Although
confidence rose in the month, it remained very weak and likely fragile.

Confidence was negative in all industries despite improvements outside
of mining and recreational and personal in the month. Confidence was the
weakest in mining and least worst in finance, business and property.

Meanwhile, the business conditions indicator fell to -6 in August from
zero a month ago. The decline in conditions was driven by a sharp -11
points fall in the employment index. Trading was down 3 points and
profitably dropped 4 points from the previous month.

Among leading indicators, forward orders weakened and capacity
utilization edged lower and alongside the weak level of confidence,
suggest that conditions may deteriorate further.

The survey showed that the impact of the Melbourne stage 4 restrictions
on activity was evident in Victoria with a decline in conditions, though
not as bad as feared. Encouragingly, confidence in Victoria improved,
likely reflecting an improvement in case numbers.
