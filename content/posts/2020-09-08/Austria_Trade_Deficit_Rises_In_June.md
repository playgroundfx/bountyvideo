Austria's trade deficit increased in June from last year amid a fall
exports and imports, data from the Statistics Austria showed on Tuesday.

The trade deficit rose to EUR 116.193 million in June from EUR 94.194
million in the same month last year.

Exports fell 5.4 percent year-on-year in June and imports declined 5.1

"Foreign trade is showing signs of recovery for the first time,"
Statistics Austria General Manager Tobias Thomas said.

"Declines are still clear, but at around 5 percent they are weaker than
in the Corona months from March to May 2020," Thomas added.

The trade with EU nations resulted in a deficit of EUR 219.855 million
in June from EUR 285.435 million in the same month last year.
