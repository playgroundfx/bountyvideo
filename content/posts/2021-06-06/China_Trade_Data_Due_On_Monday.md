China will on Monday release May figures for imports, exports and trade
balance, headlining a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

Imports are expected to skyrocket 51.5 percent on year after jumping
43.1 percent in April. Exports are called higher by an annual 32.1
percent after rising 32.3 percent in the previous month. The trade
surplus is pegged at $50.5 billion, up from $42.85 billion a month
earlier.

Australia will see May results for the Performance of Services Index
from the Australian Industry Group and for job ads from ANZ. In April,
the services index score was 61.0, while job ads jumped 4.7 percent on
month.

Japan will see preliminary April figures for its leading and coincident
economic indexes; in March, their scores were 102.5 and 93.0,
respectively.

Finally, the [markets][1] in New Zealand (queen's birthday) and Malaysia
(Yang Dipertuan Agong's birthday) are closed on Monday and will re-open
on Tuesday.
