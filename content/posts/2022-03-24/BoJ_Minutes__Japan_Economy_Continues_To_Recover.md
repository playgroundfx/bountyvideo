Members of the Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Board said that Japan's
economic recovery is continuing at a satisfactory pace in the wake of
the COVID-19 pandemic, minutes from the bank's January 17-18 meeting
revealed on Thursday.

Corporate profits and [business][1] sentiment continue to improve, the
minutes showed, although employment and income remain weak.

To that end, the board said it finds it appropriate to maintain its
current monetary easing and support stability in the financial
[markets][2].

At the meeting, the BoJ voted 8-1 to maintain its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stimulus unchanged at -0.1 percent on current accounts that financial
institutions maintain at the central bank. It also lifted its inflation
forecast for the next fiscal year, citing a rise in commodity prices.

The bank also said it will continue to purchase a necessary amount of
Japanese government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year
JGB yields will remain at around zero percent.
