The Philippine central bank decided to maintain its key interest rate at
a record low, as widely expected, on Thursday.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas left the key
interest rate, which is the overnight reverse repurchase facility rate,
steady at 2.00 percent.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
also kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.

Citing higher global commodity prices, the bank had raised its inflation
forecast for 2022 to 4.3 percent from 3.7 percent. Nevertheless, average
inflation is projected to decline and settle within the target band at
3.6 percent in 2023, the bank said.  
  
The bank observed that domestic economic activity gained stronger
traction with the easing of remaining mobility restrictions. However,
heightened geopolitical tensions and the resurgence in COVID-19
infections in some countries clouded the outlook for global economic
growth.

Supply-chain disruptions could also contribute to inflationary
pressures, and thus warrant closer monitoring to enable timely
intervention in order to arrest potential second-round effects, the bank
noted.

The BSP will be in little hurry to tighten [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the months ahead,
as supporting the economic recovery takes precedence over combating
inflation, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Inflation is expected to peak at 5 percent in the second quarter, Alex
added. But this should prove temporary and it is likely to drop back to
within the central bank's 2-4 percent target range by the end of the
year.
