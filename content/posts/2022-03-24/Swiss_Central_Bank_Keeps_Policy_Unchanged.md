The Swiss National Bank left its expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged
on Thursday.

Policymakers of the central bank decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and
interest on sight deposits at the SNB at -0.75 percent.

The bank repeated that it is willing to intervene in the foreign
exchange market as necessary, in order to counter upward pressure on the
Swiss franc. The Swiss franc remains highly valued, the bank said.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to a strong increase in uncertainty
worldwide. Against this backdrop, the SNB with its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
ensuring price stability and supporting the Swiss [economy][1], the bank
added.

The bank upgraded its inflation outlook for this year due to the
significant increase in prices for oil products. Inflation is forecast
to rise to 2.1 percent this year instead of 1.0 percent projected in
December. For 2023 and 2024, inflation is seen at 0.9 percent.

The SNB noted that the war in Ukraine has had an effect on the Swiss
economy above all via the strong increase in commodity prices. The
central bank anticipated GDP growth of around 2.5 percent, this being
lower than its previous forecast.

It is difficult to assess the future course of the war and its economic
impact. The risks to growth are considerable and to the downside, said
SNB.
