With orders for transportation equipment pulling back sharply, the
Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing new orders for
U.S. manufactured durable goods tumbled by much more than expected in
the month of February.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders slumped by 2.2 percent
in February after jumping by 1.6 percent in January. Economists had
expected durable goods orders to dip by 0.5 percent.

The much bigger than expected decrease in durable goods orders came as
orders for transportation equipment plunged by 5.6 percent in February
after surging by 3.2 percent in January.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts led the way lower, plummeting
by 30.4 percent in February after soaring by 10.9 percent in January.

Excluding the steep drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders fell by 0.6 percent in February after climbing by 0.8
percent in January. The decrease surprised economists, who had expected
ex-transportation orders to rise by 0.6 percent.

The unexpected drop in ex-transportation orders reflected notable
declines in orders for machinery, computer and electronic products and
primary metals.

The report also showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a key indicator of [business][1] spending, dipped by 0.3
percent in February after jumping by 1.3 percent in January.

Meanwhile, shipments in the same category, which is the source data for
equipment investment in GDP, rose by 0.5 percent in February after
spiking by 2.1 percent in the previous month.

"We expect durable goods activity to regain their footing in the months
ahead, owing to a still-solid domestic backdrop," said Oren Klachkin,
Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics. "Businesses may be more
vigilant as recent events exacerbate logistics constraints and add
upward pressure to prices, but they're unlikely to pull back
significantly on investment.

"The overarching backdrop of healthy domestic demand backdrop will keep
U.S. businesses spending," he added. "In fact, greater supply chain
strains will force U.S. businesses to operate more adeptly and may
encourage more investment."
