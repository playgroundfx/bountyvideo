France private sector expanded at the fastest pace in eight months in
March despite the manufacturing slowdown, survey data from S&P Global
showed on Thursday.  
  
The flash composite output index unexpectedly rose to an eight-month
high of 56.2 in March from 55.5 in February. The score was forecast to
fall to 54.3.

The improved picture at the composite level failed to highlight the wide
sectoral differences. Services output grew at the fastest pace in four
months. Meanwhile, manufacturing production growth slowed notably due to
ongoing supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 57.4 from 55.5 a
month ago. The expected score was 55.0.

On the other hand, the manufacturing PMI declined to a five-month low of
54.8 from 57.2 in February. The reading was also below the economists'
forecast of 55.0.

The increased level of hesitancy being reported due to the war in
Ukraine, means risks to the economic outlook tilt further to the
downside, Joe Hayes, a senior economist at S&P Global said. At a time
when inflationary risks are building, the [economy][1] could therefore
be on course for a period of stagflation.
