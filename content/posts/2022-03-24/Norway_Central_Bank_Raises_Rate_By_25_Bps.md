Norway's central bank hiked its key rate by a quarter point, as
expected, and signaled another hike in June.

At the first rate decision by Ida Wolden Bache as the governor of Norges
Bank, the committee unanimously decided to lift its key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate to
0.75 percent from 0.50 percent.

"Based on the Committee's current assessment of the outlook and balance
of risks, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised further in June",
said Governor Ida Wolden Bache.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee observed that the
war in Ukraine has led to heightened uncertainty about the economic
outlook, but there are still prospects for a continued upswing in the
Norwegian [economy][1].

The committee assessed that the objective of stabilizing inflation
around the target somewhat further out suggests a higher [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate.

Uncertainties relating to the economic outlook and households' response
to higher interest rates warrant a gradual rise in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate.

If there are prospects of persistently high inflation, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate
may be raised more quickly, the governor said.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate forecast is higher than in the December Report and
indicated a rise in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate to around 2.5 percent at the end of
2023.

David Oxley, an economist at Capital Economics, said "We have pencilled
in two additional rate hikes next year, in line with the Bank's view."
But if anything, there is a good chance that it will front-load the
tightening.

The committee today raised the countercyclical capital buffer rate to
2.5 percent, with effect from March 31, 2023.

The buffer rate was raised to 1.5 percent in June 2021 and to 2 percent
in December 2021, effective from June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022,
respectively.
