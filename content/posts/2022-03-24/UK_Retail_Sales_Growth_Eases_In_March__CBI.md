The UK retail sales grew at a slower pace in March, according to the
Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation of British Industry,
released Thursday.

The retail sales balance fell to 9 percent in March from 14 percent in
February. However, a net 39 percent expects sales to rise in the year to
April.

A net 23 percent said retail sales were seen as poor for the time of the
year in March compared to +16 percent in February.

The internet sales volumes in the year to March fell at the sharpest
rate since the question was first asked in August 2009. The
corresponding balance plunged to -46 percent.

"Retailers had a mediocre March, with sales reported as being below
seasonal norms," Martin Sartorius, Principal Economist at the CBI, said.
The cost-of-living crisis is looming large across the sector, as
households' wallets are being hit by the fastest rate of inflation in
decades.
