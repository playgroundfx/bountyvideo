New Zealand manufacturing sector expanded for the first time since
February, survey data from the BusinessNZ showed Friday.

The Performance of Manufacturing Index rose to 56.3 in June from 39.8 in
May. This was the highest since April 2018.

Any reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

"A return to expansion for the sector was obviously a welcome result
given the very difficult period experienced over the last three months,"
BusinessNZ's Executive Director Catherine Beard, said.

Production and new orders expanded at the fastest pace since April 2018.
Expansion in the new orders over the coming month would ensure the
second half to be better than the first, Beard said.

"New Zealand's PMI average through April and May was at the bottom when
looking across usual comparator countries," BNZ Senior Economist, Doug
Steel said.

"But with the country at alert level 1, activity has picked up. Long may
it continue," Steel added.
