Reflecting the widespread resurgence of the [coronavirus][1], the
University of Michigan released a report on Friday showing an unexpected
deterioration in U.S. consumer sentiment in the month of July.

The preliminary report said the consumer sentiment index tumbled to 73.2
in July after jumping to 78.1 in June. The pullback surprised
economists, who had expected the index to inch up to 79.0.

With the unexpected decrease, Surveys of Consumers chief economist
Richard Curtin noted the index is "insignificantly" above the nearly
nine-year low set in April.

"Following the steepest two-month decline on record, it is not
surprising that consumers need some time to reassess the likely economic
impact from the coronavirus on their personal finances and on the
overall [economy][2]," Curtin said.

He added, "Unfortunately, declines are more likely in the months ahead
as the coronavirus spreads and causes continued economic harm, social
disruptions, and permanent scarring."

The unexpected drop by the headline index partly reflected concerns
about the economic outlook, as the index of consumer expectations
slumped to 66.2 in July from 72.3 in June.

The current economic conditions index also showed a notable decrease,
slid to 84.2 in July from 87.1 in June.

Meanwhile, the report said one-year inflation expectations inched up to
3.1 percent in July from 3.0 percent in June and five-year inflation
expectations rose to 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent.
