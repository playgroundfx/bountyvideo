German economic confidence weakened for the fourth consecutive month in
September as the global chip shortage as well as short supply of
construction materials weighed on profit expectations, survey results
from the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research showed
Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany fell more-than-
expected to 26.5 in September from 40.4 in August. The expected level
was 30.0.

The current reading suggests that over the next six months economic
growth will only slightly be higher than its current rate, the institute
said.

On the other hand, the current situation index improved by 2.6 points to
31.9 in September. The situation indicator has continuously increased
since February 2021. Nonetheless, the reading was below the economists'
forecast of 34.0.

Although financial market experts expect further improvements of the
economic situation over the next six months, the expected magnitude and
the dynamics of the improvements have decreased considerably, ZEW
President Achim Wambach said.

Wambach added that global chip shortage in the automobile sector and
shortage of building material in the construction sector have caused a
significant reduction in profit expectations for these sectors. This may
have had a negative effect on economic expectations.

Further, the survey showed that economic confidence in the euro area
also weakened for the fourth consecutive month in September. The
corresponding index declined 11.6 points to 31.1.

By contrast, the indicator for the current economic situation climbed
7.9 points to a level of 22.5 points in September.

Inflation expectations continued their decline. The inflation indicator
for the euro area plunged by 22.1 points to 20.1 in September. The
experts therefore expect inflation to decline over the next six months.
