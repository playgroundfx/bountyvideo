Japan will on Wednesday release final Q2 figures for gross domestic
product, highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

GDP is expected to add 0.4 percent on quarter and 1.6 percent on year
after falling 0.9 percent on quarter and 3.7 percent on year in the
three months prior.

Japan also will see July figures for current account and August numbers
for bank lending and the eco watchers survey. The current account is
expected to show a surplus of 2.30 trillion yen, up from 905.1 billion
yen in June. Overall bank lending in July was up 1.0 percent on year.
The eco survey for current conditions in July had a score of 48.4, with
an outlook of 47.7.

Indonesia will see August results for its consumer confidence index; in
July, the index score was 80.2.
