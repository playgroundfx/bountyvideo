Despite supply chain problems, Germany's industrial output grew for the
first time in four months in July, underpinned by higher production of
capital and consumer goods, Destatis said Tuesday.

Industrial production grew 1 percent month-on-month in July, offsetting
a revised 1 percent fall in June. Economists had forecast a monthly
growth of 0.9 percent.

The [economy][1] ministry said the outlook for the industrial economy as
a whole remains positive in the view of continued high demand and
production.

The monthly increase is unlikely to mark the end of the recent downward
trend in industrial production, Ralph Solveen, a senior economist at
Commerzbank, said. Rather, the timing of the factory holidays is more
likely to have played a role.

There will be no sustained turnaround in production until the
bottlenecks in intermediate products have been overcome, the economist
noted.

Compared with February 2020, the month before restrictions were imposed
due to the corona pandemic, production in this July was 5.5 percent
lower in seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), data showed.

Industrial production excluding energy and construction was up 1.3
percent in July.  
Within industry, output of capital goods showed an increase of 3.2
percent and that of consumer goods of 0.9 percent. Meanwhile,
intermediate goods output dropped 0.5 percent.

Outside industry, energy production slid 3.2 percent, while construction
output grew 1.1 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial output advanced 5.7 percent in July,
faster than the 5.4 percent increase posted in June.

Data released on Monday showed that factory orders expanded 3.4 percent
on a monthly basis in July after 4.6 percent expansion in June.
