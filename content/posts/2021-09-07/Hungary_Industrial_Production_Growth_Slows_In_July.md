Hungary's industrial production grew at a softer pace in July, data from
the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Tuesday.

Industrial production grew a working-day adjusted 10.2 percent year-on-
year in July, after a 18.6 percent rise in June.

The industrial production volume increased 8.0 percent yearly in July.
Economists had expected a 10.6 percent rise.

All manufacturing subsections contributed to the growth in July. The
largest contribution came from manufacture of transport equipment,
mainly due to factory shutdowns and one-shift work schedule.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production fell 0.5 percent
in July, following 0.3 percent decline in the preceding month.
