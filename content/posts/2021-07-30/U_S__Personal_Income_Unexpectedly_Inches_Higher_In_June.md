Personal income in the U.S. expectedly saw a slight increase in the
month of June, according to a report released by the Commerce Department
on Friday.

The report showed personal income inched up by 0.1 percent in June after
tumbling by a revised 2.2 percent in May.

The uptick surprised economists, who had expected personal income to dip
by 0.3 percent compared to the 2.0 percent slump originally reported for
the previous month.

The modest increase in personal income primarily reflected higher
private wages and salaries, which were partly offset by decreases in
economic impact payments and unemployment insurance.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, was virtually unchanged in June after plunging by 2.7 percent in
May.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said personal spending jumped by 1.0
percent in June after edging down by a revised 0.1 percent in May.

Economists had expected personal spending to increase by 0.7 percent
compared to the unchanged reading originally reported for the previous
month.

Excluding price changes, personal spending rose by a more modest 0.5
percent in June after falling by 0.6 percent in May.

Reflecting the rebound in personal spending, personal saving as a
percentage of disposable personal income slid to 9.4 percent in June
from 10.3 percent in May.

"That lower saving rate leaves less scope for households to fund further
consumption growth in the second half of the year," said Paul Ashworth,
Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "Overall, we now expect third-quarter real consumption growth
to be around 3% annualized, with GDP growth at 4%."

A reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal Reserve
showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth crept up to 3.5
percent in June from 3.4 percent in May.
