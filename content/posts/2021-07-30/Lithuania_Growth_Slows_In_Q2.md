Lithuania's economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter, after
a strong rebound in the previous three months as economic activity began
to gradually recover from the impact of the pandemic, preliminary
estimates from the statistical office showed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew a seasonally and working-day adjusted 0.4
percent from the first quarter, when the [economy][1] expanded 2.2
percent. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the economy shrank 0.3 percent.

The pace of growth was the weakest since the third quarter of 2018.

On a year-on-year basis, GDP increased an adjusted 8.6 percent in the
second quarter after a 1.4 percent gain in the previous three months.

In the first half of the year, GDP grew an adjusted 4.8 percent from the
same period last year.

On an unadjusted basis, GDP rose 5.7 percent quarterly after a 7.9
percent fall in the previous quarter. Compared to the same quarter last
year, economic output grew 6.9 percent following a 1.5 percent gain in
the previous three months.

In the first half of the year, GDP rose an unadjusted 4.2 percent from a
year ago.
