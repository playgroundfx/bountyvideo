The French [economy][1] rebounded at a faster-than-expected pace in the
second quarter, underpinned by household spending and investment, flash
data from the statistical office Insee revealed on Friday.

Gross domestic product rebounded 0.9 percent in the second quarter,
after being flat in the first quarter. Economists had forecast a
quarterly growth of 0.8 percent.

In the second quarter, GDP was 3.3 percent below the level of the fourth
quarter of 2019, as compared to 4.2 percent in the two previous
quarters, the statistical office said.

The expenditure-side breakdown of GDP showed that gross fixed capital
formation growth accelerated to 1.1 percent from 0.4 percent. Household
consumption expenditure gained 0.9 percent after rising 0.2 percent a
quarter ago.

Imports climbed 1.9 percent sequentially and exports advanced 1.5
percent. As a result, foreign trade made a slightly negative
contribution to GDP growth by -0.1 points, after -0.5 points in the
previous quarter.

Lastly, the contribution of inventory changes to the growth of the GDP
was slightly positive this quarter, at 0.2 points.

Another report from the statistical office showed that household
spending grew 0.3 percent in June after a sharp growth of 10.6 percent
in May. This was also weaker than the economists' forecast of 1.4
percent.

The increase in purchases of manufactured goods by 2.7 percent was
offset by 1.6 percent declines in both food consumption and energy
expenditure.
