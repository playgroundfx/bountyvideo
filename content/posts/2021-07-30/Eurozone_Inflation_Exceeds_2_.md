Eurozone inflation accelerated more-than-expected in July, largely
driven by higher energy prices, flash data from Eurostat showed on
Friday.

Inflation rose to 2.2 percent in July from 1.9 percent in June. The rate
was above the expected 2 percent.

Meanwhile, core inflation that excludes energy, food, alcohol and
tobacco, slowed to 0.7 percent in July from 0.9 percent in June. The
rate was forecast to ease to 0.8 percent.

On July 8, the European Central Bank adopted a symmetric 2 percent
inflation target that will allow a temporary overshoot in inflation.

On a monthly basis, the harmonized index of consumer prices was down 0.1
percent.  
  
Among main components of inflation, energy logged its highest annual
rate in July, up 14.1 percent. Prices of food, alcohol and tobacco
advanced 1.6 percent annually.

Non-energy industrial goods prices rose 0.7 percent and services costs
advanced 0.9 percent in July.
