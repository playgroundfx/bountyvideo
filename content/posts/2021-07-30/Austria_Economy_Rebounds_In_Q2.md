Austria's [economy][1] rebounded strongly in the second quarter to exit
a recession, preliminary estimates from the economic institute WIFO
showed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 4.3 percent from the first quarter when the
economy shrank 1.1 percent. Economists had forecast 3.5 percent growth.
In the final three months of 2020, GDP decreased 3.1 percent.

Year-on-year, GDP rose 11.4 percent in the second quarter after a 4.5
percent slump in the previous three months.

Consumer demand and activity in the consumption-relevant service sectors
increased as measures to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic
were relaxed.

Private consumption increased 3.8 percent quarterly after falling in
each of the previous two quarters. Investments continued to grow, up 2.1
percent in the second quarter.

Exports and imports rebounded with growths of 14.9 percent and 9.8
percent, respectively.

The industrial economy continued to recover in the second quarter, while
construction shrank.
