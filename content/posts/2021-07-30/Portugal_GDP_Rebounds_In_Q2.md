Portugal's [economy][1] expanded in the second quarter after contracting
in the previous three months, as activity began to gradually recover
after a lockdown to curb the a fresh wave of the coronavirus pandemic.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 4.9 percent from the first quarter, when it
shrunk 3.2 percent, preliminary estimates from Statistics Portugal
showed Friday.  
  
"There was a general confinement due to the worsening of the pandemic,
followed by a plan to gradually reopen the economy as of mid-March," the
statistical office said.  
  
Quarterly growth was largely driven by the positive contribution of
domestic demand and a less negative contribution of net external demand.  
  
Year-on-year, GDP rose 15.5 percent in the second quarter after a 5.3
percent fall in the previous quarter. The increase was the first since
the fourth quarter of 2019.  
  
"This evolution is influenced by a base effect, as the restrictions
imposed on economic activity as a result of the pandemic were felt more
intensely in the first two months of the second quarter of 2020, leading
to unprecedented contraction of economic activity," Statistics Portugal
said.
