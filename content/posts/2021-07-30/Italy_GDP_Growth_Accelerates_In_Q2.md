Italy's [economy][1] expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter,
the preliminary estimate from the statistical office Istat showed on
Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 2.7 percent sequentially in the second
quarter, much faster than the 0.2 percent expansion posted in the first
quarter. Economists had forecast a moderate 1.3 percent growth.

Year-on-year, growth came in at a double-digit 17.3 percent, in contrast
to a 0.7 percent fall seen in the first quarter. Economists had expected
15.6 percent growth for the second quarter.

From the demand side, there is a positive contribution to quarterly
growth from both the domestic component, namely gross of change in
inventories and the net export component.

The carry-over annual GDP growth for 2021 was equal to 4.8 percent.
