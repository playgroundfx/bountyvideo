France consumer price inflation slowed in July driven by the downturn in
manufactured goods prices and the slowdown in services price growth,
provisional data from the statistical office Insee showed on Friday.

Consumer price inflation slowed to 1.2 percent in July from 1.5 percent
in the previous month. But this was above economists' forecast of 1
percent.

Similarly, harmonized inflation eased to 1.6 percent from 1.9 percent in
June. The expected rate was 1.4 percent.

Manufactured product prices dropped 1.1 percent, while food prices
gained 0.8 percent. Services prices grew at a slower pace of 0.7
percent. Meanwhile, energy price inflation rose to 12.4 percent from
10.9 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent, the same as in
June. Prices were forecast to fall 0.1 percent.

The harmonized index of consumer prices grew 0.1 percent, slower than
the 0.2 percent rise a month ago. Economists had forecast a monthly fall
of 0.1 percent.
