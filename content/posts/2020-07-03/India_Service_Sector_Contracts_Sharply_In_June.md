India's service sector contracted at a sharper pace due to the economic
disruption caused by Covid-19 pandemic, survey results from IHS Markit
showed on Friday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 33.7 in June from 12.6
in May. The reading has remained below 50 neutral mark for the fourth
straight month.

New orders declined at a sharper pace in June and customers closed their
[business][1] due to the unfavorable environment. Export sales declined
steeply in June.

Companies became more pessimistic towards their prospects for the coming
twelve months and business confidence fell to a survey low.

Employment declined in June due to lower business requirements.
Outstanding contracts rose in June due to the capacity pressure.

Input cost decreased for the third straight month in June and running
costs were down due to lower activity. Lower expenses were passed
through to clients via discounts in June.

The composite index rose to 37.8 in June from 14.8 in the previous
month.

"India's service sector continued to struggle in June as the country's
[coronavirus][2] crisis worsened," Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS
Markit, said.

"Simply put, the country is gripped in an unprecedented economic
downturn which is certainly going to spill over into the second half of
this year unless the infection rate can be brought under control," Hayes
added.
