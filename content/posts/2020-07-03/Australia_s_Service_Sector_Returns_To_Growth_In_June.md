Australia's service sector grew for the first time in five months in
June amid a further easing of Covid-19 restrictions, survey data from
IHS Markit showed Friday.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia services Purchasing Managers' Index
surged to 53.1 in June from 26.9 in May. The flash reading was 53.2.

A score above 50 indicates expansion. Moreover, the latest expansion was
the fastest for just over one-and-a-half years.

The lifting of restrictions provided relief to the service sector as
firms reopened and individuals resumed consumption. This led to a marked
improvement in demand conditions.

However, despite increased capacity pressure, firms continued to reduce
staff numbers in June.

Input costs advanced notably after two months of declines, with
inflation linked to greater staff costs, increased fuel prices and
supplier price hikes. Consequently, firms raised their selling prices
for the first time in three months.

Finally, [business][1] expectations for the year-ahead outlook improved
further in June, with sentiment rising to the highest in nine months.

The composite output index, which is designed to provide a timely
indication of changes in business activity in the private sector
[economy][2], improved to 52.7 in June from 28.1 a month ago.

The score was slightly above the flash estimate of 52.6.

The overall upturn in the private sector was led by a similarly
substantial increase in services business activity.
