Australia's retail sales increased more than estimated in May, final
data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.

Retail sales grew 16.9 percent month-on-month in May, after a 17.7
percent drop in April. Retail sales for May was revised up from 16.3
percent.

"The gradual easing of social distancing [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, and the re-opening
of physical stores, bolstered retail trade in May," said Ben James,
Director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys, said.

Sale of clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing accelerated
129.2 percent monthly in May and cafes, restaurants and takeaway food
services gained 30.3 percent.

Food retailing rose 7.2 percent and other retailing increased 9.4
percent. Housing goods sales grew 16.6 percent and department stores
sales jumped 44.4 percent.
