China's service sector expanded at the fastest pace in more than a
decade in June, driven by strong orders as measures related to the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic were relaxed, survey data from IHS Markit
showed Friday.

The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 58.4 in June from
55.0 in May. The rate of expansion was the fastest since April 2010. A
score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Total new orders advanced at the quickest pace since August 2010 driven
by improving market conditions and new export work expanded for the
first time since January.

Firms widely reported that overall market conditions had continued to
improve following an easing of measures related to the coronavirus
disease 2019 pandemic.

Nonetheless, service providers reported another fall in workforce
numbers. As new [business][2] increased, outstanding workloads logged a
renewed rise in June.  
  
On the price front, the survey showed a slight drop in input prices at
the end of the second quarter. At the same time, prices charged by
services companies were broadly unchanged in June, thereby ending a six-
month period of decline.

Service providers expressed stronger optimism towards the 12-month
outlook for business activity in June.

The composite output index rose to 55.7 in June from 54.5 in May, to
signal a sharp and accelerated increase in overall Chinese business
activity.

"Although businesses were optimistic about the economic outlook, they
remained cautious about increasing hiring, with employment in both the
manufacturing and services sectors shrinking," Wang Zhe, a senior
economist at Caixin Insight Group said.  
  
Addressing the employment problem requires not only macro policies to
further promote work resumption, but also more targeted relief measures
introduced by governments to tide companies over, said Wang.
