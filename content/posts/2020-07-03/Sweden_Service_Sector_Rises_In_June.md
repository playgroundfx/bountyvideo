Sweden's services sector improved in June, survey data from Swedbank and
the logistics association SILF showed on Friday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector increased to 49.2
in June from 41.6 in May. However, any reading below 50 indicates
contraction in the sector.

"The rapid recovery is partly a rebound following the deep fall in the
spring, but is also supported by the easing of restrictions on the
corona virus," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-index, order intake increased in June. The employment
index rose marginally, yet signaled decline in jobs. Suppliers' delivery
time declined and [business][1] plans were more optimistic.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
48.7 in June from 41.1 in the previous month.

"Although the rise for a single month is not to be interpreted, the
downward trend has been broken and the coming months will be a test if
the recovery in business continues," Kennemar said.
