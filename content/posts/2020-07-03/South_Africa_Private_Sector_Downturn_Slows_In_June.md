South Africa's private sector contracted at a softer pace in June as the
government relaxed the lockdown restrictions imposed to slow the spread
of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Friday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a three-month high of
42.5 in June from a record low 32.5 in May. Any reading below 50
indicates contraction in the sector.

Output and new [business][2] declined further in June, with the rate of
fall weaker than the previous month. Demand decreased at the slowest
rate since March.

New export orders declined at a softer pace in June and new business
fell by [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) standard.

Employment continued to decline in June, and input purchases and stock
levels curbed as firms eased cost pressure.

Firms are confident about the growth in the next 12-months in June and
was optimistic despite easing lockdown measures.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened for the seventeenth straight month
in June and lower staffs led to decline in supplier performance.

Input cost fell for the second month in a row in June and purchasing
prices were reduced at a softer pace. Output charges eased sharply for
the second consecutive month.

"This relaxation of COVID-19-related measures came despite the continued
rise in case numbers, as President Ramaphosa reportedly opted to
preserve economic livelihoods and boost the ailing South African
[economy][3]," David Owen, Economist at IHS Markit, said.

"However, demand levels still remain weak, and the growing surge of
COVID-19 cases will likely worry consumers going forward," Owen added.
