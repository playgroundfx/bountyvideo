The pace of deterioration in the UK service sector slowed sharply in
June, as more businesses reopened and started operating after meeting
the social distancing requirements meant to fight the [coronavirus][1],
or Covid-19, pandemic.

The final CIPS UK services Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, climbed
to 47.1 from 29 in May, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Friday.
The flash for June was 47.

The latest reading was the highest in four months and well above April's
record low of 13.4.

However, a score below 50 suggests contraction in the sector.

"Encouragingly, more than one-in-four service providers reported an
expansion of new [business][2] during June, which was commonly
attributed to pent up demand and the phased restart of the UK economy,"
Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.

"However, lockdown measures continued to hold back travel and leisure,
while companies across all main categories of service activity commented
on subdued underlying business and consumer spending in the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic."

New work fell at the slowest pace since the downturn began in March, as
businesses and consumers remained cautious. Export demand continued to
fall at a steeper rate than domestic orders, largely due to
international travel restrictions.

Backlogs continued to be depleted at a steep rate signaling excess
capacity. The pace of job shedding was the slowest since the downturn
started in March.

More than half of the survey panel, 53 percent, anticipate a rise in
business activity during the year ahead, compared to 21 percent that
foresee a decline, the survey showed. The business expectations index
hit a four-month high in June.

For a fourth straight month, price discounting was reported across the
service sector, but cost burdens were broadly unchanged. Higher average
costs due to spending on PPE and reduced operating capacity, lower fuel
bills and reduced payroll costs were among the factor influencing
pricing in June.

The final composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose
to 47.7 in June from 30.0 in May. This was the highest reading for four
months, yet below the neutral 50.0 mark. The flash reading for June was
47.6.

Earlier, survey data had shown that the manufacturing PMI rose to 50.7
in June, thus signaling modest growth in the sector.
