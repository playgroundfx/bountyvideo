Italy's industrial production declined in August, data published by the
statistical office Istat showed on Monday.

Industrial production decreased 0.2 percent in August from July, when
output gained 1 percent. This was the first fall in three months and
smaller than the economists' forecast of -0.3 percent.

Among components, only capital goods output reported monthly growth in
August, which was up 0.8 percent. Energy output dropped 2.1 percent and
consumer goods fell 2 percent. Intermediate goods output decreased 1.3
percent.  
  
Year-on-year, industrial output remained unchanged in August after
rising 7.2 percent in July.

On an unadjusted basis, annual growth in industrial production came in
at 3.1 percent, down from 4 percent in July.
