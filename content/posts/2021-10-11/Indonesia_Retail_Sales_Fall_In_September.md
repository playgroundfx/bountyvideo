Indonesia retail sales decreased in September, results of a survey by
Bank Indonesia showed on Monday.

Retail sales fell 1.1 percent month-on-month in September, after a 2.1
percent growth in August.

The latest growth was mainly due to increasing sales of spare parts and
accessories, and food, beverages and tobacco.

On a yearly basis, retail sales declined 1.8 percent in September,
following a 2.1 percent fall in the previous month.

Retailers expect inflationary pressure increased in the coming three
months ending in February 2022.
