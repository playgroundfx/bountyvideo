Czech consumer price inflation accelerated more-than-expected in
September, data from the Czech Statistical Office revealed on Monday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 4.9 percent in September from 4.1
percent in August. This was well above the economists' forecast of 4.5
percent.

This acceleration of price growth came mainly from higher prices in
'housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels' and in 'transport'.

Prices of goods in total and services went up 4.4 percent and 5.7
percent, respectively.  
  
On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.2 percent in September,
confounding expectations for a drop of 0.2 percent.
