Australia's central bank maintained its interest rate and the target
yield on three-year government bonds as [economy][1] experiences severe
downturn after measures taken to stem the spread of coronavirus, or
Covid-19.

At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia
board kept its interest rate at a record low 0.25 percent and the
targeted yield on three-year government bonds at around 0.25 percent.

Since the bank launched its asset purchase programme in March, it has
purchased about A$50 billion securities.

"The Bank is prepared to scale-up these purchases again and will do
whatever is necessary to ensure bond [markets][2] remain functional and
to achieve the yield target for 3-year AGS," Governor Philip Lowe said
in a statement.

The RBA broadened the range of eligible collateral for the asset
purchase plan to include Australian dollar securities issued by non-bank
corporations with an investment grade credit rating.  
  
The central bank said the target will remain in place until progress is
being made towards the goals for full employment and inflation.

The bank said it is committed to do what it can to support jobs, incomes
and businesses during this difficult period and to make sure that
Australia is well placed for the expected recovery.

Policymakers observed that the Australian economy is going through a
very difficult period and there is considerable uncertainty about the
outlook and inflation is expected to remain below 2 percent over the
next few years.
