A report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday
showed U.S. service sector activity contracted for the first time since
December of 2009 in the month of April.

The ISM said its non-manufacturing index tumbled to 41.8 in April from
52.5 in March, with a reading below 50 indicating a contraction in
service sector activity.

The non-manufacturing index slumped to its lowest level since hitting
40.1 in March of 2009 but still came in above economist estimates for a
reading of 36.8.

A note from economists at Oxford Economics pointed out the index would
have fallen even further were it not for a record rise in the supplier
deliveries index caused by supply chain disruptions.

The report said the supplier deliveries index spiked to a record high
78.3 in April from 62.1 in March, with a reading above 50 indicating
slower deliveries.

"Non-manufacturing conditions overall are dire as [business][1] activity
and employment both plunged to record lows while new orders indicate
sparse activity in the pipeline," said the economists at Oxford
Economics.

The steep drop by the headline index came as the business activity index
plummeted to 26.0 in April from 48.0 in March and the new orders index
plunged to 32.9 from 52.9.

The employment index also showed a nosedive to 30.0 in April from 47.0
in March, indicating employment in the service sector contracted for the
second month in a row.

On the other hand, the report said the prices index rose to 55.1 in
April from 50.0 in March, suggesting prices increased after coming in
unchanged in the previous month.

The ISM released a separate report last Friday showing U.S.
manufacturing activity continued to contract in the month of April.

The report said the purchasing managers index slumped to 41.5 in April
from 49.1 in March, with a reading below 50 indicating a contraction in
manufacturing activity.
