Australia's central bank maintained its interest rate and the target
yield on three-year government bonds.

At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia
board kept its interest rate at a record low 0.25 percent and the
targeted yield on three-year government bonds at around 0.25 percent.

The bank said the target will remain in place until progress is being
made towards the goals for full employment and inflation.

The bank said it is committed to do what it can to support jobs, incomes
and businesses during this difficult period and to make sure that
Australia is well placed for the expected recovery.
