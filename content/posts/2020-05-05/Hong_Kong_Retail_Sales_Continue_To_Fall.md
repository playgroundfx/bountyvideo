Hong Kong's retail sales fell for the fourteenth straight month in
March, figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Tuesday.

The retail sales volume declined 43.8 percent year-on-year in March,
following a 46.7 percent decrease in February.

The value of retail sales decreased 42.0 percent annually in March,
following a 44.0 percent fall in the preceding month.

Sales value of jewelry, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts declined
75.2 percent annually in March. Sales of clothing, footwear and allied
products declined 66.4 percent and those of department stores fell by
42.7 percent.

In the first quarter, the value of retail sales declined 35.0 percent
annually and the volume fell by 36.9 percent.

On a quarterly basis, the retail sales value decreased 19.6 percent in
the first quarter and the volume declined by 20.4 percent.

"Retail sales continued to plummet in March, as the COVID 19 pandemic
and resulting anti-epidemic measures brought inbound tourism to a
standstill and seriously disrupted consumption-related activities," a
government spokesman said.

"The [business][1] environment for retail trade will remain very
difficult in the near term amid the deep economic recession and sharp
deterioration in the labour market," spokesman added.
