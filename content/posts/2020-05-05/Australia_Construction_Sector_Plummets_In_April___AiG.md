The construction sector in Australia continued to contract in April, and
at a much steeper pace due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the latest survey
from the Australian Industry Group revealed on Tuesday with a
Performance of Construction Index score of 21.6.

That's down sharply from 37.9 in March and it moves further beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Activity, new orders, employment and average wages all fell to their
lowest levels on record for the Australian PCI. Capacity utilized across
the construction industry fell to a 12-year low. Supplier deliveries
fell to their lowest since 2012.
