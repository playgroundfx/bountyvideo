Australia's service sector contracted at a record pace in April as
strict measures to contain the [coronavirus][1] disease outbreak
impacted the activity, survey data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia Services Business Activity Index fell
steeply to 19.5 in April from 38.5 in March.

A score below 50 indicates contraction. The reading indicated a decrease
in activity unsurpassed in the four-year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

At the same time, the composite output index plunged to 21.7 in April
from 39.4 in March. The severe fall in services [business][2] activity
led the overall downturn in Australia's private sector.

Manufacturing output also fell at a steep and record pace in April.
