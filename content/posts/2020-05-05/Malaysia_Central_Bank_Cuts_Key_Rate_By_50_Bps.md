Malaysia's central bank reduced its interest rate by 50 basis points to
cushion the impact of the economic shock caused by the [coronavirus][1],
or covid-19, pandemic.

The Bank Negara Malaysia on Tuesday cut the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate to
2.00 percent from 2.50 percent.

The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR were
correspondingly reduced to 2.25 percent and 1.75 percent, respectively.

The bank had earlier reduced its rate in January and March.

The bank said it will utilize its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers as appropriate to create
enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery.

Policymakers observed that economic conditions would be particularly
challenging in the first half of the year. However, the fiscal stimulus
measures along with monetary easing will provide some support to the
[economy][2].

The outlook for growth continues to be subject to a high degree of
uncertainty, particularly with respect to developments surrounding the
pandemic, the bank said.
