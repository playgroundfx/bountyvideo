Indonesia's economic growth eased more than expected in the first
quarter as the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, outbreak weighed heavily
on consumption, investment and tourism, official data showed Tuesday.

Gross domestic product climbed 2.97 percent on a yearly basis in the
first quarter, much slower than the 4.97 percent expansion seen in the
fourth quarter. Economists had forecast the [economy][2] to grow 4.04
percent.

Quarter-on-quarter, GDP shrank 2.41 percent in the first quarter, which
was faster than the expected fall of 1.27 percent.

The expenditure-side of GDP showed that household consumption rose only
2.84 percent annually and government spending advanced 3.74 percent in
the first quarter.

Investment rose 1.7 percent and exports gained 0.24 percent. Meanwhile,
imports fell 2.19 percent.

Earlier, the government had downgraded its growth projection for this
year to 2.3 percent and cautioned that the economy could even shrink in
a worst case scenario.

Gareth Leather at Capital Economics said Indonesia was later than other
countries to lockdown its economy, meaning more of the hit will have
fallen in the second quarter. The economist expects a sharp contraction
in the three months to June period.

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sidelined for the time being, fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
likely be counted on to support the economy, with the second quarter
likely to fall into contraction as Covid-19 cases continue to rise,
despite President Jokowi's partial lockdown measures, Nicholas Mapa, an
ING economist added.
