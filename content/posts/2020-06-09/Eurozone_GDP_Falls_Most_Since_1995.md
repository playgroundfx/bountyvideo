The euro area [economy][1] contracted at the fastest pace since 1995 as
member countries initiated coronavirus containment measures in March,
the revised estimate published by Eurostat showed on Tuesday.

Gross domestic product declined 3.6 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, but slower than the initial estimate of -3.8 percent.

Nonetheless, this was the biggest contraction since the time series
began in 1995. The fall reversed a 0.1 percent growth logged in the
fourth quarter of 2019.

On a yearly basis, GDP shrank 3.1 percent, reversing previous quarter's
1 percent expansion. The first quarter rate was revised from -3.3
percent and was the largest fall since the third quarter of 2009.

The expenditure-side breakdown of GDP showed that household spending
dropped 4.7 percent and gross fixed capital formation was down 4.3
percent from the fourth quarter. At the same time, government spending
dropped 0.4 percent.

Exports and imports decreased 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.

Further, data showed that the number of employed persons decreased by
0.2 percent on quarter in the first quarter, which was the first decline
in the time series since the second quarter of 2013.

On a yearly basis, employment grew 0.4 percent but weaker than the 1.1
percent increase seen in the previous three months.

About 160.4 million were employed in the first quarter, down 0.3 million
from the previous quarter.

Eurostat said while the effect of the [coronavirus][2], or Covid-19,
pandemic on employment in persons was mitigated by government support
schemes, the impact on hours worked is generally much more pronounced.
The number of hours worked decreased by 3.1 percent sequentially.  
  
In the first quarter, the EU27 shrank 3.2 percent from the previous
quarter, the biggest fall since 1995. Year-on-year, GDP was down 2.6
percent, the largest since 2009.

The quarter-on-quarter change in GDP was revised from -3.5 percent and
the annual rate from -2.7 percent.
