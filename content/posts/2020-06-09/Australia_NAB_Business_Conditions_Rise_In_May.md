Australia's [business][1] conditions and confidence improved in May but
remained deeply negative, survey data from National Australia Bank
showed Tuesday.

The business conditions index gained 10 points to -24 in May after
hitting the lowest level since the global financial crisis.

While improvement in conditions was broad-based across industries,
conditions in services industries remained notably weaker.

The increase in conditions was driven by an improvement in trading
conditions and profitability, while the employment index logged a more
moderate improvement.

At the same time, the business confidence index advanced to -20 in May
from -45 in April.

Business confidence increased from its low point in March, but remained
weak with a current reading last seen around the trough in the 1990s
recession.

With [coronavirus][2] containment measures having generally been eased,
although to varying degrees across the states, there have seen some
pickup in activity, the NAB said. However, uncertainty remains high both
globally and domestically and businesses likely remain concerned about
how quickly they will return to full capacity.
