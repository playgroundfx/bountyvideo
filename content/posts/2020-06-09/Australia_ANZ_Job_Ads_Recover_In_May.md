Australia's job advertisement recovered in May, data from ANZ showed on
Tuesday.

Job ads rose 0.5 percent month-on-month in May, after a 53.4 percent
decrease in April.

On an annual basis, job ads decreased 59.8 percent in May, following a
62.3 percent fall in the previous month. This was the seventeenth
consecutive fall.

"The week-to-week movements are more promising, with job ads improving
steadily during May, from a low point at the beginning of the month,"
ANZ Senior Economist, Catherine Birch, said.

"This is consistent with the gradual rollback of COVID-19 restrictions,
which has allowed some businesses to reopen, extend trading hours or
increase activity and is seeing a recovery in household spending," Birch
said.
