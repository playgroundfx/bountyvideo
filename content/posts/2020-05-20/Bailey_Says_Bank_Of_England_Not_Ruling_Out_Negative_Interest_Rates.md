Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK central bank is
currently reviewing all its tools and it would be foolish to rule out
any one of them, including negative interest rates.  
  
"We do not rule things out as a matter of principle," Bailey told
lawmakers at a Treasury committee hearing on Wednesday.

Specifically on negative interest rates, the BoE Chief said, "We're not
ruling it in, and we're not ruling it out."

UK interest rates are now at a record low 0.1 percent.  
  
Bailey said [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are studying the experience of other central
banks with negative rates. The Bank of Japan and the European Central
Bank have negative interest rates.  
  
BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent, who was also present at the hearing,
hinted that the recovery could be shaped like a a 'lopsided' V.  
  
The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker said that the recovery is unlikely to be immediate, but
a longer term process.

Official data released last week showed that that GDP dropped 2 percent
in the first quarter of 2020, which was the worst fall since the global
financial crisis of 2008.

The think tank NIESR has predicted that UK GDP is set to fall 25-30
percent in the second quarter, due to the impact of the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, and the lockdown imposed to curb the
pandemic.  
  
Elsewhere on Wednesday, the UK government sold a long-term bond at
negative yield for the first time.  
  
The government reportedly auctioned off GBP 3.75 billion of three-year
bonds at an average yield of -0.003 percent.  
  
Britain had sold short-term debt at negative yield in 2016.
