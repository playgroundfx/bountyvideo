Eurozone consumer confidence recovered slightly in May as several
countries in the single-currency bloc started easing restrictions placed
during the lockdown to slow the spread of the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, flash estimates from the European Union showed on Wednesday.  
  
The flash consumer confidence index for euro area climbed to -18.8 from
-22.7 in April. Economists had expected a further weakening to -24.  
  
The corresponding index for the EU rose to -19.5 from -22 in the
previous month.  
However, both indicators remained far below their long-term averages of
-11.1 and -10.4, respectively.  
  
The European Commission is set to publish the detail data along with the
full [business][2] and consumer survey results on May 28.
