Japan is scheduled to release April numbers for imports, exports and
trade balance, highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

Imports are expected to slide 12.9 percent on year after falling 5.0
percent in March. Exports are tipped to tumble an annual 22.7 percent
after sinking 11.7 percent in the previous month. The trade balance is
expected to show a deficit of 560 billion yen following the 4.9 billion
yen deficit a month earlier.

Japan also will see preliminary May results for the manufacturing,
services and composite purchasing managers index from Jibun Bank; in
April, their scores were 41.9, 21.5 and 25.8, respectively.

Hong Kong will see April figures for consumer prices, with forecasts
suggesting an annual increase of 1.8 percent - slowing from 2.3 percent
in March.

The central bank in the Philippines will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
meeting and then announce its decision on interest rates; the bank is
expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 2.75 percent.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Indonesia are closed on Thursday for the
Ascension and then will remain closed until May 28 for Eid-ul-Fitr.
