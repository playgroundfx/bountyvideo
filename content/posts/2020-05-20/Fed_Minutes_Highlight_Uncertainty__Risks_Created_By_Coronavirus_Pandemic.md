In addition to the severely adverse near-term effects of the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting noted the outbreak and the measures undertaken
to contain it have also created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty
and considerable risks to economic activity in the medium term.

The minutes said participants at the late-April meeting discussed
several alternative scenarios with regard to the behavior of economic
activity in the medium term that all seemed about equally likely.

"These scenarios differed in the assumed length of the pandemic and the
consequent economic disruptions," the Fed said.

A number of participants believed there was a substantial likelihood of
additional waves of the coronavirus outbreak, which could lead to
further economic disruptions.

The participants warned the disruptions, including additional periods of
mandatory social distancing, greater supply chain dislocations, and a
substantial number of [business][2] closures and loss of income, could
lead to a protracted period of severely reduced economic activity.

At the same time, the minutes noted economic activity could recover more
quickly if the pandemic subsided enough for households and businesses to
become sufficiently confident to relax or modify social-distancing
behaviors over the next several months.

"Participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of
[health][3]-care [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), together with actions by the
private sector, would be important in shaping the timing and speed of
the U.S. [economy][4]'s return to more normal conditions," the Fed said.

The central bank added, "In addition, participants agreed that recent
actions taken by the Federal Reserve were essential in helping reduce
downside risks to the economic outlook."

Meanwhile, the minutes noted the pandemic also poses several risks to
long-term economic performance, including that workers who lose
employment may experience a loss of skills, lose access to adequate
childcare or eldercare, or become discouraged and exit the labor force.

The Fed said the longer-term behavior of firms could be affected as
well, while a few participants warned higher levels of government
indebtedness could put downward pressure on growth in aggregate
potential output.

Following the meeting, the Fed decided to maintain the target range for
the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent, as the public health crisis
weighs heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the
near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the
medium term.

The minutes reiterated the central bank is committed to using its full
range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time,
thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.
