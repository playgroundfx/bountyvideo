Indonesia's foreign tourist arrivals for September decreased 15.08
percent from the same month last year, data from the statistical office
showed Monday.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the foreign tourist arrivals increased
1.41 percent.  
  
The number of foreign tourist visits totaled 126,510 in September, the
agency said.  
  
In the January to September period, the number of foreign tourist visits
slumped 67.0 percent year-on-year to 1.19 million.  
  
The number of domestic air transport passengers increased 84.04 percent
in September, the agency said.  
  
Indonesia tourism is starting to recover gradually after the Covid-19
pandemic.  
  
On October 14, the country reopened the Bali island to visitors from
several countries. Initial reports suggested that demand for flights
slots and visas were less, but businesses are hopeful of demand picking
up by the end of the year.

The famed tourist destination was closed in April last year.
