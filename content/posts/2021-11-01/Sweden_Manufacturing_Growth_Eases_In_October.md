Sweden's manufacturing expansion eased in October, yet remained robust,
survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on
Monday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector fell to 64.4
in October from 64.7 in September.

The latest reading increased for the fifteenth month in a row. A PMI
reading above 50 suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

"Swedish industry seems to have withstood an increased shortage of
inputs and disruptions in global delivery flows well and shows a higher
level of activity in October compared to the Eurozone where PMI has
reached the lowest level since last winter," Swedbank analyst Jorgen
Kennemar said.

Among the sub-indexes, production, inventory purchases and delivery time
decreased, while employment increased.

Cost pressure increased in October. Suppliers' raw material and
intermediate goods tocks rose to a new record high.
