The Dutch manufacturing sector growth accelerated further on robust
output and employment in October, survey results from IHS Markit showed
on Monday.

The Nevi Netherlands manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to
62.5 from September's seven-month low of 62.0.

The headline index has registered above 60.0 for eight successive
months, indicating sustained rapid growth of the sector.

New orders and output rose at similarly marked rates, while growth of
employment and stocks of purchases were among the strongest ever
recorded in the 21-year survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), the survey showed.

Suppliers' delivery times continued to lengthen to a near-record degree,
further boosting the PMI.

October data also indicated a record rise in output prices, reflecting
surging cost burdens.
