Kazakhstan's manufacturing sector growth rose for the second straight
month in October, survey data from Tengri Partners and IHS Markit showed
Monday.

The purchasing manager's index, or PMI, for the manufacturing sector
rose to 51.6 in October from 50.3 in September. Any reading above 50
suggests expansion in the sector.

[business][1] rose for the seventh month in a row.

Production volumes grew for the second straight month in October and
backlogs of work declined for the first time in six months.

Employment declined for the fourth month in a row in October. Suppliers'
delivery time lengthened.

Input cost and output prices rose at the sharpest rates in three months
in October.

The 12-month outlook for production remained optimistic and sentiment
