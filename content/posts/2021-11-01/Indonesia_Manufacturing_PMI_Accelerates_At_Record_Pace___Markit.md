The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to expand in October,
the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Monday with a record
Manufacturing PMI score of 57.2.

That's up from 52.2 in September and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Supporting the higher headline PMI reading were steeper increases in new
work and output in October, which both expanded at record rates.
Anecdotal evidence suggested that a relative improvement in the domestic
COVID-19 situation, coupled with further easing of restrictions, enabled
demand to grow and the [economy][1] to recover.

However, foreign demand contracted once again, albeit marginally. Given
the stronger overall demand, manufacturers looked to expand their
operating capacities by raising their workforce numbers for the first
time in four months, albeit slightly. Backlogs of work nevertheless
increased, though the rate of growth eased from September.
