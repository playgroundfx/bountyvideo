Construction spending in the U.S. unexpectedly decreased in the month of
September, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Monday.

The report said construction spending fell by 0.5 percent to an annual
rate of $1.574 trillion in September after inching up by 0.1 percent to
a revised rate of $1.582 trillion in August.

The drop in construction spending came as a surprise to economists, who
had expected spending to increase by 0.4 percent.

The unexpected decline in construction spending came as spending on
private construction slid by 0.5 percent to an annual rate of $1.230
trillion.

Spending on residential construction spending fell by 0.4 percent to a
rate of $773.5 billion, while spending on non-residential construction
dropped by 0.6 percent to a rate of $456.4 billion.

The report showed spending on public construction also slumped by 0.7
percent to an annual rate of $343.7 billion.

Spending on highway construction dropped by 0.7 percent to a rate of
$99.8 billion, offsetting a 0.9 percent increase in educational
construction to a rate of $80.7 billion.
