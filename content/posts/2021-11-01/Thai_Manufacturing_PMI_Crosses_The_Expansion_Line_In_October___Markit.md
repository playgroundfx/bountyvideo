The manufacturing sector in Thailand swung to expansion in October, the
latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 50.9.

That's up from 48.9 in September and it moves above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, manufacturing output rose for
a second straight month and at a survey record pace in October.
Panelists highlighted better domestic demand underpinning the increase
in production.

To meet the rise in output, buying activity was also ramped up at a
record speed. The observed improvements in domestic demand were not
matched by a rise in overall demand, however, as order book volumes
continued to fall. New [business][1] from abroad saw a third straight
month of contraction amid the lack of business travel.
