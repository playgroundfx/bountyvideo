The Greek manufacturing sector logged one of the strongest growth rates
in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 58.9 in October
from 58.4 in September. A score above 50.0 indicates expansion.

Central to the uptick was a marked increase in new order inflows. Firms
registered stronger client demand in both domestic and international
[markets][1].

However, output growth was hampered by severe supply constraints amid
material shortages and delivery delays. Meanwhile, staffing levels rose
at a marked and accelerated pace in October.

In line with greater client demand, firms raised their purchasing
activity at the start of the fourth quarter to secure input stocks amid
material shortages.

Input cost inflation accelerated to a fresh new series high.
Accommodative demand conditions allowed firms to partially pass on
higher costs, which they did so at a survey-record pace.

Further, the survey showed that firms remained widely upbeat about their
output prospects for the year ahead in October.
