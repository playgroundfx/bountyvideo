The manufacturing sector in Malaysia swung to expansion in October, the
latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 52.2.

That's up from 48.1 in September and it moves above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Both production and new order volumes returned to expansion territory in
October. Firms commonly attributed the increase in new orders to a
softening in pandemic restrictions, which spurred client confidence and
facilitated an increase in production levels in the domestic market.

Foreign demand for Malaysian manufactured goods meanwhile remained
subdued, though the pace of reduction in export sales was the softest
since May as firms noted pockets of stronger demand in Europe and the
U.S.
