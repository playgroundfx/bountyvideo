The manufacturing sector in Myanmar continued to contract in October,
albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics
revealed on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 43.3.

That's up from 41.1 in September although it remains beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Production volumes were again hampered by weak demand, material scarcity
and a lack of skilled workers in October. The military-staged coup and
the COVID-19 pandemic were also mentioned by panelists. The overall rate
of decline was sharp, but the softest since January.

Similarly, new orders fell sharply and for the fourteenth month running.
Firms mentioned that cash shortages, raw material scarcity and the
associated increase in selling prices weighed on demand. The contraction
was marked by [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) standards but eased for the third month in
succession.
