The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to expand in October, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Monday with a Manufacturing PMI score of 55.2.

That's up from 54.7 in September and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Helping to lift the headline figure was a stronger upturn in total new
work during October. The rate of growth picked up notably from
September's modest pace and was sharp overall, with companies citing
greater domestic and foreign demand. New export work rose solidly
overall, albeit to a weaker extent than in September.

Despite the steep rise in total sales, production growth remained mild
overall, with a number of companies commenting that supply shortages and
delays had restricted growth. As a result, outstanding [business][1]
rose rapidly, with the rate of accumulation picking up from that seen at
the end of the third quarter.
