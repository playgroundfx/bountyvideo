The manufacturing sector in Vietnam swung to expansion in October, the
latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 52.1.

That's up sharply from 40.2 in September and it moves above the boom-or-
bust lien of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

A loosening of COVID-19 restrictions led a number of firms to restart
production in October, while others expanded output in response to
higher new orders. As a result, production growth was recorded for the
first time in five months.

A solid return to growth of new orders was also registered as
manufacturers and their customers alike resumed operations. The
improvement in the pandemic situation enabled firms to take advantage of
increased demand in international [markets][1], posting a first rise in
new export orders since May.

Business confidence improved markedly in October as the latest wave of
the COVID-19 pandemic showed signs of easing. Hopes that the pandemic
will remain under control helped optimism reach a 29-month high.
