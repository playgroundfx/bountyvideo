Russia's manufacturing activity expanded in October, survey data from
IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The IHS Markit Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
rose to 51.6 in October from 49.8 in September. A PMI reading above 50
signals expansion in the sector.

Output rose marginally in October and new order inflow accelerated. New
export orders declined, while total sales increased.

Employment expanded for the first time in five months in October and
backlogs of work declined.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in October.

Input prices increased in October and the rate of charged inflation
quickened since the previous month.

Output expectation for the coming 12 months remained positive amid hopes
of greater client demand and new product development.

"Russian manufacturers signaled a return to expansionary territory in
October, as operating conditions improved for the first time since May,"
Sian Jones, senior economist at IHS Markit, said.
