A report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday
showed a modest slowdown in the pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing
activity in the month of October.

The ISM said its manufacturing index edged down to 60.8 in October from
61.1 in September, although a reading above 50 still indicates growth.
Economists had expected the index to dip to 60.5.

"Business Survey Committee panelists reported that their companies and
suppliers continue to deal with an unprecedented number of hurdles to
meet increasing demand," said Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM
Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. "All segments of the
manufacturing [economy][1] are impacted by record-long raw materials
lead times, continued shortages of critical materials, rising
commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products."

"Global pandemic-related issues — worker absenteeism, short-term
shutdowns due to parts shortages, difficulties in filling open positions
and overseas supply chain problems — continue to limit manufacturing
growth potential," he added. "However, panel sentiment remains strongly
optimistic, with four positive growth comments for every cautious
comment."

The modest decrease by the headline index came as the new orders index
slid to 59.8 in October from 66.7 in September.

The production index also edged down to 59.3 in October from 59.4 in
September, while the employment index rose to 52.0 from 50.2.

On the inflation front, the prices index climbed to 85.7 in October from
81.2 in September, indicating a faster rate of price growth.

The ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on activity in the
U.S. service sector on Wednesday. The services PMI is expected to come
in unchanged at 61.9.
