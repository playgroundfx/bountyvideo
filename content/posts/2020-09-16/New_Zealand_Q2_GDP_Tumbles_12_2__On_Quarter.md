New Zealand's gross domestic product dropped 12.2 percent on quarter in
the second quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday -
marking the country's largest single-quarter decline on record.

That actually beat forecasts for a decline of 12.8 percent following the
1.6 percent drop in the previous three months.

Service industries fell 10.9 percent on quarter, while primary
industries were down 8.7 percent and goods producing industries fell
16.3 percent.

GDP per capita fell 12.6 percent, while real gross disposable national
income was down 12.3 percent and annual GDP in the year to June 2020
declined by 2.0 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP sank 12.4 percent - again exceeding expectations
for a fall of 13.3 percent after easing 0.2 percent in the three months
prior.

Household spending declined 12.1 percent in June 2020 quarter, with
falls across all expenditure categories. Households spent less on
services such as restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food, domestic air
passenger services, and recreation and cultural activities.

Non-durable goods fell 11.1 percent, with lower spending on alcoholic
beverages and petrol leading the fall. Durable goods declined 14.1
percent, driven by fewer purchases of used and new motor vehicles.

Imports of goods and services recorded a large fall of 24.6 percent in
Q2, driven primarily by a 21.2 percent decline in goods imports. This
was driven by reduced demand for intermediate goods such as primary
fuels and lubricants; and capital goods such as transport equipment,
plant, and machinery.

The 33.0 percent fall in imports of services and the 39.9 percent fall
in exports of services were driven by sharp falls in travel services and
transport services, which continue to be heavily impacted by the closure
of New Zealand's border and travel restrictions around the world.

Exports of goods fell 7.0 percent, with agricultural, meat, and dairy
product exports performing relatively well. This contrasted against
larger declines seen in metal products; other food, beverages, and
tobacco; and wood and paper products.

Expenditure on gross fixed capital formation fell 20.8 percent. The
decline was driven by falls in residential and non-residential
construction, as well as reduced investment in plant, machinery, and
equipment.
