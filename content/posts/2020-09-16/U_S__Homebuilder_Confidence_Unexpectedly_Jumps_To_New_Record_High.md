Reflecting historic traffic numbers, the National Association of Home
Builders released a report on Wednesday showing homebuilder confidence
jumped to a record high in September.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index shot up to 83
in September from 78 in August. Economists had expected the index to
come in unchanged.

With the unexpected increase, the index rose to its highest level in the
35-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the series, surpassing the previous record high of 78
that was set last month and also matched in December 1998.

"The the suburban shift for home building is keeping builders busy,
supported on the demand side by low interest rates," said NAHB Chief
Economist Robert Dietz.

He added, "In another sign of this growing trend, builders in other
parts of the country have reported receiving calls from customers in
high-density [markets][1] asking about relocating."

The unexpected jump by the headline index came as the three component
indexes also reached record highs in September.

The measure charting traffic of prospective buyers spiked to 73 from 64,
the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months surged
up to 84 from 78 and the index gauging current sales conditions climbed
to 88 from 84.

However, NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke noted many in the housing industry
are worried about rising costs and delays for building materials,
especially lumber.

"More domestic lumber production or tariff relief is needed to avoid a
slowdown in the market in the coming months," Fowke said.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of August.

Housing starts are expected to dip to an annual rate of 1.478 million in
August after skyrocketing to a rate of 1.496 million in July.

Meanwhile, economists expect building permits, an indicator of future
housing demand, to rise to a rate of 1.520 million after spiking to a
rate of 1.495 million.
