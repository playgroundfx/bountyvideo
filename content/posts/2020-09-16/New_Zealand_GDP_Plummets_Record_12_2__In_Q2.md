New Zealand's gross domestic product saw its largest ever drop in the
second quarter of 2020, tumbling 12.2 percent, Statistics New Zealand
said on Thursday.

That actually beat forecasts for a decline of 12.8 percent following the
1.6 percent drop in the previous three months.

Service industries fell 10.9 percent on quarter, while primary
industries were down 8.7 percent and goods producing industries fell
16.3 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP sank 12.4 percent - again exceeding expectations
for a fall of 13.3 percent after easing 0.2 percent in the three months
prior.
