The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development upgraded its
global economic forecast for 2020 as output picked up swiftly following
the easing of [coronavirus][1] confinement measures and the initial re-
opening of businesses.

According to the interim report, released Wednesday, the global
[economy][2] will shrink 4.5 percent this year instead of 6 percent fall
estimated in June. Meanwhile, the growth projection for 2021 was revised
down to 5 percent from 5.2 percent.

The Paris-based agency noted that without the prompt and effective
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support introduced in all economies, the contraction in output
would have been substantially larger.

However, the agency cautioned that the economic outlook remains
exceptionally uncertain, with the Covid-19 pandemic continuing to exert
a substantial toll on economies and societies.

The report masks considerable differences across countries, with upward
revisions in China, the United States and Europe amid weaker-than-
expected outcomes in India, Mexico and South Africa.

The US 2020 GDP was forecast to fall 3.8 percent, which was revised
sharply from -7.3 percent projected in June. The growth outlook for next
year was lowered to 4 percent from 4.1 percent.

At the same time, China's GDP is expected to grow 1.8 percent versus
previous forecast of -2.6 percent. In 2021, growth outlook was lifted to
8 percent from 6.8 percent.

The OECD observed that China's activity returned quickly to pre-pandemic
levels by the end of the second quarter, fuelled by strong
infrastructure investment.

Eurozone GDP is seen falling 7.9 percent this year before expanding 5.1
percent in 2021. In June, the OECD had forecast a 9.1 percent fall in
2020 and 3.7 percent growth for next year.

Meanwhile, India's GDP outlook was revised down sharply to -10.2 percent
from -3.7 percent projected in June. But growth is expected to rebound
10.7 percent next year, which was revised up by 2.8 percentage points.

The agency upgraded the fall in UK GDP to -10.1 percent from 11.5
percent this year, while growth forecast for 2021 was lowered to 7.6
percent from 9 percent.
