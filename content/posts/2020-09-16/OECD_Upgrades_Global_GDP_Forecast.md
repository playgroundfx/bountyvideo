The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development raised its
global economic forecast for 2020 as output picked up swiftly following
the easing of confinement measures and the initial re-opening of
businesses.  
  
According to the interim economic outlook report, released Wednesday,
the global [economy][1] will shrink 4.5 percent this year instead of 6
percent fall estimated in June. Meanwhile, the growth projection for
2021 was revised down to 5 percent from 5.2 percent.

The Paris-based agency noted that without the prompt and effective
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support introduced in all economies, the contraction in output
would have been substantially larger.

However, the agency cautioned that the outlook is subject to
considerable uncertainty and projections are dependent on assumptions
about the spread of the Covid-19 virus and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) developments.

The US GDP was forecast to fall 3.8 percent, which was revised sharply
from -7.3 percent projected for 2020. The growth outlook for next year
was lowered to 4 percent from 4.1 percent.

At the same time, China's GDP is expected to grow 1.8 percent versus
previous forecast of -2.6 percent. In 2021, growth outlook was lifted to
8 percent from 6.8 percent.
