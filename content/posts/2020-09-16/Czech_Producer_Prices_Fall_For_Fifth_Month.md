The Czech Republic's producer prices declined for the fifth straight
month in August, figures from the Czech Statistical Office showed on
Wednesday.

The industrial producer price index decreased 0.5 percent year-on-year
in August, following a 0.1 percent decline in July. Economists had
expected a 0.1 percent fall.

Prices for mining and quarrying declined 3.5 percent annually in August
and manufacturing cost fell 2.0 percent. Prices for energy and
intermediate goods fell by 1.8 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively.

Meanwhile, prices for electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning grew
7.9 percent. Prices for water supply and food, beverages and tobacco,
rose by 6.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices fell 0.3 percent in August, largely
due to a rise in prices for coke, refined petroleum products. Economists
had expected a 0.1 percent rise.
