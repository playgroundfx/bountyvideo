France inflation accelerated in November, as initially estimated, driven
by the surge in energy prices, final data from the statistical office
Insee showed on Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 2.8 percent in November from 2.6
percent in October. This was the fastest since September 2008 and
matched the preliminary estimate published on November 30.

The increase reflected a 21.6 percent rise in energy prices and a 0.8
percent gain in manufactured goods prices. Prices of food grew at a
slower pace of 0.5 percent.

Consumer prices grew 0.4 percent on month, the same rate as seen in
October, and in line with flash estimate.

EU harmonized inflation accelerated to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent in
October.

Month-on-month, the harmonized index of consumer prices grew 0.4
percent, as seen in the previous month. Both annual and monthly HICP
rates were confirmed.

Core inflation increased to 1.7 percent from 1.4 percent in the previous
month.
