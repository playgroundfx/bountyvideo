The Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a report on Wednesday
unexpectedly showing a modest acceleration in the pace of growth in
regional manufacturing activity in the month of December.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index inched
up to 31.9 in December from 30.9 in November, with a positive reading
indicating growth. The uptick surprised economists, who had expected the
index to pull back to 20.5.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months, although optimism is
still lower than it was in the fall.
