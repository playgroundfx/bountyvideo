Department released a report on Wednesday showing U.S. import prices
increased in line with economist estimates in the month of November.

Economists had expected import prices to advance by 0.7 percent compared
to the 1.2 percent jump originally reported for the previous month.

Meanwhile, the report said export prices shot up by 1.0 percent in
November after spiking by an upwardly revised 1.6 percent in October.

Economists had expected export prices to rise by 0.5 percent compared to
the 1.5 percent surge originally reported for the previous month.
