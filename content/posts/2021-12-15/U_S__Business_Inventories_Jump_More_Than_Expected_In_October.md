Business inventories in the U.S. jumped by more than anticipated in the
month of October, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Wednesday.

The report said [business][1] inventories surged up by 1.2 percent in
October after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.8 percent in September.

Economists had expected business inventories to advance by 0.9 percent
compared to the 0.7 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Wholesale inventories led the way higher, spiking by 2.3 percent, while
manufacturing inventories climbed by 0.8 percent and retail inventories
inched up by 0.1 percent.

The Commerce Department also said business sales soared by 2.1 percent
in October after jumping by 1.2 percent in September.

Wholesale sales shot up by 2.2 percent during the month, while
manufacturing and retail inventories both leapt by 2.0 percent.

With sales jumping by more than inventories, the total business
inventories/sales ratio dipped to 1.24 in October from 1.26 in
September.
