Despite inflation concerns and ongoing production bottlenecks, the
National Association of Home Builders released a report on Wednesday
showing a modest improvement in U.S. homebuilder confidence in the month
of December.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index inched up to
84 in December from 83 in November, reaching its highest level since a
matching reading in February. The uptick came in line with economist
estimates.

The modest increase by the headline index came as the index gauging
current sales conditions crept up to 90 in December from 89 in November
and the gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers edged up to 70 from
69.

Meanwhile, the component measuring sales expectations in the next six
months held steady at 84 for the third consecutive month.

"The most pressing issue for the housing sector remains lack of
inventory," said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. "Building has
increased but the industry faces constraints, namely cost/availability
of materials, labor and lots."

He added, "While 2021 single-family starts are expected to end the year
24% higher than the pre-Covid 2019 level, we expect higher interest
rates in 2022 will put a damper on housing affordability."

On Thursday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of November.

Housing starts are expected to surge by 3.0 percent to an annual rate of
1.565 million in November, while building permits are expected to rise
by 0.4 percent to a rate of 1.660 million.
