After reporting a sharp increase in U.S. retail sales in the previous
month, the Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing
retail sales rose by much less than expected in the month of November.

The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up by 0.3 percent in
November after soaring by an upwardly revised 1.8 percent in October.

Economists had expected retail sales to increase by 0.8 percent compared
to the 1.7 percent spike originally reported for the previous month.

"U.S. consumers spent at a moderate clip in November as persistent
supply shortages and elevated prices tempered consumers' willingness and
ability to spend on goods," said Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

The uptick in retail sales reflected notable sales growth by gas
stations, food and beverage stores and sporting goods, hobby, musical
instrument, and book stores.

However, substantial decreases in sales by department stores and
electronics and appliance stores limited the upside.

The report also showed sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers edged
down by 0.1 percent in November after spiking by 1.7 percent in October.

Excluding sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail sales still
rose by 0.3 percent in November after surging by 1.8 percent in October.
Ex-auto sales were expected to jump by 1.0 percent.

Closely watched core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline,
building materials and food services, slipped by 0.1 percent in November
after soaring by 1.8 percent in October.

"Looking ahead, strong labor income growth, elevated excess savings and
healthy balance sheets should support robust consumer spending momentum
in the year ahead," Daco said.

"Still, downside risks to the outlook are rising given the renewed
deterioration in the [health][1] situation," he added. "Even absent a
significant drag on growth from the Omicron variant, the expected
rotation in the consumer spending mix away from goods will mean cooler
retail sales in 2022."
