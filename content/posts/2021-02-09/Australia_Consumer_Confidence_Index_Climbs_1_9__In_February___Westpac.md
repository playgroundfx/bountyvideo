Consumer confidence in Australia improved in February, the latest survey
from Westpac Bank and the Melbourne Institute revealed on Wednesday as
their sentiment index rose 1.9 percent to a reading of 109.1.

That follows the 4.5 percent drop in January to 107.0.

The management of the pandemic locally has had a constructive effect on
confidence. The success of [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) tracing and light-handed lockdowns
has been important in containing a worrying cluster of cases since the
last survey in January.

The Reserve Bank's surprise extension of its Quantitative Easing program
signals ongoing commitment from the monetary authorities to supporting
the Australian [economy][1]. Consistent positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the recovery of
the job market would also have boosted confidence.

Nationally, confidence has clearly lifted substantially above pre-
pandemic levels. The overall Index is now 14.2 percent above its pre-
pandemic level in February 2020.
