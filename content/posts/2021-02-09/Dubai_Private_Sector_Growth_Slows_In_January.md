Dubai's non-oil private sector grew at a softer pace in January, survey
data from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 50.6 in January from 51.0 in
December. Any score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Business activity rose for the second straight month in January, albeit
at a softer pace. Employment grew for the first time since February last
year.

Business confidence for the 12 months outlook improved due to the rapid
vaccine roll-out in the UAE.

Sales grew at the slowest pace seen in the current eight-month sequence
of expansion.

On the price front, input costs declined for the first time in six
months and at the quickest pace since April last year. Average selling
prices declined slightly.

Suppliers' delivery time shortened for the second straight month in
January.

"Uncertainty surrounding the near-term economic outlook and the prospect
of tighter pandemic measures meant that output expectations across
Dubai's non-oil sector remained subdued in January, despite picking up
from the end of 2020," IHS Markit economist David Owen said.
