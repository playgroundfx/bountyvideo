UK retail sales declined for the first time since last spring as the
current lockdown has hit non-essential retailers harder than in
November, data from the British Retail Consortium showed Tuesday.

Total sales decreased 1.3 percent on a yearly basis in January, while
like-for-like sales grew 7.1 percent.

"The current lockdown has hit non-essential retailers harder than in
November, with the new variant hampering consumer confidence and leading
customers to hold back on spending - especially on clothing and
footwear," Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

"Meanwhile, retailers have worked incredibly hard to expand their online
delivery and click and collect offerings to ensure everyone can get the
products they need during lockdown," Dickinson added.

Data from Barclaycard showed that consumer spending dropped 16.3 percent
in January, the biggest fall since May. On the other hand, supermarket
spending advanced 17 percent. Further, data showed that online retail
spending surged 73 percent.
