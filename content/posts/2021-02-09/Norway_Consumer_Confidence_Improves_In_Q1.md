Norwegian consumer confidence improved in the first quarter of this year
as households started expecting an end to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic
with the start of vaccinations, results of a survey by Finance Norway
showed Tuesday.  
  
The expectations barometer climbed to -5.1 from -9.2 in the fourth
quarter of 2020.  
  
"The barometer now indicates that most households are confident in their
own finances and have both funds and a desire for increased consumption
when large parts of the population have been vaccinated," Finance Norway
CEO Idar Kreutzer said.

"This will help lift activity in the Norwegian [economy][2]."
