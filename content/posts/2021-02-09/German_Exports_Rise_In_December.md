Germany's exports managed to grow in December, despite restrictions
imposed to contain the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, underpinned by demand
from China and the U.S., data from Destatis revealed on Tuesday.

Exports gained 0.1 percent on month, slower than the 2.3 percent
increase in November. Economists had forecast a monthly fall of 1
percent.

At the same time, imports decreased 0.1 percent, following a 5.4 percent
rebound logged a month ago. Imports were expected to decline more
sharply by 1.1 percent.  
  
As a result, the trade surplus remained almost unchanged at a seasonally
adjusted EUR 16 billion in December. The expected level was EUR 15.9
billion.

Year-on-year, exports advanced 2.7 percent, reversing a 1.2 percent drop
in the previous month. At the same time, the annual growth in imports
accelerated to 3.5 percent from 0.5 percent.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus totaled EUR 14.8 billion
versus EUR 15.1 billion in the same period last year.

The current account surplus increased to EUR 28.2 billion from EUR 25.3
billion in the prior year.

Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said the revival of the traditional
German growth driver, exports, came at the right moment and helped in
avoiding a contraction of the [economy][2] in the final quarter of 2020.

The longer-term outlook, however, remains mixed, illustrating that the
sector will still take some time before returning to full strength, the
economist added.

Data showed that exports to China advanced 11.6 percent and that to the
United States climbed 8.4 percent in December. This was the first annual
increase in German exports to the U.S. since February 2020.

Imports from China grew 15.7 percent and that from the U.S. gained 2.2
percent in December.

In 2020 as a whole, German exports decreased 9.3 percent and imports
were down 7.1 percent. These were the largest annual decreases in both
exports and imports since the financial and economic crisis in 2009.

The foreign trade balance showed a surplus of EUR 179.1 billion in 2020.
This means that the German export surplus declined for the fourth year
in a row, Destatis said.
