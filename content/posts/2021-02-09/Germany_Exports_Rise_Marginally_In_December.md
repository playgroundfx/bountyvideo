German exports rose marginally in December, data from Destatis revealed
on Tuesday.

Exports gained 0.1 percent on month, slower than the 2.3 percent
increase in November. Economists had forecast a monthly fall of 1
percent.

At the same time, imports decreased 0.1 percent, following a 5.4 percent
rebound logged a month ago. Imports were expected to decline more
sharply by 1.1 percent.

The trade surplus remained almost unchanged at a seasonally adjusted EUR
16 billion in December. The expected level was EUR 15.9 billion.

Year-on-year, exports advanced 2.7 percent, reversing a 1.2 percent drop
in the previous month. At the same time, the annual growth in imports
accelerated to 3.5 percent from 0.5 percent.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus totaled EUR 14.8 billion
versus EUR 15.1 billion in the same period last year.

The current account surplus increased to EUR 28.2 billion from EUR 25.3
billion in the prior year.
