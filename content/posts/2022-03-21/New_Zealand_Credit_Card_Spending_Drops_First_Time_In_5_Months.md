New Zealand credit card spending dropped for the first time in five
months in February as authorities began to put in place restrictions
after the number of Omicron infections rose, data from the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand revealed on Monday.

Total credit card billings declined 2.6 percent monthly in February,
after remaining unchanged in January. This was the first the decline
since September, when spending shrank 5.4 percent.

Domestic billings rose 3.2 percent monthly to NZ$3.173 billion, while
overseas billings fell to NZ$291 million in February, data showed.

The downturn was similar to August 2021 when the country was in Alert
level 4 lockdown, the bank said.

On a yearly basis, total billings rose 1.0 percent in February, after a
5.1 percent increase in the previous month.
