Germany's producer prices continued to accelerate on energy prices in
February, data published by Destatis showed on Monday.

Producer price inflation accelerated further to 25.9 percent in February
from 25.0 percent in January. Nonetheless, this was slightly slower than
the expected growth of 26.2 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices gained 1.4 percent, slower than the
2.2 percent increase in the previous month and also the economists'
forecast of 1.7 percent.

Destatis said the recent price developments in the context of Russia's
attack on Ukraine are not yet included in the results as the survey on
industrial producer prices was carried out with the reporting date
February 15.

Energy prices surged 68.0 percent annually in February. Excluding
energy, producer price inflation was 12.4 percent.

Data showed that intermediate goods prices were up 21.0 percent.
Producer prices of non-durable consumer goods and durable consumer goods
grew 7.5 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively. Capital goods prices
moved up 5.5 percent.
