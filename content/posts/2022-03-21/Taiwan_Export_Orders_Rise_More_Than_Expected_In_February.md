Taiwan's export orders increased more than expected in February, data
from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Monday.

Export orders rose 21.1 percent year-on-year in February. Economists had
expected a 12.8 percent growth.

Orders for mineral products surged 70.5 percent yearly in February and
those for electronic products gained 31.6 percent. Bookings for
information and communication products and chemicals increased by 29.7
percent and 22.1 percent, respectively.

Bookings for basic metals and articles thereof rose 16.1 percent and
those for textile products grew by 14.5 percent. Orders for electrical
machinery products and others gained by 4.0 percent and 2.6 percent,
respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, export orders declined 12.4 percent in
February, due to decline in demand mainly for transport equipment,
minerals, machinery and electrical machinery.
