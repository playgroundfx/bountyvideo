Egypt's central bank raised its key interest rates by 100 basis points
citing increased domestic inflationary pressures as well as external
imbalances.

At its special meeting on Monday, the Monetary Policy Committee of the
Central Bank of Egypt raised its overnight deposit rate to 9.25 percent
and the overnight lending rate to 10.25 percent.

The rate of the main operation was lifted to 9.75 percent. The discount
rate was also raised by 100 basis points to 9.75 percent.

The central bank said inflationary pressures became amplified with the
recent Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Rising international commodity prices resulting from further supply
chain disruptions in addition to increased risk-off sentiment have added
to domestic inflationary pressures as well as external imbalances.

Further, the central bank stressed on the importance of the exchange
rate flexibility to act as a shock absorber to preserve Egypt's
competitiveness.

The MPC reiterated that the path of future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates remains a
function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation
rates.

The bank said it will continue to closely monitor all economic
developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to
achieve its price stability mandate over the medium term.
