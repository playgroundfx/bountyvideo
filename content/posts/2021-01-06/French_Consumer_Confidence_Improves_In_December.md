French consumer confidence strengthened notably in December, monthly
survey results from the statistical office Insee showed Wednesday.

The consumer sentiment index rose more-than-expected to 95 in December
from 89 in November. The expected reading was 91.

The households' opinion balance related to their future financial
situation increased sharply by nine points to -4. Meanwhile, the opinion
balance related to their past financial situation increased only two
points to -13.

The index measuring future standard of living improved sharply to -43
after falling in October and November, while the assessment about the
past living standard remained unchanged in December.

The share of households considering it is a suitable time to make major
purchases increased very sharply, with the indicator climbing fifteen
points to -13. The score exceeded its long-term average, for the first
time since February 2020.

Further, the survey showed that households' fears about the unemployment
trend decreased significantly in December. The corresponding balance
lost nine points to 68.

At the same time, households considering that prices will be on the rise
over the next twelve months have been significantly less numerous than
in November, with the index falling to -29 from -22. The survey was
conducted between November 25 and December 15.
