The services sector in China continued to expand in December, albeit at
a slower pace, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Wednesday with a
services PMI score of 56.3.

That's down from 57.8 in November, although it remains well above the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, the softer rise in overall activity coincided with a
slower expansion of total new work at the end of 2020. Although rising
solidly overall, the latest increase in new [business][1] was the least
marked since September.

The slowdown occurred alongside a weaker upturn in foreign demand.
Export sales rose modestly overall, after expanding at the quickest rate
for over a year-and-a-half in November. Panel members indicated that the
pandemic, and the recent resurgence of the virus in key export
[markets][2], continued to limit growth of overseas business.

The survey also showed that its composite index fell to 55.8 in December
from 57.5 in November.
