Ireland's service sector activity increased slightly in December, after
a slump in the previous month, survey data from IHS Markit showed on
Wednesday.

The AIB Ireland services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.1 in
December from 45.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates contraction
in the sector.

Outstanding [business][1] rose for the second straight month in
December, while new business declined due to the ongoing Covid-19
restrictions.

The 12-month outlook strengthened to its highest level since February,
as firms expected vaccine development to allow for a return to normal
business conditions. Employment expanded in December.

On the price front, input prices rose for the sixth straight month in
December and the rate of inflation eased to the lowest in five months.
Prices charged by the service providers increased for the third time in
four months.

Private sector output, covering manufacturing and services, accelerated
in December. The composite output index surged to 53.4 in December from
47.7 in November.
