The private sector in Hong Kong fell deep into contraction territory in
December, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday
with a PMI score of 43.5.

That's down sharply from 50.1 in November, and it drops well beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders both fell at the sharpest rates
since April as the COVID-19 restrictions dampened demand, curbed
[business][1] activity and hit supply chains.

Exports, including new business inflows from mainland China, fell at a
markedly increased rate during the month, exacerbating a worsening of
domestic demand.
