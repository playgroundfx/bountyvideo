With the impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic on the labor market
intensifying, payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday
showing an unexpected drop in private sector employment in the U.S. in
the month of December.

ADP said private sector employment fell by 123,000 jobs in December
after jumping by a downwardly revised 304,000 jobs in November.

The decrease surprised economists, who had expected employment to climb
by about 88,000 jobs compared to the addition of 307,000 jobs originally
reported for the previous month.
