The minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
showed there was some discussion about weighting the central bank's
purchases of Treasury securities toward longer maturities.

A statement released after the mid-December meeting revealed the Fed
plans to continue purchasing bonds at a rate of at least $120 billion
per month until "substantial further progress" has been made toward its
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) goals.

The minutes revealed the meeting included conversations about how the
Fed would determine whether "substantial further progress" had been
made.

The Fed said participants commented that the judgment would be broad,
qualitative, and not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds.

Some participants drew attention to the importance of the Fed clearly
communicating its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its
longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged
substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases.

Regarding the pace and composition of the asset purchases, the Fed said
all participants agreed to continue the purchases at the current pace
and nearly all favored the current composition.

However, a couple of participants indicated that they were open to
weighting purchases of Treasury securities toward longer maturities.

The minutes said some participants noted that the Fed could increase the
pace of purchases or weight purchases toward longer maturities in the
future if the situation called for the adjustments.

Looking ahead toward the potential end of the asset purchase program, a
number of participants said the Fed should gradually taper its
purchases.

At the meeting, the Fed decided to keep the target range for the federal
funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent, which is where the target range has
remained since an emergency rate cut in March.

The accompanying statement reiterated that the Fed plans to keep rates
at near-zero levels until labor market conditions have reached levels
consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent
and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
