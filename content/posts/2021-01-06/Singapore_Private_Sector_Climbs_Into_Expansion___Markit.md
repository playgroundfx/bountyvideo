The private sector in Singapore moved into expansion territory in
December, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday
with a PMI score of 50.5.

That's up from 46.7 in November, and it moves above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new orders increased for the first times since January
with respondents mentioning stronger demand, a rise in e-commerce sales
and promotional activity.

New orders from oversea [markets][1] also rose, and at the strongest
rate since November 2018. Subsequently, firms raised output during
December, which rebounded from November's relatively solid contraction.
