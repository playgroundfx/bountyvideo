The services sector in Japan continued to contract in December, and at a
faster rate, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on Wednesday
with a services PMI score of 47.7.

That's down slightly from 47.8 in November and it moves further beneath
the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, there were sustained reductions in output and new
[business][1], although employment levels broadly stabilized and
sentiment remained positive.

Average cost burdens faced by Japanese service providers ended a four-
month sequence of falls with a marginal increase in input prices in the
latest survey period.

The survey also showed that its composite index improved to 48.5 in
December from 48.1 in November.
