Finland's consumer price inflation eased in August, data from Statistics
Finland showed on Monday.

The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent year-on-year in August, after
a 0.6 percent increase in July.

Prices of cigarettes, refundable prescription medicines, games of chance
and wireless telephone services were higher from a year ago.

However, the increase was curbed most by reductions in prices of hotel
rooms, fuels and international flights, and average interest rate on
housing loans, the statistical office said.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices remained unchanged in August,
after a 0.35 percent rise in the previous month.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, remained
unchanged monthly and rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in August.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the retail sales
turnover rose by a working day adjusted 1.1 percent annually in July
after 1.6 percent fall in June.

At the same time, the retail sales volume increased 2.8 percent annually
in July.

In [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) consumer goods trade, the working day adjusted turnover
increased 5.2 percent in July and the sales volume rose 2.6 percent from
the corresponding period of the previous year.
