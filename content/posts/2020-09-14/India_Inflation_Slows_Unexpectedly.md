India's consumer price inflation slowed slightly in August, defying
expectations for a modest acceleration, figures from the statistical
office showed on Monday.  
  
The consumer price index rose 6.69 percent year-on-year following a 6.73
percent increase in July. Economists had forecast 6.85 percent
inflation.  
  
The food price inflation eased to 9.05 percent from 9.27 percent.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the CPI rose 0.52 percent and the food
price index climbed 0.70 percent in August.  
  
As various pandemic related restrictions were gradually lifted and
nonessential activities started resuming operations, availability of
price data has also improved, the statistical office said.
