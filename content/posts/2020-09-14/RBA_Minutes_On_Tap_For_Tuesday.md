The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Monday release the minutes from
its September 1 monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, highlighting a modest day for
Asia-Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the RBA held the country's benchmark lending rate steady
at the record low 0.25 percent but increased the size of the Term
Funding Facility. Under the expanded Term Funding Facility, authorized
deposit-taking institutions will have access to additional funding,
equivalent to 2 percent of their outstanding credit, at a fixed rate of
25 basis points for three years.

Australia also will see Q2 numbers for house prices; in the three months
prior, house prices were up 1.6 percent on quarter and 7.4 percent on
year.

China will release August figures for industrial production, retail
sales, fixed asset investment and unemployment.

Industrial production is tipped to rise 5.1 percent on year, up from 4.8
percent in July. Retail sales are expected to add an annual 0.1 percent
after slipping 1.1 percent in the previous month. FAI is expected to
sink 0.4 percent on year after losing 1.6 percent a month earlier. The
jobless rate in July was 5.7 percent.

Indonesia will provide Q2 numbers for [business][1] confidence and
August trade data. In the first quarter, the business confidence index
had a score of 102.90. In July, imports were down 32.55 percent on year
and exports dropped 9.9 percent for a trade surplus of $3.26 billion.
