Ireland's construction sector deteriorated for the first time in three
months in August, data from the IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 44.0 in
August from 53.2 in July. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in
the sector.

"Following two months of post-lockdown increases in activity in June and
July, respondents reported that overall activity slipped back into
contraction territory last month, albeit that the pace of contraction
was nowhere near as severe as during the peak of the crisis in April and
May," Ulster Bank's Chief Economist for Ireland Simon Barry said.  
"High levels of market uncertainty linked to the effects of the pandemic
and some recent signs of a cooling in the wider [economy][1]'s recovery
momentum weighed on the August results, including in relation to
sentiment about the sector's future prospects," Barry said.

All three categories of activity decreased in August. Commercial
activity and housing activity declined sharply, while civil engineering
activity contracted at a softer pace.

New orders declined in the August due to the market uncertainty as a
result of COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

Purchasing activity declined modestly for the fist time in three months
in August, while suppliers' delivery time lengthened further, albeit at
a softer pace.

Input cost increased for the fourth straight month in August, but the
rate of inflation eased than series average.
