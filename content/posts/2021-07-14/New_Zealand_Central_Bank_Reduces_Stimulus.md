New Zealand central bank decided to reduce the current stimulatory level
of monetary settings.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said on
Wednesday that it will halt additional asset purchases under the Large
Scale Asset Purchase programme by July 23.

The committee decided to hold the official interest rate at 0.25 percent
and the Funding for Lending Programme unchanged.

Policymakers observed that the [economy][1] remains robust despite the
ongoing impact from international border restrictions.

In the absence of any further significant economic shocks, more
persistent consumer price inflation pressure is expected to build over
time due to rising domestic capacity pressures and growing labor
shortages.
