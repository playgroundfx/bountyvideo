Continuing to downplay the risks of inflation, Federal Reserve Chair
Jerome Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee
on Wednesday seemed to suggest the central bank is not likely to begin
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) anytime soon.

Powell told the committee in prepared remarks that "substantial further
progress" towards the Fed's goals of maximum employment and price
stability is "still a ways off."

The Fed said following its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting last month that it
will continue its bond purchases at a rate of at least $120 billion per
month until "substantial further progress" has been made toward its
goals.

Powell also once again stressed that the Fed will provide "advance
notice" before announcing any changes to its asset purchase program.

The central bank's reluctance to begin tapering its asset purchases
comes even though Powell acknowledged that inflation has increased
notably and will likely remain elevated in the coming months.

Powell argued that inflation is being temporarily boosted by base
effects as well as production bottlenecks and other supply constraints
in certain sectors.

Predicting the rapid price increases will partially reverse as the
effects of the bottlenecks unwind, Powell said inflation would
eventually moderate.

Powell also pointed to continued improvement in labor market conditions
but said "there is still a long way to go."

The Fed Chief noted the unemployment rate remained elevated at 5.9
percent in June and suggested that figure understates the shortfall in
employment, as labor market participation has not yet recovered.

Meanwhile, Powell said ongoing Covid vaccinations led to a reopening of
the [economy][1] and strong economic growth in the first half and noted
real GDP growth this year is on track to be the strongest in decades.

"There was little in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) testimony to suggest that officials are changing their tune that
the current surge in inflation will be largely transitory," said Andrew
Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "Although we expect higher inflation to prove more persistent,
our below-consensus forecasts for real economic growth mean that we
don't expect the Fed to be in any rush to start tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)."

Powell is scheduled to appear before a virtual House Financial Services
Committee hearing at 12 pm ET, with his prepared remarks due to be
followed by a question-and-answer session.

At 9:30 am ET on Thursday, Powell is due to appear before the Senate
Banking Committee, where he is likely to reiterate his prepared remarks.
