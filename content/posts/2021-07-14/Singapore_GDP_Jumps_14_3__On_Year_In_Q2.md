Singapore's gross domestic product was up 14.3 percent on year in the
second quarter of 2021, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in
Wednesday's advance estimate.

That beat forecasts for an increase of 14.2 percent and was up sharply
from the 1.3 percent gain in the previous three months.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP contracted 2.0 percent
after expanding 3.1 percent in the three months prior.

For all of 2020, GDP was down 5.4 percent both on quarter and on year.
