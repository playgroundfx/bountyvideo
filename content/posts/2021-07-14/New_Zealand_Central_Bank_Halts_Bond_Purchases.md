New Zealand central bank reduced its current monetary stimulus as the
major downside risks of deflation and high unemployment receded amid
improving economic activity.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, on
Wednesday, decided to halt additional asset purchases under the Large
Scale Asset Purchase programme by July 23.

The committee decided to hold the official interest rate at 0.25 percent
and the Funding for Lending Programme unchanged.

The Committee agreed that a 'least regrets' [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) now implied that the
significant level of monetary support in place since mid-2020 could be
reduced sooner, so as to minimize the risk of not meeting its mandate.

Policymakers observed that the [economy][1] remains robust despite the
ongoing impact from international border restrictions. Aggregate
economic activity is above its pre-COVID-19 level.

The MPC expects near-term spikes in headline CPI inflation in the June
and September quarters either due to one-off factors such as high oil
prices, or of temporary in duration, such as supply shortfalls and
higher transport costs.

In the absence of any further significant economic shocks, more
persistent consumer price inflation pressure is expected to build over
time due to rising domestic capacity pressures and growing labor
shortages.

The MPC noted that medium-term inflation and employment would likely
remain below its remit objectives in the absence of some ongoing
monetary support. However, the committee agreed that the level of
monetary stimulus could now be reduced to minimize the risk of not
meeting its mandate.

The end of asset purchases signals that interest rates will rise soon,
Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Ahead of today's meeting, [markets][2] were pricing a quarter point rate
hike by the end of this year. The economist reiterated that the RBNZ
will lift rates to 1.25 percent by 2023.
