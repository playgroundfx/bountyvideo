Turkey's central bank retained its key interest rate, as widely
expected, for the fourth straight meeting on Wednesday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to hold the key one-week
repo rate at 19.00 percent.

The bank had lifted the interest rates by 200 basis points at the March
meeting under the leadership of former governor Naci Agbal.

The bank repeatedly said that taking into account the high levels of
inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the
April Inflation Report's forecast path is achieved.

The central bank reiterated that it will continue to use decisively all
available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price
stability.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will continue to be determined at a level above
inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong
indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5
percent target is reached, the bank said.

An easing cycle is now unlikely to commence until late this year when
inflation looks set to fall sharply as the effects of previous falls in
the lira start to unwind, Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

The bank forecast one-week repo rate to end this year at 17.00 percent
and to be lowered to 12.00 percent by end-2022.
