Consumer confidence in Australia remains firm in July, the latest survey
from Westpac Bank showed on Wednesday as its sentiment index gained 1.5
percent to a score of 108.8 - up from 107.2 in June.

Confidence has held up overall despite a sharp fall in NSW as other
states - notably Victoria and Western Australia - recorded strong
bounce-backs from COVID-related disruptions in June.

The main takeaway is that concerns around the current virus outbreak and
associated restrictions in NSW are not spilling over to the rest of the
country. This contrasts with Victoria's 'second wave' outbreak in August
last year which weighed heavily on sentiment across the rest of the
country.

The modest sentiment increase in July follows a 9.8 percent fall in the
Index over the previous two months (April to June). That fall centered
on weakness in Victoria (down 16 percent) and Western Australia (down 18
percent) with both states experiencing intermittent lock-downs as their
governments sought to contain a lift in COVID cases.
