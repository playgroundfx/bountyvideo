Amid ongoing Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome
Powell on Wednesday, the central bank also released its Beige Book, a
compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic conditions in each of the
twelve Fed districts.

The Beige Book noted the U.S. [economy][1] strengthened further from
late May to early July, with the pace of growth described as moderate to
robust.

The transportation, travel and tourism, manufacturing, and non-financial
services sectors reported above-average growth, while energy
[markets][2] improved slightly, and agriculture had mixed results.

The report said supply-side disruptions became more widespread during
the period, including shortages of materials and labor, delivery delays,
and low inventories of many consumer goods.

Powell told the House Financial Services Committee that production
bottlenecks and other supply constraints in certain sectors have
contributed to a notable increase in inflation, with the Beige Book
noting prices have increased at an above-average pace.

The Beige Book described pricing pressures as broad-based, with more
acute pricing pressures seen in the hospitality sector, as the reopening
of hotels and restaurants confronted limited supplies of materials and
workers.

"While some [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s felt that pricing pressures were transitory, the
majority expected further increases in input costs and selling prices in
the coming months," the Fed said.

The report also said three-quarters of the Fed districts reported either
slight or modest job gains, while the remainder reported moderate or
strong increases in employment.

Labor shortages were often cited as a reason firms could not staff at
desired levels, the Beige Book said, with firms in several districts
expecting the difficulty finding workers to extend into the early fall.

Looking ahead, the Beige Book said the outlook for demand continued to
improve but noted many [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s expressed uncertainty or pessimism over
the easing of supply constraints.

The release of the Beige Book comes two weeks ahead of the Fed's next
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, which is scheduled for July 27-28.
