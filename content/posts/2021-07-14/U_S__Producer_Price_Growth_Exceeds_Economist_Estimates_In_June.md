After yesterday's report showing the biggest increase in U.S. consumer
prices in thirteen years, the Labor Department released a report on
Wednesday showing U.S. producer prices also jumped by much more than
expected in the month of June.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
surged up by 1.0 percent in June after climbing by 0.8 percent in May.
Economists had expected producer prices to rise by 0.6 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in producer prices was largely due to
an advance in prices for services, which accounted for nearly 60 percent
of the jump by the headline index.

Prices for final demand services climbed by 0.8 percent in June, as
prices for trade services spiked by 2.1 percent and prices for
transportation and warehousing services increased by 0.9 percent.

Excluding prices for food, energy, and trade services, core producer
prices increased by 0.5 percent in June following a 0.7 percent advance
in the previous month.

The report also showed the annual rate of producer price growth
accelerated to 7.3 percent in June from 6.6 percent in May, reaching the
highest level since 12-month data were first calculated in November of
2010.

Core producer prices were up by 5.5 percent year-over-year in June,
reflecting an uptick from the 5.3 percent jump in May.

The annual surge in core prices also reflected the largest advance since
12-month data were first calculated in August of 2014.

"We believe this will be the peak in the pace of wholesale inflation as
base effects ease," said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

"But ongoing friction between supply and demand will continue to keep
prices sticky through 2021 and into 2022," he added. "This supports our
call that the Fed will begin QE tapering in early 2022."

On Tuesday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
consumer prices saw the biggest monthly increase in thirteen years in
the month of June.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index jumped by 0.9 percent
in June after climbing by 0.6 percent in May. Economists had expected
consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in consumer prices reflected the
biggest advance since prices surged up by 1.0 percent in June of 2008.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices still jumped by
0.9 percent in June following a 0.7 percent increase in May. Core prices
were expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

The annual rate of consumer price growth accelerated to 5.4 percent in
June from 5 percent in May, reaching the highest level since a matching
spike in August of 2008.

Core consumer prices were up by 4.5 percent year-over-year in June,
reflecting an acceleration from the 3.8 percent jump in May. Core prices
saw the biggest annual increase since November of 1991.
