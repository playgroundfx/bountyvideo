Brazil's consumer confidence eroded sharply in April to reach its record
low in its 15-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), as households became very pessimistic about
future amid the outbreak of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic.  
  
The consumer confidence index shed 22 points to hit 58.2, the lowest
since the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) series began in September 2005, survey data from
the think tank FGV showed on Monday. The previous low was 64.9 reached
in December 2015.  
  
Consumers were increasingly pessimistic regarding economic situation of
the country and also about their own financial conditions amid the virus
outbreak and the consequent containment measures adopted.  
  
Downbeat sentiment spread among the different income classes and most
households tightened consumption. They spending only on essential goods
and services.  
  
"It is still difficult to see a significant improvement in the next
months, given the high level of economic and political uncertainty,"
Viviane Bittencourt, survey coordinator at FGV IBRE, said.
