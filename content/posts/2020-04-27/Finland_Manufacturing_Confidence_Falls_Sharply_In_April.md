Covid-19 pandemic hurt expectations, survey data from the Confederation
of Finnish Industries showed on Monday.

March. The reading was well below its long-term average of +1.

Manufacturers expect production to fall severely in near future.

The construction confidence indicator decreased 25 points to -28 in
April. This was below its long-term average of -6.

The service sector confidence indicator dropped forty-two points to -48
in April. This was far below the long-term average of +13.

The retail trade confidence declined to -37 in April from -16 in March,
well below its long term average of -1.
