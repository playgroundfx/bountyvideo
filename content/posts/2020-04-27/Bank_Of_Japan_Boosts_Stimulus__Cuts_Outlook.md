The Bank of Japan expanded the monetary stimulus for the second straight
meeting as it removed the limit for government bond purchases and
downgraded both its GDP and inflation projections due to the spread of
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the BoJ, on Monday, unanimously decided to increase
the maximum amount of additional purchases of commercial papers and
corporate bonds and raised the upper limit of outstanding holdings to
about JPY 20 trillion.

The bank will purchase Japanese government bonds without setting an
upper limit so that the 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero
percent. The yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly
depending on developments in economic activity and prices.

The BoJ expanded the range of collaterals that are eligible to avail the
benefits of special funding operation introduced in March. Private debt
including household debts is also eligible under the scheme.

Nonetheless, the board voted 8-1 to retain the interest rate at -0.1
percent on current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the
central bank.

The BoJ board shortened the duration of the meeting with a view to
making the utmost efforts to prevent the spread of the novel
coronavirus.

In the quarterly report, the bank said the outlook for economic activity
and prices is extremely unclear.

There are high uncertainties regarding the consequences of the spread of
Covid-19, the timing of the spread subsiding, and the magnitude of its
impact on domestic and global economies.

The central bank downgraded its GDP forecast for the fiscal 2020 to -5
percent to -3 percent from the previous projection of +0.8 percent to
+1.1 percent.

Likewise, the inflation outlook for fiscal 2020 was lowered to -0.7
percent to -0.3 percent from +1 percent to +1.1 percent.

The Japanese [economy][2] is expected to expand in the range of 2.8
percent to 3.9 percent next fiscal year and 0.8 percent to 1.6 percent
in the fiscal 2022.

Inflation is forecast to average zero to 0.7 percent in the fiscal 2021
and 0.4 percent to 1 percent in the fiscal 2022. Accordingly, the bank
is unlikely to achieve its 2 percent inflation at least until 2022.

The board did not cut the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate even though all members expect a
slump in activity, Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics,
said. "With our forecasts not miles away from the Bank's, the chances of
a rate cut are dwindling."
