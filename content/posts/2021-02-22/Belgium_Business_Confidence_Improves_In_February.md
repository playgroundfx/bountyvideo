Belgium's [business][1] confidence rose in February, boosted by
improvements in all sectors, survey data from the National Bank of
Belgium showed Monday.  
  
The business confidence index climbed to -4.4 from -7.5 in January.  
  
Morale improved strongly in the business services and trade sectors on
more positive assessment of the demand outlook.  
  
The corresponding indexes rose by more than 6 percentage points.

The index for the construction sector rose about 6 percentage points on
favorable assessments of order books and the outlook for business
activity.  
  
Confidence strengthened modestly in the manufacturing sectors as more
companies assessed their stock levels higher than normal.
