Hong Kong's consumer prices rose for the first time in seven months in
January, data from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Monday.

The composite consumer price index rose 1.9 percent year-on-year in
January, after a 0.7 percent fall in December.

Excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, the
composite consumer price index decreased 0.5 percent yearly in January,
after remaining unchanged in the previous month.

"Looking ahead, price pressures from both external and domestic fronts
should remain mild in the near term as global and local economic
activities have yet to return to the pre-recession levels, a government
spokesman said.
