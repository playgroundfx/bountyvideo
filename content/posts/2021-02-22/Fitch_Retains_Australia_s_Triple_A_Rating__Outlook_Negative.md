Fitch Ratings maintained Australia's sovereign ratings at 'AAA' citing
strong institutions and effective [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework.

However, Fitch said the 'negative' outlook on ratings reflects
uncertainty around the medium-term debt trajectory following the
significant rise in public debt/GDP caused by the response to the
pandemic.

The [economy][1] is estimated to shrink 2.8 percent in 2020 compared to
'AAA' median contraction of 3.8 percent. The economy is projected to
expand by 3.8 percent in 2021 and 2.7 percent in 2022.

The effective fiscal and monetary response has helped the economy to
withstand the economic shock caused by the pandemic, the agency
observed.

Due to government's fiscal stimulus measures, the general government
deficit is expected to widen to 12.7 percent of GDP in the fiscal year
ending June 2021. The general government deficit is forecast to fall to
a still-high 6.4 percent of GDP in FY22, Fitch said.
