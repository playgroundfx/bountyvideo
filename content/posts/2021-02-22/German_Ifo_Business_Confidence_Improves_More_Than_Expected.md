Germany's [business][1] confidence strengthened more-than-expected in
February as the manufacturing activity remained robust despite the
lockdown, survey results from ifo Institute revealed on Monday.

The business confidence index rose to 92.4 from revised 90.3 in the
previous month. This was better than the economists' forecast of 90.5.

The increase in the Ifo Business Climate Index in February suggests that
the German [economy][2] is weathering the lockdown better than
anticipated, Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The largest euro area economy is likely to regain its pre-pandemic level
in early 2022, well ahead of the other major euro-zone economies, the
economist added.

Assessments of the current business situation were more positive.
Moreover, pessimism regarding the coming months was markedly reduced in
February.

The current conditions indicator came in at 90.6 in February, up from
89.2 the previous month and above economists' forecast of 89.0.

The business expectations indicator improved to 94.2 from 91.5 a month
ago. Economists had forecast the score to rise moderately to 91.8.

In manufacturing, the business climate index jumped to its highest value
since November 2018. Assessments of the current situation improved and
companies were notably more optimistic about the coming months.

Business confidence in the service sector also improved in February.
Service providers were more satisfied with their current situation and
their business expectations were less pessimistic.

In trade, the business climate index rose a little following last
month's slump. Expectations were still pessimistic, but not to the same
degree as last month. On the other hand, companies' assessments of their
current situation were worse.

The business climate improved in construction due to less pessimistic
expectations in February.
