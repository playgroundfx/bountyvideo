Economic activity in the U.S. has recently grown at a modest to moderate
rate, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, although the pace
of growth has slowed.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in each of the twelve Fed districts, attributed the slowdown
to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and uncertainty around the
Delta variant of COVID-19.

The report said a majority of Fed districts indicated positive growth in
consumer spending, although auto sales were widely reported as declining
due to low inventory levels and rising prices.

Manufacturing grew moderately to robustly in most parts of the country,
the Beige Book said, while growth in non-manufacturing activity ranged
from slight to moderate for most districts.

The Fed also said employment increased at a modest to moderate rate in
recent weeks, as demand for workers was high, but labor growth was
dampened by a low supply of workers.

On the inflation front, the Beige Book said most districts reported
significantly elevated prices, fueled by rising demand for goods and raw
materials.

Reports of input cost increases were widespread across industry sectors,
driven by product scarcity resulting from supply chain bottlenecks, the
Fed said.

Looking ahead, the report said outlooks for near-term economic activity
remained positive, but some districts noted increased uncertainty and
more cautious optimism than in previous months.

The Beige Book is typically released about two weeks before the Fed's
next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, which is scheduled for November 2nd and
3rd.

The Fed has recently indicated it could announce plans to begin scaling
back its asset purchases following the meeting.
