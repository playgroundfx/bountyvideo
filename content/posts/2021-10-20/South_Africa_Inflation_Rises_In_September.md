goods and services.

annually in September and housing and utilities cost rose by 4.0
percent.

Prices of miscellaneous goods and services, and transport grew by 4.0
percent and 10.1 percent, respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer price grew 0.2 percent in September.
Economists had forecast a 0.3 percent rise.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.2 percent in September. Economists had forecast
a 3.1 percent increase.

On a monthly basis, core CPI rose 0.3 percent in September. Economists
