South Africa's producer price inflation rose to the highest in six
months in September, figures from Statistics South Africa showed on
Thursday.

The producer price index rose 2.5 percent year-on-year in September,
following a 2.4 percent increase in August. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

Prices rose at the fastest pace since March, when it was 3.3 percent.

The main contribution for the increase in prices came from food
products, beverages and tobacco products, and transport equipment in
September.

Producer prices for mining industry grew 36.4 percent annually in
October and prices for electricity and water increased 4.3 percent.

Prices for agriculture, forestry and fishing, and intermediate goods
rose by 8.1 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices increased 0.3 percent in September,
in line with economists' expectation.
