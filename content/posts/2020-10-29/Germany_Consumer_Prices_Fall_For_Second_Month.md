Germany's consumer prices declined for the second straight month in
October largely due to the reduction in the value added tax, preliminary
data from Destatis showed on Thursday.

Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent on year, the same rate of decrease as
seen in September. Economists had forecast an annual decrease of 0.3
percent.

Month-on-month, the consumer price index edged up 0.1 percent, in
contrast to a 0.1 percent fall economists' had forecast. Prices had
decreased 0.2 percent in September.

The harmonized index of consumer prices slid 0.5 percent annually,
following a 0.4 percent drop in the previous month. Prices were expected
to drop again by 0.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, the HICP remained unchanged in October versus the
expected rise of 0.1 percent. Final data is due on November 12.

Eurozone consumer price data is due on October 30. Consumer prices in
the currency bloc are forecast to drop 0.3 percent on year in October.
