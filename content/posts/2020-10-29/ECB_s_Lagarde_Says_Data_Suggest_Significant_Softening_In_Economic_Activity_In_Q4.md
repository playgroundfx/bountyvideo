European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday hinted at
a move by the central bank in December as the risks are clearly tilted
to the downside due to a resurgence in the [coronavirus][1] infections
that is going to significantly hurt economic activity in the euro area
in the fourth quarter of this year.

"Incoming information signals that the euro area economic recovery is
losing momentum more rapidly than expected, after a strong, yet partial
and uneven, rebound in economic activity over the summer months,"
Lagarde said in her introductory statement during the post decision
press conference.

"The rise in COVID-19 cases and the associated intensification of
containment measures is weighing on activity, constituting a clear
deterioration in the near-term outlook."

Earlier on Thursday, the bank left its interest rates and stimulus
measures unchanged and signaled that the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers will "reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)te"
measures in December when the latest set of ECB staff macroeconomic
projections will be available.

Markets construed this wording as a clear signal that the central bank
is planning some stimulus measure for the December 10 [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session.

During the press conference, Lagarde told reporters that there was
"little doubt" that the ECB will act in December, thus adding strength
to market expectations.

She said [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers did not discuss any change to [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures this
month.

The ECB chief also said that the bank was ready to frontload Pandemic
Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) asset purchases if needed.  
  
"We think the most likely outcome of the December meeting is still an
increase of asset purchases, via both the PSPP but also the PEPP
programme, by some 500 billion euro and more, possibly even more tailor-
madeÂ support for banks and bank lending," ING economist Carsten Brzeski
said.

A new wave of coronavirus infections in Eurozone has raised the prospect
of further disruption to economic activity and normal life. On Thursday,
Germany and France announced lockdowns.

Eurostat is set to release the preliminary estimates for Eurozone gross
domestic product on Friday. Economists are looking for a significant
rebound with 9.4 percent increase in economic output.  
  
Lagarde pointed to a visible weakening in the services sector due to the
lockdown restrictions, and caution among consumers in the backdrop of
uncertain outlook for employment and earnings.

She also said that low energy prices and muted underlying price
pressures, due to weak demand and significant slack in labor and product
[markets][2], is dampening headline inflation.

Lagarde reconfirmed ECB's accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance and
forward guidance.
