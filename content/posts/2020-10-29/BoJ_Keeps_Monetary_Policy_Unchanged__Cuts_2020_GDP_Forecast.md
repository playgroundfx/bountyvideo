Japan's central bank maintained its massive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing as
widely expected, but downgraded its GDP projection for the current
fiscal year, citing a delay in recovery in services demand.

The Policy Board of the BoJ governed by Haruhiko Kuroda voted 8-1 to
retain the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that
financial institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The bank will actively buy exchange-traded funds and Japan real estate
investment trusts so that their outstanding amounts will increase at
annual paces with the upper limit of about JPY 12 trillion and around
JPY 180 billion, respectively.

As for CP and corporate bonds, the bank will maintain their outstanding
amounts at about JPY 2 trillion and JPY 3 trillion, respectively.

The bank said that the [economy][1] is likely to follow an improving
trend with economic activity resuming and the impact of the coronavirus
waning gradually. But the pace is forecast to be moderate.

The economy is forecast to shrink 5.5 percent in the fiscal 2020, weaker
than the previous outlook of -4.7 percent. Overall consumer prices are
expected to drop 0.6 percent versus a 0.5 percent fall projected in
July.

The growth outlook for fiscal 2021 was raised to 3.6 percent from 3.3
percent and that for 2022 to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent.

Consumer prices are projected to rise 0.4 percent in the fiscal 2021
compared to the previous outlook of 0.3 percent. At the same time, the
inflation outlook for the fiscal 2022 was retained at 0.7 percent.

The bank said the outlook for both economic activity and prices is
extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences
of Covid-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas
economies.
