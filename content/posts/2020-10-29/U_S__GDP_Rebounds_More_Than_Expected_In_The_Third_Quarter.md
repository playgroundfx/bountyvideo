After reporting a record contraction in U.S. economic activity in the
previous quarter, the Commerce Department released a report on Thursday
showing the [economy][1] rebounded by more than expected in the third
quarter.

The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product skyrocketed by
33.1 percent in the third quarter after plunging by 31.4 percent in the
second quarter. Economists had expected GDP to soar by 31.0 percent.

The substantial rebound in GDP came as consumer spending bounced back
sharply, spiking by 40.7 percent in the third quarter after plummeting
by 33.2 percent in the second quarter.

Increases in private inventory investment, exports, non-residential
fixed investment, and residential fixed investment also contributed to
the rebound.

The positive contributions to GDP were partly offset by decreases in
federal government spending and state and local government spending as
well as an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the
calculation of GDP.

"Overall, the initial recovery in GDP after the first wave of lockdowns
were lifted was stronger than we originally anticipated," said Paul
Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "But, with [coronavirus][2] infections hitting a record high
in recent days and any additional fiscal stimulus unlikely to arrive
until, at the earliest, the start of next year, further progress will be
much slower."

On the inflation front, the report said core consumer prices, which
exclude food and energy prices, jumped by 3.5 percent in the third
quarter following a 0.8 percent drop in the second quarter.
