Pending home sales unexpectedly pulled back off a record high in the
month of September, according to a report released by the National
Association of Realtors on Thursday.

NAR said its pending home sales index slumped by 2.2 percent to 130.0 in
September after spiking by 8.8 percent to 132.9 in August. The drop came
as a surprise to economists, who had expected pending home sales to jump
by another 3.4 percent.

Despite the unexpected monthly decrease, pending home sales in September
were up by 20.5 percent compared to the same month a year ago.

A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet
closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale.

"The demand for home buying remains super strong, even with a slight
monthly pullback in September, and we're still likely to end the year
with more homes sold overall in 2020 than in 2019," said NAR chief
economist Lawrence Yun.

He added, "With persistent low mortgage rates and some degree of a
continuing jobs recovery, more contract signings are expected in the
near future."

The unexpected drop in pending home sales came as three of four regional
indices recorded decreases in contract activity on a month-over-month
basis in September.

Pending home sales fell by 3.2 percent in the Midwest, 3.0 percent in
the South and 2.6 percent in the West, while pending home sales in the
Northeast rose by 2.0 percent.
