Dutch producer confidence decreased in October, data from the Central
Bureau of Statistics showed on Thursday.

The producer sentiment index fell to -5.6 in October from -4.8 in
September. This was below the average score of 0.3 seen over the past
twenty years.

Producers were less negative about the order book and their assessment
of stocks of finished products was more positive, the agency said.

However, there were more entrepreneurs who expected their production to
decrease in the coming three months, the agency said.

Producers in the wood and building material industry were more positive.
