After reporting a record contraction in U.S. economic activity in the
previous quarter, the Commerce Department released a report on Thursday
showing the [economy][1] rebounded by more than expected in the third
quarter.

The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product skyrocketed by
33.1 percent in the third quarter after plunging by 31.4 percent in the
second quarter. Economists had expected GDP to soar by 31.0 percent.

The substantial rebound in GDP reflected increases in consumer spending,
private inventory investment, exports, non-residential fixed investment,
and residential fixed investment.
