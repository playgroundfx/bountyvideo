European Central Bank left its key interest rates and massive stimulus
unchanged on Thursday, citing a highly uncertain outlook amid a
resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic, and hinted at a move in December
when the latest set of macroeconomic projections will be available.  
  
The Governing Council, led by ECB President Christine Lagarde, left the
main refi rate unchanged at a record low zero percent and the deposit
rate was kept at -0.50 percent, in line with economists' expectations.
The lending rate was left unchanged at 0.25 percent.  
  
The bank made changes to its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) statement this time and had a fresh
introductory paragraph.

Policymakers will carefully assess the incoming information, including
the dynamics of the pandemic, prospects for a roll-out of vaccines and
developments in the euro exchange rate as the risks remain clearly
tilted to the downside, the bank said.  
  
"The new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in December
will allow a thorough reassessment of the economic outlook and the
balance of risks," the ECB said.  
  
"On the basis of this updated assessment, the Governing Council will
reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)te its instruments, as appropriate, to respond to the unfolding
situation and to ensure that financing conditions remain favorable to
support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the
pandemic on the projected inflation path."

A new wave of [coronavirus][1] infections in the euro area has raised
the prospect of further disruption to economic activity and normal life.
On Thursday, Germany and France announced lockdowns.  
  
"The door for December action is wide open," ING economist Carsten
Brzeski said.  
  
"Let's hope that the situation doesn't worsen further so that the ECB
has to rush through the door earlier than planned."

Reiterating its forward guidance on interest rates, the bank said it
expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower
levels until the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level
sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within its projection
horizon.  
  
The size of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) was left
unchanged at EUR 1,350 billion.

The ECB retained the forward guidance on its stimulus measures such as
asset purchases and lending operations.  
  
Asset purchases under the PEPP will continue until at least the end of
June 2021 or when [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assess that the coronavirus crisis is
over, the ECB said.  
  
The future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid
interference with the appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, the central
bank added.  
  
Further, the bank said the net purchases under the asset purchase
programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion,
together with the purchases under the additional EUR 120 billion
temporary envelope until the end of the year.  
  
Policymakers continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the
APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative
impact of its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates, and to end shortly before they start raising
the key ECB interest rates.  
  
The Governing Council will also continue to provide ample liquidity
through its refinancing operations, the bank said.
