Eurozone economic confidence stagnated in October as weaker sentiment in
the services sector and among consumers was offset by a recovery of
morale in industry, retail trade and construction.

The economic confidence index held steady at 90.9 in October, survey
results from European Commission showed on Thursday. The score was
forecast to ease to 89.5.

The industrial confidence index advanced to -9.6 from -11.4 a month ago.
This was the sixth consecutive rise. The improvement was driven by
managers' appraisals of the current level of overall order books and
benign views on the adequacy of the stocks of finished products.

However, the services sentiment index fell to -11.8 from -11.2 largely
due to the deterioration of managers' demand expectations.

As households reported growing concerns about the expected general
economic situation and their expected financial situation, the consumer
confidence index declined to -15.5 from -13.9. The score matched
preliminary estimate.

The retail trade sentiment rose to -6.9 from -8.6 in the previous month,
thanks to brightening assessments of the past [business][1] situation
and the adequacy of the volume of stocks.

The confidence index in construction came in at -8.4 versus -9.5 in
September. The improvement was driven by the rise in employment
expectations and slightly better assessments of the level of order
books.

After five months of improving readings, the employment expectations
indicator turned negative, due to a significant decline of employment
plans in services in October.

The business confidence index rose to a seven-month high of -0.74 in
October from -1.20 a month ago.
