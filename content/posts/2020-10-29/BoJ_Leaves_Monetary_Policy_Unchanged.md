retain the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that

government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

investment trusts so that their outstanding amounts will increase at
annual paces with the upper limit of about JPY 12 trillion and around
JPY 180 billion, respectively.

As for CP and corporate bonds, the bank will maintain their outstanding
amounts at about JPY 2 trillion and JPY 3 trillion, respectively.

trend with economic activity resuming and the impact of the coronavirus
waning gradually. But the pace is forecast to be moderate.

The economy is forecast to shrink 5.5 percent in the fiscal 2020 versus
previous outlook of -4.7 percent. The growth outlook for fiscal 2021 was
raised to 3.6 percent from 3.3 percent and that for 2022 to 1.6 percent
