Norway's consumer confidence improved sharply in the second quarter,
signaling that the [economy][1] is returning to a strong growth as the
effects of the coronavirus pandemic fade.  
  
The seasonally adjusted consumer confidence rose to 2.5 from minus 3.2
in the first quarter, survey results from the financial industry body
Finance Norway showed Tuesday.

The index reading turned positive for the first time since the first
quarter of 2020, when it was 3.9.

For the first time since the [coronavirus][2] lockdown, there are now
more optimists than pessimists, and optimism is rising in almost all
groups and for all indicators, Finance Norway said.

Optimism is largely driven by a sharp increase in expectations on the
country's economy over the next year.  
  
"It is natural to interpret this as the vast majority now expect to
receive a vaccine within a few months," Finance Norway CEO Idar Kreutzer
said.

"That way, we can begin to return to a more normal life and a more
normal economy."

The unadjusted indicator climbed to 4.5 from minus 3 in the previous
quarter.  
  
The quarterly survey, a joint effort of Finance Norway and Kantar TNS,
was conducted from May 6 to 11.
