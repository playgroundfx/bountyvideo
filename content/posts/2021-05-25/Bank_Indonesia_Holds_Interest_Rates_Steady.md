Indonesia's central bank again left its key interest rates unchanged on
Tuesday, citing the improving economic outlook and the rupiah stability.  
  
The board of governors decided to hold the the BI 7-Day reverse repo
rate at 3.50 percent, the Bank Indonesia said in a statement. That was
in line with economists' expectations.  
  
The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in
February.  
  
The deposit facility rate was maintained at 2.75 percent and lending
facility rates at 4.25 percent.  
  
"The decision is consistent with projected low inflation and efforts to
maintain rupiah exchange rate stability, while accelerating the national
economic recovery," the central bank said.

Additional [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures announced by the central bank included
lowering the upper limit on credit card interest rates from 2 percent to
1.75 percent per month.

The bank retained its April projection for growth this year at 4.1-5.1
percent.  
  
The central bank said it will continue to strengthen exchange rate
stabilisation [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in line with the rupiah's fundamental value and
market mechanisms through effective monetary operations and adequate
market liquidity.

Bank Indonesia forecast a low and manageable current account deficit for
this year in the 1.0-2.0 percent of GDP range.

"We expect the central bank to keep [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates unchanged in the near
term given the likely recurring threat of rising bond yields and
depreciation pressures on the currency," ING economist Nicholas Mapa
said.

"Interestingly, Warjiyo did signal that BI could reverse course should
inflation begin to pick up but he quickly clarified that price pressures
would not likely accelerate until perhaps 2022."

ING expects the bank to roll out additional measures to bolster bank
lending via targeted initiatives to help support investment activity
without resorting to additional rate cuts.
