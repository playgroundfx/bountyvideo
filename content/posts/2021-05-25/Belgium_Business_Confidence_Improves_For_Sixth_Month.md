Belgium's consumer confidence strengthened for a sixth consecutive month
in May, led by rising optimism in the [business][1] services and
construction sectors, survey results from the National Bank of Belgium
showed Tuesday.  
  
The business confidence index rose to 6.5 from 4.4 in April.  
  
The confidence index for the business-related services sector registered
the biggest increase, jumping to 14.8 from 7.0 in the previous month.

The sharp increase was mainly due to a more positive assessment of the
outlook for general market demand and firms' own activity, while
appraisals of current activity weakened slightly.
