The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
on Wednesday and then announce its decision on interest rates,
highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The RBNZ
is widely expected to keep its Official Cash Rate unchanged at 0.25
percent.

New Zealand also will release April figures for imports, exports and
trade balance. In March, imports were worth NZ$5.65 billion and exports
were at NZ$5.68 billion for a trade surplus of NZ$33 million.

Australia will see April results for the leading economic index from
Westpac and also Q1 numbers for construction work done. The economic
index was up 0.38 percent on month in March. Construction work is
expected to gain 2.2 percent on quarter after sinking 0.9 percent in the
three months prior.

Singapore will provide Q1 numbers for current account; in the previous
three months, the current account surplus was SGD19.62 billion.

Japan will release final March figures for its leading and coincident
economic indexes; the previous scores were 98.9 and 89.9, respectively.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia are
closed on Wednesday for Vesak Day - while Thailand is also shuttered for
