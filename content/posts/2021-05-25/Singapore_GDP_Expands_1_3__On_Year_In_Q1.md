Singapore's gross domestic product gained 1.3 percent on year in the
first three months of 2021, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said on
Tuesday.

That beat expectations for an increase of 0.9 percent following the 2.4
percent contraction in the fourth quarter of 2020.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP rose 3.1 percent after
climbing 3.8 percent in the three months prior.

Upon the release of the data, the MTI maintained its GDP growth forecast
for 2021 at 4.0 to 6.0 percent.
