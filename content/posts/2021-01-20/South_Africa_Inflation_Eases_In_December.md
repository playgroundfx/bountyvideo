services.

annually in December and housing and utilities cost rose by 2.7 percent.

Prices of miscellaneous goods and services rose 7.0 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer price grew 0.2 percent in December,
in line with economists' expectation.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.3 percent in December. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

On a monthly basis, the core CPI rose 0.2 percent in December, in line
with economists' expectation.
