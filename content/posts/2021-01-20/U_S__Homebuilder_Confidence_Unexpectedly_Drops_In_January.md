Reflecting concerns about rising material costs and the resurgence of
the [coronavirus][1], the National Association of Home Builders released
a report on Wednesday showing an unexpected drop in U.S. homebuilder
confidence in the month of January.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell to 83 in
January after sliding to 86 in December. The continued decline surprised
economists, who had expected the index to come in unchanged.

With the unexpected decrease, the housing market index pulled back
further off the record high of 90 set in November.

"While housing continues to help lead the [economy][2] forward, limited
inventory is constraining more robust growth," said NAHB Chief Economist
Robert Dietz.

He added, "A shortage of buildable lots is making it difficult to meet
strong demand and rising material prices are far outpacing increases in
home prices, which in turn is harming housing affordability."

The unexpected drop by the headline index reflected decreases by all
three of the component indices, with the gauge charting traffic of
prospective buyers showing a notable decline to 68 in January from 73 in
December.

The index gauging current sales conditions and the component measuring
sales expectations in the next six months both fell by two points to 90
and 83, respectively.

"Despite robust housing demand and low mortgage rates, buyers are facing
a dearth of new homes on the market, which is exacerbating affordability
problems," said NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke.

"Builders are grappling with supply-side constraints related to lumber
and other material costs, a lack of affordable lots and labor shortages
that delay delivery times and put upward pressure on home prices," he
added. "They are also concerned about a changing regulatory
environment."

On Thursday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of December.

Housing starts are expected to rise to an annual rate of 1.560 million
in December from 1.547 million in November, while building permits are
expected to drop to a rate of 1.604 million from 1.635 million.
