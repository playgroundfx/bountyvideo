Reflecting a sharp pullback in energy prices, the Labor Department
released a report on Thursday showing only a slight uptick in U.S.
producer prices in the month of December.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
edged up by 0.2 percent in December after jumping by an upwardly revised
1.0 percent in November.

Economists had expected producer prices to rise by 0.4 percent compared
to the 0.8 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding food, energy and trade prices, core producer prices rose by
0.4 percent in December after climbing by 0.8 percent in November.

The report showed the annual rate of producer growth slowed to 9.7
percent in December from a record high 9.8 percent in November. The
yearly core price growth was unchanged at 6.9 percent.
