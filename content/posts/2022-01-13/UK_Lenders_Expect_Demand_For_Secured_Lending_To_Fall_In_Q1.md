UK lenders expect demand for secured lending to fall in the first
quarter, while that for unsecured lending is expected to improve, the
latest Credit Conditions Survey from the Bank of England showed on

purchases in the three months to end-November and it was expected to
fall again in the coming quarter.

was forecast to improve again in the coming three months. Within the
overall figure, demand for both credit card lending and other unsecured
lending increased in the fourth quarter.  
  
Lenders reported that demand for corporate lending from small businesses
decreased, demand from medium-sized businesses was unchanged, and demand
from large firms slightly increased in the fourth quarter.

households increased in the fourth quarter and expected the availability
to rise in the first quarter.

Similarly, the availability of unsecured credit to households increased
in the fourth quarter and was expected to increase in the first quarter.
