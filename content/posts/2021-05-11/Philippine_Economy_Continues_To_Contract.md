The Philippine [economy][1] continued to contract in the first quarter
as the nation imposed strict restrictions to bring the coronavirus
pandemic under control.

Gross domestic product fell 4.2 percent in the first quarter from the
last year, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported Tuesday. This
was slower than the 8.3 percent decline seen in the fourth quarter of
2020 but bigger than the 3 percent fall economists' had forecast.

GDP has fallen for the fifth straight quarter and the latest drop was
the slowest in four quarters.

On a quarterly basis, GDP grew only 0.3 percent, following a 5.6 percent
surge in the fourth quarter.

The re-imposition of strict containment measures is likely to see output
shrink this quarter, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

The weakness of the recovery is likely to prompt the central bank into
cutting rates further to support the economy, the economist noted.  
  
While elevated inflation will probably prevent the central bank from
acting at its meeting this coming Thursday, it is still likely to cut
later in the year if, inflation falls back within target, Holmes added.

On the expenditure side, household consumption shrank 4.8 percent
annually, while government final consumption expenditure surged 16.1
percent in the first quarter.

Gross capital formation decreased sharply by 18.3 percent. Exports slid
9 percent and imports were down 8.3 percent.

The production-side breakdown showed that the decline was driven by a
24.2 percent plunge in construction. Services and industry contracted
4.4 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Farm output was down 1.2
percent.
