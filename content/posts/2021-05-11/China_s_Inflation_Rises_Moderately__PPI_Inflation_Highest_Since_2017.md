China's consumer price inflation rose moderately at a slower-than-
expected pace in April, while producer prices grew at the fastest pace
in more than three years driven by higher commodity prices.

Consumer price inflation rose to 0.9 percent in April from 0.4 percent
in March, the National Bureau of Statistics reported Tuesday.
Nonetheless, the rate was slightly below economists' forecast of 1
percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices dropped 0.3 percent versus an
expected fall of 0.2 percent.

Core inflation that excludes volatile energy and food prices picked up
to 0.7 percent from 0.3 percent.

Food prices dropped 0.7 percent, while non-food prices advanced 1.3
percent.

The consumer price growth rate was capped by pork prices which were very
high last year, Iris Pang, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

This high base effect will normalize from the fourth quarter of 2021,
the economist noted. The moderate growth in consumer price rate will
continue for a few months.

Producer price inflation surged to 6.8 percent in April from 4.4 percent
in March. This was the highest since October 2017 and well above
economists' forecast of 6.5 percent.

Month-on-month, producer prices grew 0.9 percent.

The rise in producer prices is feeding through to a rebound in consumer
price inflation, though with the latter still relatively subdued and
upstream price pressures likely to be mostly transient, inflation is
unlikely to become a key driver of central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Julian Evans-
Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital Economics, said.
