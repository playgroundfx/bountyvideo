UK retail sales grew for a fifth consecutive month in September and
exceeded expectations by a wide margin supported by food and online
sales as well as a recovery in non-food sales, preliminary data from the
Office for National Statistics showed on Friday.

The volume of retail sales grew 1.5 percent month-on-month in September,
which was much bigger than the 0.4 percent increase economists had
forecast.

The growth for August was revised up to 0.9 percent from 0.8 percent.

Sales excluding fuel rose 1.6 percent monthly, exceeding the forecast
for 0.5 percent growth, after a 0.6 percent increase in August.

Retail sales were 5.5 percent higher compared to February's pre-pandemic
level, ONS said.

Food stores sales grew for a second month, by 0.7 percent after a 0.4
percent increase in the previous month.

Non-food store sales grew 4 percent after a 3.2 percent increase in
August, led by a 7.3 percent growth in household goods sales. Fuel sales
rose just 0.1 percent.

The proportion of online sales was at 27.5 percent in September versus
20.1 percent in February. This was despite small monthly declines across
most of the retail sector.

The share of online sales by food stores nearly doubled to 10.4 percent
in September from 5.4 percent in February.

"Food stores and online retailers have fared particularly well in recent
months and most other store types have now recovered to pre-pandemic
levels too after being subject to temporary closures during restrictions
in the spring," ONS statistician Jonathan Athow said.

Spending on home improvement and gardening items in particular have
boosted sales, the ONS official said.

Athow also said that clothing store sales have been slower to recover
and fuel sales remain subdued as people continue to work from home and
have reduced the amount the travel.

On a year-on-year basis, retail sales increased 4.7 percent in September
following a revised 2.7 percent growth in the previous month. Excluding
fuel, retail sales rose 6.4 percent after a 4.3 percent growth in
August.

Economists had forecast 3.7 percent and 5 percent gains, respectively.

Meanwhile, the resurgence of [coronavirus][1] infection suggest economic
activity is likely to be hurt again in the coming months.

"While retail is unlikely to be as badly affected as other sectors by
the Covid-19 resurgence, the deteriorating outlook is nevertheless
another reason to think the post-lockdown recovery in UK economic
activity has reached its limit," ING economist James Smith said.

ING expects October monthly GDP to record a contraction.
