Russia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record
low as widely expected and signaled more easing at next meetings.

The Board of Directors, led by Governor Elvira Nabiullina, on Friday
decided to retain the benchmark rate at 4.25 percent.

The bank had reduced the rate by 25 basis points in July and 100 basis
points in June.

"If the situation develops in accordance with the baseline forecast, the
Bank of Russia will assess the feasibility of further cutting the key
rate at the next meetings," the bank said in a statement.

Policymakers observed that the situation in the external financial and
commodity [markets][1] remains unstable and increased volatility is
possible in the near future.

In the medium term, disinflationary risks still prevail, but the effect
of short-term pro-inflationary factors has increased somewhat,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers noted.

According to the bank forecast, annual inflation will be 3.5-4.0 percent
in 2021 and will remain close to 4 percent in the future.
