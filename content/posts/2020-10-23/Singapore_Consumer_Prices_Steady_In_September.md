Singapore's consumer prices remained unchanged in September, data from
the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and
Industry sowed on Friday.

The consumer price index remained unchanged year-on-year in September,
after a 0.4 percent fall in August. Economists had expected a 0.25
percent decline.

This latest inflation outcome was largely due to a more gradual decline
in private transport costs.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.1 percent annually in September, following a 0.3
percent decrease in the preceding month. Economists had forecast a 0.2
percent fall.

The latest modest decline can be attributed to smaller declines in the
costs of services, and electricity and gas.

The statistical office expects external inflation to remain low in the
coming quarters, amid weak demand conditions.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average between -5 percent and 0 percent this year, the statistical
office and MAS said.

Next year, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average 0-1 percent, while
CPI-All Items inflation is projected to be between -0.5 and 0.5 percent.
