Reflecting the gradual reopening of the [economy][1], the Labor
Department released a report on Friday showing a continued
reacceleration in the pace of U.S. job growth in the month of June.

The report showed non-farm payroll employment spiked by 850,000 jobs in
June after surging by an upwardly revised 583,000 jobs in May.

Economists had expected employment to jump by about 700,000 jobs
compared to the addition of 559,000 jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate unexpectedly
inched up to 5.9 percent in June from 5.8 percent in May. The
unemployment rate was expected to edge down to 5.7 percent.
