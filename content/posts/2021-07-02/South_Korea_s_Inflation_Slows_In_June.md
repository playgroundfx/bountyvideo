South Korea's consumer price inflation slowed in June but remained above
the central bank's target for the third straight month, data from
Statistics Korea showed on Friday.

Consumer prices grew 2.4 percent year-on-year in June, slower than the
2.6 percent increase seen in May and the economists' forecast of 2.5
percent.

Nonetheless, the rate remained above the target of 2 percent since
April. The 2.6 percent inflation rate posted in May was the highest
since early 2012.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices were down 0.1 percent, offsetting
May's 0.1 percent rise.

Excluding food and energy, core inflation held steady at 1.2 percent in
June.

Food and non-alcoholic beverages cost advanced 6.5 percent and transport
prices grew 8.3 percent. Clothing and footwear prices gained only 0.2
percent. At the same time, housing, water, electricity, gas and other
fuels prices rose 1.2 percent.
