With imports increasing by much more than exports, the Commerce
Department released a report on Friday showing the U.S. trade deficit
widened in the month of May.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $71.2 billion
in May from a revised $69.1 billion in April.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen $71.4 billion from
the $68.9 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider trade deficit came as the value of imports jumped by 1.3
percent to $277.3 billion in May from $273.8 billion in April.

A sharp increase in import of industrial supplies and materials helped
offset a notable decrease in imports of capital goods such as computers.

Meanwhile, the report showed the value of exports rose by 0.6 percent to
$206.0 billion in May from $204.7 billion in April.

Exports of pharmaceutical preparations saw a significant increase, but
the jump was partly offset by decreases in exports of passenger cars and
civilian aircraft.

"Robust domestic demand, powered by the wider reopening of the
[economy][1] and greatly improved health conditions, underpinned another
solid rise in imports," said Kathy Bostjancic, Chief U.S. Financial
Economist at Oxford Economics. "Export demand is less vigorous
reflecting softer foreign demand."

She added, "The trade deficit is poised to remain wide as the fiscally
powered, consumer driven recovery in the U.S. runs ahead of the global
economic rebound."

The Commerce Department said the goods deficit widened to $89.2 billion
in May from $86.9 billion in June, while the services surplus inched up
to $17.9 billion from $17.8 billion.
