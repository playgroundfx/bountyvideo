Germany's industrial output declined unexpectedly in August due to the
fall in consumer and capital goods production, data from Destatis
revealed Wednesday.

Industrial production dropped 0.2 percent on a monthly basis in August,
in contrast to a revised 1.4 percent rise posted in July. Economists had
forecast an increase of 1.5 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial production decreased 9.6 percent following
a 10 percent drop in July.

Excluding energy and construction, production was down by 0.7 percent
from July.

Within industry, the production of intermediate goods logged a monthly
growth of 3.3 percent. On the other hand, consumer goods output
decreased 1.3 percent and that of capital goods by 3.6 percent.

Production in the automotive industry, which was the largest branch of
manufacturing, fell by 12.5 percent on the previous month.

Outside industry, energy production grew 6.7 percent, while construction
output decreased 0.3 percent.

The [economy][1] ministry said the improved mood in companies, the
increasing number of incoming orders and the reduced working hours
suggest that the catching-up process is continuing.

Data released on Tuesday showed that factory orders climbed 4.5 percent
month-on-month in August, which was faster than the 3.3 percent rise in
July.

The outlook for the fourth quarter was better than for many economies
thanks to Germany's generous fiscal support and kurzarbeit scheme, and
strong export demand from outside the euro-zone, Andrew Kenningham, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

Nonetheless, the recovery in German industry has been disappointing so
far, and a return to full [health][2] remains a long way off, the
economist added.
