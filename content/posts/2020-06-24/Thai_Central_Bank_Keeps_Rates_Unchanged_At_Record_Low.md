Thailand's central bank retained its interest rate at a record low on
Wednesday, after lowering it by a quarter-point last month.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank of Thailand unanimously voted to
retain the interest rate at 0.50 percent. The bank had reduced the rate
by 25 basis points in May.

Policymakers assessed that the [economy][1] would shrink more than
previously estimated this year due to the impact of the covid-19
outbreak. Nonetheless, the economy would gradually recover in the second
half of the year.

The MPC observed that the economy required additional supply-side
policies to support the changing economic structure.

Inflation is forecast to be more negative this year than the previous
projection. Nonetheless, headline inflation would rise toward the target
with gradually rising crude oil prices.

Further, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers expressed concerns over the strengthening of the
Thai baht against the US Dollar as it could affect the economic
recovery.

Further, the MPC vowed to use additional appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
tools if necessary.
