New Zealand will on Thursday release May figures for imports, exports
and trade balance, highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

In April, imports were worth NZ$3.99 billion and exports were at NZ$5.26
billion for a trade surplus of NZ$1.267 billion.

Japan will see April figures for its all industry activity index; in
March, the index dipped 3.8 percent on month.

The central bank in the Philippines will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
meeting and then announce its decision on interest rates. The bank is
widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate steady at 2.75
percent.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong are closed on
Thursday for the Dragon Boat Festival. Hong Kong will be back in action
on Friday, while China and Taiwan are off until Monday.
