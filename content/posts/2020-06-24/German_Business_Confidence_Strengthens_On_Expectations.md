Germany's [business][1] sentiment strengthened at a record rate in June
on strong expectations as lockdown restrictions imposed to slow the
spread of the coronavirus were eased across Europe, a closely watched
survey showed Wednesday.

According to the ifo Institute, the business climate index rose to a
four-month high of 86.2 points from 79.7 points in May, revised from
79.5. Economists had forecast a score of 85.

This is the strongest increase ever recorded, the think tank said. The
index rose for a second straight month.

"German business sees light at the end of the tunnel," ifo President
Clemens Fuest said.

Companies' assessments of their current situation were somewhat better.
Moreover, their expectations leaped to a four-month high.

The current conditions index climbed to 81.3 from 78.9 in May.
Economists had expected a score of 84.

The expectations measure advanced to 91.4 from 80.5 in May, revised from
80.1. Economists were looking for a reading of 87.

Improvement in morale was witnessed in almost all economic sectors with
expectations rising at the strongest rate ever in manufacturing.
However, a majority of firms still assess their current situation as
poor.

In the service sector, the business climate continued its steep rise
driven by a particularly pronounced reduction in service providers'
pessimism regarding the coming six months.

In trade, business climate jumped again as both indicators of the
current situation and of expectations recovered notably from the
previous month.

In construction, less pessimistic expectations once again lifted the
business climate.

Today's Ifo index adds to the optimism that at least the first phase
after the lockdowns will be v-shaped, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist,
said. What comes after the 'v', however, is much more uncertain.

Capital Economics' economist Andrew Kenningham, said, the Ifo for June
echoes the message from the PMIs published yesterday that the rebound in
Germany has been a little faster, and the slump in GDP probably smaller
than anticipated. However, the recession has still been huge and will
cast a long shadow.

Purchasing Managers' survey showed that Germany's private sector showed
signs of a turnaround in June following a record downturn. The flash
composite output index climbed to 45.8 in June from 32.3 in the previous
month. This was the highest reading in four months.
