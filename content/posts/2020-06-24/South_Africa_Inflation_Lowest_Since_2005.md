housing and utilities, transport, and miscellaneous goods and services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 4.4 percent
annually in April and housing and utilities rose by 4.6 percent. Prices
for transport, and miscellaneous goods and services grew by 3.5 percent
and 6.4 percent, respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, the consumer price index decreased 0.5
percent in April. Economists had expected a 0.4 percent fall.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.2 percent in April. Economists had forecast a
3.6 percent rise.

On a monthly basis, the core CPI fell 0.2 percent in April.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the retail sales
rose 2.7 percent yearly in March, following a 1.9 percent increase in
February.

On a monthly basis, retail sales grew 2.3 percent in March, after a 0.3
percent fall in the prior month.

In the three months ended in March, retail sales increased 0.2 percent,
after a 0.9 percent fall in the preceding three months.
