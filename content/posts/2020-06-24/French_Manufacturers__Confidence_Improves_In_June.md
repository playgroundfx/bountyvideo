After collapsing to a record low in April, the personal production
expectations index advanced to +19 from -12 a month ago.

The balance of opinion on the general production prospects for the
sector picked up to -15 from -49 in May, but stayed well below its
average.

The total order book balance remained stable at -56 in June and the one
on foreign order books declined further to -65.

The indicator for past workforce size dropped o -29, while the indicator
for future workforce improved to -21 in June.

The overall business confidence index gained 18 points, the biggest
monthly rise since the start of the series in 1980. The score reached 78
in June, but remained below its long-term average of 100.
