Ireland's consumer confidence improved for the second straight month in
June after the lockdown triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic was eased,
survey data from the KBC Bank Ireland showed on Wednesday.

The consumer confidence index rose to 61.6 in June from 52.3 in May. In
the same month last year, the reading was 90.9.

"We would tend to highlight the significant further improvement in Irish
consumer sentiment in June as pointing to a somewhat less negative
outlook for the [economy][1]," KBC Ireland analyst Austin Hughes said.

"However, the cautious tone of responses to questions on personal
finances suggests a still fearful and, in many instances, financially
damaged Irish consumer."

The current conditions index increased to 77.5 in June from 70.1 in the
previous month.

The index of consumer expectation rose to 50.9 in June from 40.4 in the
preceding month.

The general economic outlook index increased sharply to 21.2 in June
from 9.5 in the preceding month. Outlook for employment rose to 56.2.

The index reflecting household's financial situation for the past 12
months rose to 65.5 in June and those for the next 12 months increased
to 75.3.
