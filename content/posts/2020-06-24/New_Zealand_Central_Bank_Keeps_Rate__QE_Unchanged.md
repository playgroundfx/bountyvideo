New Zealand's central bank maintained its interest rate and quantitative
easing unchanged as social restrictions to contain the spread of
[coronavirus][1] were relaxed and domestic operations resumed earlier
than expected.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, on
Wednesday, decided to hold its interest rate at a record low 0.25
percent.

The asset purchase programme was retained at NZ$60 billion after raising
it from GBP 33 billion last month.  
  
However, the MPC said it is prepared to provide additional stimulus as
necessary. As well as potentially expanding the large scale asset
purchase programme, the committee continues to prepare for the use of
additional monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools as needed.

The bank observed that the severe economic disruption caused by the
coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic is persisting, leading to lower
economic activity, employment and inflation. Further, the negative
impact was exacerbated by the border restrictions and the appreciation
of the New Zealand dollar.

The support for the domestic [economy][2] was appropriately being
provided through increased fiscal spending. However, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will continue to provide significant support.

Members noted that the extent of recovery will depend in part on the
impact of these [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures and the speed with which they are
implemented.

The central bank sounded fairly balanced when it left [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings
unchanged today, Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics, said. But
the bank is likely to cut rates into negative territory next year.
