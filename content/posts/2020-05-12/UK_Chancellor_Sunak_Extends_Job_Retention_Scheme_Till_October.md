UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme,
which was devised to protect jobs during the socio-economic crisis
caused by Covid-19, till the end of October.

The chancellor announced on Tuesday that workers will continue to
receive 80 percent of their current salary, upto GBP 2,500, under the
furlough scheme.  
  
Furloughed workers are expected to return to work part-time from the
start of August and employers are asked to pay a percentage towards
their salaries.

The employer payments will substitute the contribution the government is
currently making, ensuring that staff continue to receive 80 percent of
their salary.

"Our Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected millions of jobs and
businesses across the UK during the outbreak - and I've been clear that
I want to avoid a cliff edge and get people back to work in a measured
way," Sunak said.

"This extension and the changes we are making to the scheme will give
flexibility to businesses while protecting the livelihoods of the
British people and our future economic prospects."

Official figures released on Tuesday showed that the job retention
scheme protected 7.5 million workers and almost 1 million businesses,
the chancellor said.  
  
The government expects to add more flexibility to the scheme from the
start of August.  
Further, official figures showed that businesses benefited from over GBP
14 billion in loans and guarantees to support their cashflow during the
crisis.  
  
This includes 268,000 Bounce Back Loans worth GBP 8.3 billion, 36,000
loans worth over GBP 6 billion through the Coronavirus Business
Interruption Loan Scheme, and GBP 359 million through the Coronavirus
Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the HM Treasury said.  
  
Groups representing UK businesses such as FSB, BCC and CBI welcome the
extension of the Job Retention Scheme.
