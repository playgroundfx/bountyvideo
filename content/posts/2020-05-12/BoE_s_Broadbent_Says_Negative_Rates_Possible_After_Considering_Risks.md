Bank of England is likely to consider more monetary easing in future
after weighing the side-effects of negative interest rates, to help the
UK [economy][1] recover from the historic shock dealt by the
coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic, Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said
Tuesday.

The Monetary Policy Committee is "certainly prepared to do what is
necessary" despite downside risks, Broadbent told CNBC in an interview.  
  
The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker said it is possible that more monetary easing will be
needed in future, and the central bank will need to take a balanced view
regarding the tools at its disposal.  
  
Earlier this month, the Bank of England maintained its key interest rate
at a record low and refrained from unveiling additional quantitative
easing as the economic outlook remained highly uncertain.

The MPC voted 7-2 to continue with the quantitative easing of GBP 645
billion. Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders sought an increase in the
target for the stock of asset purchases by an additional GBP 100
billion.
