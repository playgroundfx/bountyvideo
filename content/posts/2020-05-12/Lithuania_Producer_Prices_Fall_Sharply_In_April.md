Lithuania's producer prices declined at a faster pace in April, figures
from Statistics Lithuania showed on Tuesday.

The producer price index decreased 15.5 percent year-on-year in April,
following an 8.9 percent decrease in March.

Excluding refined petroleum products, producer prices fell 2.4 percent
annually in April, following a 1.1 percent decline in the preceding
month.

Producer prices for products sold on the Lithuanian market decreased by
10.2 percent annually in April. Prices for products sold on the foreign
market fell by 19.1 percent from a year ago.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices fell 5.3 percent in April,
following a 7.3 percent decrease in the prior month.

The decline in prices was mainly due to lower prices for refined
petroleum products, the agency said.
