Malaysia's industrial production dropped in March, data from the
Department of Statistics showed on Tuesday.

Industrial production fell 4.9 percent year-on-year in March, after a
6.2 percent increase in February. Economists had expected a 5.0 percent
decline.

Manufacturing output declined 4.2 percent in March, after a 6.2 percent
rise in the previous month.

Among other sectors, mining and quarrying output decreased 6.5 percent
and electricity output fell 7.0 percent.

In the first quarter, industrial production rose 0.4 percent compared to
previous year. This was mainly due to the 1.3 percent growth in
manufacturing sector.
