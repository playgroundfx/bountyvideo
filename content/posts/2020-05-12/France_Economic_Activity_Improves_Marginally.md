French economic activity improved only marginally in April and overall
performance is set to remain below normal after the government started
easing the curbs imposed to avoid the spread of [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, survey data from Bank of France showed Tuesday.

The [economy][2] is operating about 27 percent below normal levels in
April compared to 32 percent in March.

"The ambition we could have for the end of May is to recover another 10
points," Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy said on France Inter
radio.

The governor said the two months of lockdown has cost the second largest
euro area nation around 6 percent in annual growth.

Industrial production declined across the board as the lockdown was
effective throughout the month, the survey showed. Agri-food, chemicals
and pharmaceuticals were the least affected sectors in April.

Business leaders expect a partial recovery in May.

At the same time, the service sector reported a marked decrease in
activity in April. Leaders see a nascent recovery with differences
across sectors.

In construction, activity continued to be affected by the coronavirus
pandemic, but to a lesser extent than in March. However, construction
activity is forecast to rebound significantly but this will not offset
the losses incurred.
