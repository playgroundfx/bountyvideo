Consumer prices in China were up 3.3 percent on year in April, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.

That was beneath expectations for an annual increase of 3.7 percent and
down from 4.3 percent in March.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices sank 0.9 percent - again missing
forecasts for a decline of 0.5 percent after sliding 1.2 percent in the
previous month.

The stats bureau also reported that producer prices tumbled 3.1 percent
on year - well shy of expectations for a drop of 2.6 percent and down
sharply from the 1.5 percent decline a month earlier.
