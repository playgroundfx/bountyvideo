The Bank of Japan will on Tuesday release the minutes from the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on July 15 and 16, highlighting a modest day for Asia-
Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the BoJ decided to keep its monetary stimulus unchanged
and unveiled a preliminary outline for the new program to support
efforts on climate change.

The bank also lowered its near-term growth outlook citing the impact of
the [coronavirus][1] pandemic and raised its fiscal 2021 inflation
forecast. The board also voted to hold the interest rate at -0.1 percent
on current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central
bank.

Australia will provide August figures for retail sales; in July, sales
were down 2.7 percent on month.

Hong Kong will release August numbers for imports, exports and trade
balance. In July, imports were up 26.1 percent and exports rose an
annual 26.9 percent for a trade deficit of HKD34.9 billion.
