Finland's consumer confidence improved and industrial morale weakened in
September, separate survey results showed on Monday.

The consumer sentiment index increased to 6.0 in September from 4.0 in
August, Statistics Finland said.

All the four components improved strongly in September. Consumers' views
of their own [economy][1] at present were brightest in the survey
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

The data was collected from 1,015 persons between September 1 and 19.

Data from the Confederation of Finnish Industries showed that the
manufacturing confidence index fell one points to 21 in September from
22 in August. The reading was above the long-term average of +1.

The construction confidence indicator increased to 7 in September from 5
in August. The reading was weaker than its long-term average of -7.

The service sector confidence indicator remained unchanged at 15 in
September.

The retail trade confidence grew four points to 13 in September, which
was above the long-term average of -1.
