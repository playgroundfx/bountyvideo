New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods increased by much more
than expected in the month of August, according to a report released the
Commerce Department on Monday.

The report said durable goods orders jumped by 1.8 percent in August
after rising by a revised 0.5 percent in July.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to increase by 0.6 percent
compared to the 0.1 percent dip that had been reported for the previous
month.

The bigger than expected increase in durable goods orders was largely
due to a spike in orders for transportation equipment, which shot up by
5.5 percent in August after dipping by 0.4 percent in July.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts led the way higher, soaring by
77.9 percent in August after plunging by 36.3 percent in July.

Excluding the rebound in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders edged up by 0.2 percent in August after climbing by 0.8
percent in July.

Notable increases in orders for fabricated metal products, computers and
electronic products and electrical equipment, appliances and components
were partly offset by a drop in orders for machinery.

The report said new orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a closely watched indicator of [business][1] spending, climbed
by 0.5 percent in August after rising by 0.3 percent in July.
