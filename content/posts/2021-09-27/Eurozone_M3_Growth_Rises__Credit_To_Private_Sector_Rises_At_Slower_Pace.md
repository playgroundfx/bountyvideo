Eurozone money supply growth accelerated in August, while credit to the
private sector slowed further, data published by the European Central
Bank showed on Monday.

The broad money supply M3 grew 7.9 percent year-on-year in August,
following July's 7.6 percent increase. M3 was forecast to advance 7.8
percent.

Likewise, growth in the narrow measure M1 increased to 11.1 percent from
11 percent a month ago.  
  
As regards the dynamics of credit, data showed that credit to the
private sector logged an annual growth of 3.1 percent, slower than the
3.4 percent increase in July.

percent after climbing 3 percent in July.
