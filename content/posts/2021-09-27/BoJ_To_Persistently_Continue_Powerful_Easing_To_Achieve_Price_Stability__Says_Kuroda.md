The Bank of Japan will persistently continue with powerful monetary
easing in order to achieve price stability target sustainably, Governor
Kuroda Haruhiko said Monday.

In longer-term, even though the inflation rate will gradually rise
toward fiscal 2023, the end of the current projection period, it will
not reach the price stability target of 2 percent, he told [business][1]
leaders in Osaka.  
  
Further, he said the mechanism for the [economy][2] to pick up has
continued to work despite the successive waves of Covid-19.

In a report released earlier in the day, the BoJ said services producer
price inflation eased marginally to 1 percent in August from 1.1 percent
in July.

On a monthly basis, services prices dropped 0.1 percent, in contrast to
the 0.3 percent increase in the prior month.
