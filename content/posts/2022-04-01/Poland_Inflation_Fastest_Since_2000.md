Poland's consumer prices increased at the fastest pace since 2000 on
rising energy prices, data from Statistics Poland showed on Friday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 10.9 percent in March from 8.5 percent
in February. This was the highest inflation since 2000. Economists had
forecast inflation to rise to 10.1 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices were up 3.2 percent in March, faster
than the economists' forecast of 2.5 percent.

Cost of food and on-alcoholic beverages climbed 9.2 percent annually and
electricity, gas and other fuel prices advanced 23.9 percent. At the
same time, fuels for personal transport grew 33.5 percent.

The Polish [economy][1] is absorbing new shocks and inflation will
continue running at a double-digit pace in the coming quarters, Rafal
Benecki and Adam Antoniak, ING economists, said.
