After reporting a sharp increase in U.S. construction spending in the
previous month, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday
showing construction spending rose by much less than expected in the
month of February.

The Commerce Department said construction spending climbed 0.5 percent
to an annual rate of $1.704 trillion in February after surging 1.6
percent to a revised rate of $1.696 trillion in January.

Economists had expected construction spending to increase by 1.0 percent
compared to the 1.3 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

The report showed spending on private construction advanced by 0.8
percent to a rate of $1.354 trillion, reflecting a 1.1 percent jump in
spending on residential construction and a 0.2 percent uptick in
spending on non-residential construction.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said spending on public construction
fell by 0.4 percent to a rate of $350.7 billion, as spending both
educational and highway construction tumbled by 1.3 percent.
