A closely watched report released by the Labor Department on Friday
showed U.S. employment increased by less than expected in the month of
March.

The report showed non-farm payroll employment jumped by 431,000 jobs in
March after surging by an upwardly revised 750,000 jobs in February.

Economists had expected employment to spike by 490,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 678,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The strong job growth still contributed to a drop in the unemployment
rate, which dipped to 3.6 percent in March from 3.8 percent in February.
The unemployment rate was expected to edge down to 3.7 percent.

With the bigger than expected decrease, the unemployment rate fell to
its lowest level since hitting 3.5 percent in February of 2020.
