Poland's manufacturing sector growth eased to the lowest since the
beginning of 2021, the impact of war in Ukraine due to the uncertainty
caused by the war in Ukraine and increased inflationary pressures around
the world, survey data from S&P Global showed on Friday.

The manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, fell to 52.7 in
March from 54.7 in February.

Economists had forecast a score of 53.1. A PMI reading above 50 suggests
expansion in the sector.

"The tragic development of war in Ukraine had an inevitable
destabilizing impact on the Polish manufacturing sector in March," Paul
Smith, economics director at S&P Global, said.

Production declined for the first time in fourteen months in March and
contraction in sales ended a fifteen-month sequence of growth.

Export orders dropped to the steepest since mid-2020 and suppliers'
delivery time was delayed due to Russia-Ukraine war.

Input price inflation rose to the highest since July last year.

The sentiment weakened to its lowest level since November 2020, while
firms have retained a positive outlook, with the hope that if price and
supply chain difficulties disappear, then a post-pandemic rise in sales
will lead to output growth in the coming 12 months.
