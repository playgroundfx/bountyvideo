The total value of owner-occupied home loans in Australia was down a
seasonally adjusted 4.7 percent on month in February, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said on Friday - coming in at A$21.53 billion.

That missed forecasts for an increase of 1.0 percent, which would have
been unchanged from the previous month.

Investment lending was down 1.8 percent on month to A$10.75 billion, so
overall home loans sank 3.7 percent on month to A$32.28 billion.

On a yearly basis, owner-occupied home loans dipped 1.0 percent,
investment lending surged 55.8 percent and overall lending climbed 12.6
percent.
