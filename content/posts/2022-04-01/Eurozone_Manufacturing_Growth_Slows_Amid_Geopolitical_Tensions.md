Eurozone manufacturing sector registered its slowest growth in 14 months
in March as geopolitical tensions weighed on demand and confidence,
final survey results from S&P Global showed on Friday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 56.5 in March from
58.2 in February. The score was also below the flash estimate of 57.0.

This was the slowest growth faced by producers since the beginning of
2021.

The survey showed that amid surging commodity, fuel and energy costs,
input price inflation re-accelerated to a four-month high. To offset
margin pressures, eurozone manufacturers raised their charges to the
greatest extent in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Growth momentum in new orders eased notably as geopolitical tensions led
to increased hesitance among clients. Export demand declined during
March for the first time since June 2020.

The survey showed a significant decline in [business][1] confidence in
March. Manufacturing employment grew at a pace stronger than the series
average, but the weakest since February 2021.

Heightened risk aversion among both manufacturers and their customers
due to the uncertainty caused by the invasion, combined with an
intensifying cost of living crisis, meanwhile threatens to pull growth
even lower in the coming months, Chris Williamson, chief business
economist at S&P Global said.

According to S&P survey, rates of expansion slowed in all major eurozone
economies in March.

Reflecting the impact of the war in Ukraine, Germany's manufacturing
growth hit an 18-month low. The final PMI dropped to 56.9 in March from
58.4 a month ago. The flash score was 57.6.

At the same time, France's final manufacturing PMI fell to 54.7 in March
from 57.2 in the prior month. The reading was slightly below the flash
54.8.

Italy's manufacturing growth was curtailed by ongoing supply chain
issues and material shortages. The factory PMI came in at 55.8, up from
58.3 in February. The reading was forecast to fall moderately to 57.0.

Likewise, Spain's manufacturing sector continued to expand in March but
at a slower pace. The manufacturing PMI dropped to 54.2 in March from
56.9 in April. This was the lowest reading for over a year.
