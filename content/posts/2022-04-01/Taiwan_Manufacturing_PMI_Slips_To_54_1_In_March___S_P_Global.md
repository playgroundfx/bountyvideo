The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to expand in March, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from S&P Global showed on Friday
with a manufacturing PMI score of 54.1.

That's down from 54.3 in February although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Slower increases in output, new orders, employment and stocks of
purchases all weighed on the headline index. The suppliers delivery
times index was the only component to have a positive directional
influence on the headline figure, which showed a steeper deterioration
in average vendor performance.

Goods producers in Taiwan signaled a weaker increase in output at the
end of the first quarter amid reports of subdued client demand and low
raw material availability. Notably, the rate of production growth was
the slowest seen for four months and only marginal.
