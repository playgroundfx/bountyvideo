The Czech Republic's manufacturing sector growth eased to the slowest
since November 2020, mainly due to contraction in output and new orders,
survey data from S&P Global showed on Friday.

The purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for the manufacturing sector
fell to 54.7 in March from 56.5 in February.

Economists had forecast a reading of 55.3. A PMI reading above 50
signals growth in the sector.

Output declined for the first time since October, which led to weaker
client demand, staff shortages, raw material scarcity and growing
uncertainty as the war in Ukraine continues.

New orders decreased in March and new export bookings from abroad
deteriorated at the fastest pace since July 2020.

Cost burden increased in March, as the rate of inflation rose to 2021's
record. The rate of charged inflation was the second-sharpest on record.

Suppliers' lead time lengthened in March to the greatest level for three
months.

Firms output expectation dropped to the lowest in twenty-two months in
March. The Russia-Ukraine war and rising operational expenses eroded
sentiment.

The rate of job creation was the slowest since October 2021 and backlogs
of work increased in March.

Stocks of finished goods declined at the weakest rate since February
last year.

"Inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty led to a reduce
appetite for spending among both domestic and foreign customers, with
some firms highlighting the loss of key export [markets][1] in Russia
and Ukraine," Sian Jones, senior economist at S&P Global, said.
