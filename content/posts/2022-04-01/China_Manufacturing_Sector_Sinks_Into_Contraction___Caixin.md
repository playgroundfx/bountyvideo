The manufacturing sector in China slipped into contraction in March, the
latest survey from Caixin showed on Friday with a manufacturing PMI
score of 48.1.

That's down from 50.4 in February and it moves beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The drop in the headline PMI was partly driven by a renewed and solid
fall in production at Chinese manufacturing firms in March. Furthermore,
the rate of contraction was the steepest seen for 25 months. Companies
frequently mentioned that the measures to contain the spread of COVID-19
had disrupted operations, supply and dampened customer demand.

New orders likewise fell at the sharpest rate since February 2020 in
March. Companies commented that both domestic and foreign demand had
waned, with new export [business][1] declining at the fastest pace for
22 months. The pandemic, and difficulties shipping items to clients, as
well as greater market uncertainty due to the Ukraine war had dampened
sales, according to panelists.

Disruption to business operations and logistics due to containment
measures led to a further deterioration in average supplier performance.
Notably, the rate at which delivery times increased was the fastest
since last October.
