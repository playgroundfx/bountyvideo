A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed wholesale
inventories in the U.S. surged by more than expected in the month of
February.

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories spiked by 2.5 percent
in February after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.2 percent in January.

Economists had expected wholesale inventories to shoot up by 2.1 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Inventories of durable goods jumped by 1.9 percent, while inventories of
non-durable goods soared by 3.3 percent.

The report also showed wholesale sales surged by 1.7 percent in February
after skyrocketing by 5.0 percent in January.

With inventories spiking by more than sales, the inventories/sales ratio
for merchant wholesalers inched up to 1.21 in February from 1.20 in
January.
