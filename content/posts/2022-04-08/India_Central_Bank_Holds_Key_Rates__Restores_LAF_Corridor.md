India's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged, as widely
expected, on Friday and introduced the Standing Deposit Facility to
absorb the excess liquidity.

At the first bi-monthly meeting of the financial year, the Monetary
Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India, led by Governor
Shaktikanta Das, unanimously decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate at
4.00 percent. The reverse repo rate was left unchanged at 3.35 percent.

The last change in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate was in May 2020, when the repo rate
was reduced by 40 basis points.

The marginal standing facility rate and the bank rate were also
maintained at 4.25 percent.

The MPC unanimously decided to remain accommodative while focusing on
withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the
target going forward, while supporting growth.  
  
The committee observed that the escalation of the geopolitical situation
and the accompanying surge in international crude oil and other
commodity prices, tightening of global financial conditions, persistence
of supply-side disruptions and significantly weaker external demand pose
downside risks to the outlook.

Also, the future course of the pandemic and the uncertainties about the
pace of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization in major advanced economies weigh
on the outlook.

The central bank today downgraded its growth outlook for the fiscal year
2022-23 to 7.2 percent from 7.8 percent.

In February, consumer price inflation at 6.07 percent, breached the
central bank's upper end of the target range.

With the broad-based surge in prices of key industrial inputs and global
supply chain disruptions, input cost push pressures appear likely to
persist for longer than expected earlier, RBI said.  
  
Their pass-through to retail prices, though limited till now given the
continuing slack in the [economy][1], needs to be monitored carefully.  
  
The RBI upgraded its inflation forecast for the current fiscal year to
5.7 percent from 4.5 percent.

Further, the central bank restored the width of the Liquidity Adjustment
Facility corridor to 50 basis points, the position that prevailed before
the pandemic.

The newly instituted standing deposit facility, or SDF, which will be
placed 25 basis points below the repo rate, will act as the floor of the
corridor. The MSF rate will continue to be 25 basis points above the
repo rate.

As a result, the width of the LAF corridor was restored to the pre-
pandemic configuration of 50 basis points.

The fixed rate reverse repo rate was retained at 3.35 percent. It will
remain as part of RBI's toolkit and its operation will be at the
discretion of the RBI for purposes specified from time to time, the bank
said.

The new liquidity framework indicates a less accommodative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance, Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

But with inflation likely to be higher than the MPC expects, further
tightening steps will need to be taken and the repo rate will be hiked
before long, the economist noted.
