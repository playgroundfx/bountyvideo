Russia's central bank unexpectedly slashed its key rate by 300 basis
points on Friday, citing challenging external conditions.

At an unscheduled meeting, the Board of Directors of Bank of Russia
decided to cut the benchmark rate to 17.00 percent from 20.00 percent.

The bank said today's decision reflects a change in the balance of risks
of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and
financial stability risks.

On February 28, the central bank had hiked its interest rate sharply to
20.00 percent from 9.50 percent. The bank said the decision had helped
to sustain financial stability and prevented uncontrolled price rises.

Signaling monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, the central bank today said it "holds
open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming
meetings."

The central bank noted that there is a steady inflow of funds to fixed-
term deposits. Although inflation is set to continue to rise due to the
base effect, latest weekly data suggested a noticeable slowdown in the
current growth rates.

It is clear that the central bank assessed that Russia's [economy][1] is
now emerging from the most acute phase of its crisis and that such
restrictive monetary conditions are no longer warranted, Liam Peach, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

"If the experience of the 2014/15 ruble crisis is any guide, a large
interest rate cut (like that seen today) is likely to be followed by
much more gradual easing as the CBR targets a large positive real
interest rate to bring inflation back down to its target," said Peach.
