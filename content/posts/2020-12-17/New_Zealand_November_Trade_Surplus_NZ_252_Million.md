New Zealand posted a merchandise trade surplus of NZ$252 million in
November, Statistics New Zealand said on Friday - following the NZ$500
million deficit in October.

Exports were down 0.2 percent on year at NZ$5.2 billion, up from NZ$4.78
billion in October.

Meat and offal exports were down NZ$73 million (11 percent) from
November 2019, while other export commodities to fall included crude oil
(down NZ$33 million) and mechanical machinery and equipment (down NZ$28
million).

Imports plummeted 17 percent on year to NZ$4.95 billion, down from
NZ$5.29 billion in the previous month.

Imports saw large falls for cars, fuels, and other commodities but were
partly offset by a lift in cell phone imports.
