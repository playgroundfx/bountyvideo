The Bank of Japan will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Friday and
then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a light day
for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The BoJ is widely expected to keep
its benchmark lending rate unchanged at -0.1 percent.

Japan also will see November inflation data; in October, overall
inflation was down 0.4 percent on year and 0.1 percent on month, while
core CPI slipped an annual 0.7 percent.

New Zealand will provide November figures for imports, exports and trade
balance. In October, imports were worth NZ$5.29 billion and exports were
at NZ$4.78 billion for a trade deficit of NZ$500 million.

New Zealand also will see December results for the [business][1]
confidence index from ANZ; in November, the index fell 6.9 percent.
