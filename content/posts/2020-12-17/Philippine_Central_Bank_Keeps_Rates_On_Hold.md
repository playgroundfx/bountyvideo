The Philippine central bank maintained its key interest rates as widely
expected on Thursday after lowering the rate by a quarter-point in
November.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, or BSP, decided
to retain the overnight reverse repurchase facility rate at 2.00
percent.

The bank had reduced its key rate by 50 basis points each in June, April
and March and by 25 basis points in February and November.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
retained at 1.50 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively.

"The Monetary Board believes that an accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance, together with sustained fiscal initiatives to ensure public
welfare, should quicken the [economy][1]'s transition toward a
sustainable recovery," the bank said.

Inflation has risen slightly due to the sharp increase in global oil
prices and the higher-than-expected food inflation in November. However,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers expect future inflation path to remain firmly within the
government's 2-4 percent target over the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) horizon.

The bank viewed that optimism over the delivery of vaccines has lifted
market confidence, supporting improved prospects for global growth. On
the domestic front, the board also observed early indications of
improved mobility and sentiment.

While recent natural calamities could pose strong headwinds to growth,
the further easing of Covid-19 related restrictions will facilitate the
recovery of the economy in months ahead, the bank added.

With the recovery set to disappoint and inflation likely to stay on
target, more easing is likely next year, Alex Holmes, an economist at
Capital Economics, said. The economist has pencilled in 50 basis points
of cuts.
