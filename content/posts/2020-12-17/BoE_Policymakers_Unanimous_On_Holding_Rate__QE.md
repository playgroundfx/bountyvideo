Policymakers of the Bank of England unanimously decided to retain the
record low UK interest rate and quantitative easing amid uncertainty
over the post-Brexit trade deal.

The nine-member monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee voted to hold the interest
rate at 0.10 percent and the quantitative easing at GBP 895 billion, as
widely expected, on Thursday.

At the November meeting, the bank had raised the size of the asset
purchase programme by GBP 150 billion to the current level.

The successful trialling of some Covid vaccines and initial plans to
roll them out widely over the first half of next year is likely to
reduce the downside risks to the economic outlook than previously
assessed.

The additional fiscal measures in Spending Review 2020 are likely to
boost GDP by an estimated peak of over 1 percent during 2021-22, the
bank said.

Although inflation eased to 0.3 percent in November, it is expected to
rise quite sharply towards the target in the spring, as the VAT cut
comes to an end and the large fall in energy prices earlier this year
drops out of the annual comparison.

If the outlook for inflation weakens, the MPC said it stands ready to
take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit.
