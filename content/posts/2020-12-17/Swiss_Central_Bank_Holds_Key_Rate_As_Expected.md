The Swiss central bank decided to maintain its negative interest rates
to stabilize economic activity and price developments.

The Swiss National Bank retained the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and interest on sight
deposits at the SNB at a record low -0.75 percent, as widely expected.

As the Swiss franc is highly valued, the central bank reiterated that it
is willing to intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market. In
so doing, it takes the overall exchange rate situation into
consideration.

The bank said its expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) provides favorable
financing conditions, counters upward pressure on the Swiss franc, and
contributes to an appropriate supply of credit and liquidity to the
[economy][1].

Consumer prices are forecast to fall 0.7 percent this year and to remain
flat next year. In 2022, prices are projected to climb 0.2 percent.

In September, the bank had projected a 0.6 percent drop in prices for
2020 and +0.1 percent for 2021.

Further, the bank expects economic momentum to be weak in the fourth
quarter of 2020 and in the first quarter of next year due to new
restrictions imposed to control the Covid-19 pandemic.

The SNB expects that GDP to shrink by around 3 percent this year.

Developments going forward largely depend on how successfully the spread
of the virus can be contained in Switzerland and abroad. The SNB
forecast economic growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent for 2021.
