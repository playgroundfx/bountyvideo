Europe's new car registrations logged a double-digit decline in November
as several European governments introduced new measures to contain the
second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association reported Thursday.

New car sales decreased 12 percent year-on-year in November after easing
7.8 percent in October.

France and Spain reported the biggest decreases of 27.0 percent and 18.7
percent respectively. At the same time, Italy's car registrations were
down 8.3 percent and sales in Germany dropped moderately by 3 percent.

During January to November, the EU passenger car market contracted 25.5
percent to roughly 9 million units. Data showed that eleven months into
the year, the impact of pandemic continued to weigh heavily on the
cumulative performance of all EU [markets][1].
