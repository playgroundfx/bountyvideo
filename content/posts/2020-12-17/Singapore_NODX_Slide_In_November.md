Non-oil domestic exports in Singapore dropped 4.9 percent on year in
November, Enterprise Singapore said on Thursday - missing forecasts for
a gain of 2.0 percent following the 3.1 percent drop in October.

On a monthly basis, NODX slid 3.8 percent - again shy of expectations
for a gain of 6.2 percent following the 5.4 percent decline in the
previous month.

The decline was mainly due to decreases among petrochemicals,
pharmaceuticals, non-monetary gold and electronics.

NODX to the top 10 [markets][1] as a whole decreased in November,
although exports to the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand
and Hong Kong increased.
