UK house prices continued to increase in May driven by robust demand and
shortfall of new instructions, survey results from the Royal Institution
of Chartered Surveyors, or RICS, showed on Thursday.

The house price balance rose to 83 percent in May from 76 percent in
April. This was the fourth successive month in which upward pressure on
house price seemingly intensified, RICS said.

A net 45 percent of respondents expect house prices to rise in the near-
term, which was virtually unchanged from the net 47 percent in April.  
  
Likewise, twelve month price expectations remained elevated, with a net
balance of +64 percent of contributors anticipating an increase over the
year to come.

The survey showed that underpinning the recent acceleration in price
growth, new instructions coming onto the market have become increasingly
scarce over recent months, with the latest net balance coming in at -23
percent compared to -4 percent in April.

As a result, the gap between the new buyer enquires and new instructions
series reached its widest since November 2013.

A net 32 percent of survey participants reported an increase in new
buyer enquiries in May, marking the third straight positive monthly
reading for the indicator.

Newly agreed sales also increased in May, evidenced by a net balance of
+30 percent of contributors reporting an increase.
