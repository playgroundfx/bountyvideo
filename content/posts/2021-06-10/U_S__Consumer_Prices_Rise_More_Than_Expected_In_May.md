A highly anticipated report released by the Labor Department on Thursday
showed consumer prices in the U.S. increased by more than expected in
the month of May.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.6 percent
in May after climbing by 0.8 percent in April. Economists had expected
consumer prices to increase by 0.4 percent.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices climbed by 0.7
percent in May following a 0.9 percent advance in April. Core prices
were also expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

The report also showed consumer prices in May were up by 5.0 percent
compared to the same month a year ago, reflecting the biggest spike
since August of 2008.

The annual rate of core consumer price growth also accelerated to 3.8
percent in May, which represents the biggest jump since June of 1992.
