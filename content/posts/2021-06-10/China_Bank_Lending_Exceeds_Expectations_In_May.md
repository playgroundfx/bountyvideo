Chinese bank lending exceeded expectations in May, data from the
People's Bank of China revealed Thursday.

Banks extended CNY 1.5 trillion new loans in May, almost unchanged from
the previous month's CNY 1.47 trillion. The expected level was CNY 1.4
trillion.

Total social financing increased marginally to CNY 1.9 trillion in May
but remained below the economists' forecast of CNY 2 trillion.

The broad M2 money supply grew 8.3 percent, faster than the 8.1 percent
increase seen in April.

The slowdown in credit growth is happening even faster than anticipated
a couple of months ago, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. The slowdown is expected to continue over the coming
months.

While the [economy][1] has so far weathered the withdrawal in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
support very well, the usual lags mean that weaker credit growth will
become a growing headwind to activity over the next few quarters, Evans-
Pritchard noted.
