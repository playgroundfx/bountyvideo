The manufacturing sector in New Zealand continued to expand in May, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Friday
with a Performance of Manufacturing Index score of 58.6.

That's up from the downwardly revised 58.3 in April (originally 58.4)
and it moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates
expansion from contraction.

Individually, all five components remain in expansion including
production (65.3), new orders (63.7), deliveries (53.5), finished stocks
(52.4) and employment (51.5).

"Globally, manufacturing activity continues to expand at a robust pace,
culminating in an 11-year high for May," said BusinessNZ executive
director for manufacturing Catherine Beard. "However, this has led to
upwards pressure on input prices across most countries, including New
Zealand, given comments from respondents outlining increased costs of
raw materials."
