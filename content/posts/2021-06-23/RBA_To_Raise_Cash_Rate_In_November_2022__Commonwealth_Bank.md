The Reserve Bank of Australia is set to hike its cash rate in November
2022, which is earlier than its current guidance of "2024 at the
earliest", economists at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said
Wednesday.  
  
"We have penciled in an increase of 15 basis points which would take the
cash rate to 0.25 percent," Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at
CBA, said in a research note.  
  
The bank expects that to be followed by an increase of 25 basis points
in December 2022.

The CBA economists also expect three further 25-basis point hikes in the
first, second and third quarters of 2023. That would take the cash rate
to 1.25 percent, the level at which the bank assess the cash rate to be
neutral.  
  
The two key assumptions that underpin the bank's RBA call are the
continuation of the expansionary fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) over the next few years
and an increase in the net overseas immigration from mid-2022, but at a
slower rate than pre-Covid.  
  
"The forward looking indicators of labor demand are very strong yet
labor supply is constrained, which means the labor market will continue
to tighten very quickly and wages growth will accelerate," Aird said.

"The Commonwealth fiscal stance as well as the targeted level of net
overseas immigration in 2022/23 will have a large bearing on nominal
wage outcomes and therefore the path of interest rates."
