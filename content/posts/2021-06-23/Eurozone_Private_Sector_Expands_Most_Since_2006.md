The euro area private sector grew at the fastest rate in 15 years in
June as the [economy][1] re-opened further from virus-fighting
restrictions and vaccine progress boosted confidence, flash survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

At 59.2, the flash composite output index hit a 180-month high, up from
57.1 in May. The reading was also above economists' forecast of 58.8.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to 58.0 in June from
55.2 in the previous month.

The manufacturing PMI held steady at 63.1 in June, while it was forecast
to fall to 62.1.

"The data set the scene for an impressive expansion of GDP in the second
quarter to be followed by even stronger growth in the third quarter,"
Chris Williamson, chief [business][2] economist at IHS Markit said.
