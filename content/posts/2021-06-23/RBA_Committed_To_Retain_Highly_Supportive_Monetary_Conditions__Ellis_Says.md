The Reserve Bank of Australia remains committed to maintain highly
supportive monetary conditions as the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings help to return to
full employment and inflation consistent with the target, Assistant
Governor Luci Ellis, said Wednesday.

At the height of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the task for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
to build a bridge to the recovery, Ellis said in a speech to the Ai
Group.

As economies move through recovery to the expansion phase, the focus
naturally turns to sustaining that expansion, the banker noted.
Absorbing spare capacity and achieving full employment is an important
national priority.

Full employment is also a precondition for achieving the rates of wages
growth that would be consistent with inflation being sustainably within
the 2-3 percent target range that the RBA is mandated to achieve, said
Ellis.
