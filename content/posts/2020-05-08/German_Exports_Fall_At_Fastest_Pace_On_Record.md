German exports declined the most on record in March as foreign demand
was dampened by [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic, official data
showed Friday.

Exports fell by seasonally adjusted 11.8 percent month-on-month, in
contrast to February's 1.2 percent rise, Destatis reported.

This was the strongest decline since the beginning of the time series in
August 1990. Economists had forecast a monthly decrease of 5 percent in
March.

Likewise, imports dropped 5.1 percent on month, the largest fall since
January 2009. Economists had forecast imports to drop 4 percent after
easing1.5 percent in February.

Consequently, the trade surplus declined to a seasonally adjusted EUR
12.8 billion from EUR 21.4 billion a month ago.

On a yearly basis, exports and imports decreased 7.9 percent and 4.5
percent respectively.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus fell to EUR 17.4 billion from
EUR 22.3 billion in the same period last year.

The current account showed a surplus of EUR 24.4 billion versus EUR 30.9
billion last year.
