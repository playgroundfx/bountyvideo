Finland's industrial production rose for the second straight month in
March, figures from Statistics Finland showed on Friday.

Industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.9 percent
month-on-month in March, following a 0.7 percent rise in February.

Manufacturing output rose 1.7 percent on a monthly basis in March, while
output in mining and quarrying industry declined 8.6 percent.

Among industries, output grew in March most in the forest industry, by
39.6 percent and in the chemical industry, by 23.8 percent, which was
partly driven by the pharmaceutical industry and increased demand for
cleaning agents and disinfectants amid the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, epidemic.

On an annual basis, industrial production rose a working-day adjusted
2.8 percent in March, following a 0.8 percent decrease in the preceding
month.

manufacturing declined 9.3 percent annually in March, following a 5.8
percent fall in February.

During January to March period, orders decreased by 5.6 percent compared
to the same period last year.
