The Australian [economy][1] is set to log its biggest contraction in the
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) due to the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic, the Reserve Bank
of Australia said Friday.  
  
In its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, the central bank said
gross domestic product is expected to contract around 10 percent over
the first half of 2020, mostly concentrated in the June quarter. The
decline in the June quarter will be the biggest on record, the bank
noted.

In order to combat the downturn caused by the pandemic, the bank had
reduced its key interest rate to 0.25 percent and unveiled a
quantitative easing programme in March.

Despite monetary and fiscal easing, the bank sees a sharp increase in
the unemployment rate to around 10 percent, the highest since 1994.

Due to falling oil prices, headline inflation is expected to fall by
around 2.25 percent in the June quarter and headline inflation is
expected to be negative in year-ended [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) for the first time since the
early 1960s.

The bank said the outlook beyond the June quarter is uncertain as the
recovery depends on how long social distancing measures remain in place.

The economy is forecast to rebound 7 percent in the year ending June
2021 and expand 5 percent in 2022.

Headline inflation is forecast to rise to 2.75 percent in the year
ending June 2021 but to slow to 1.5 percent in June 2022.

Like other major central banks, RBA also considered different scenarios
for the domestic recovery based on a range of plausible [health][2]
outcomes and the associated [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) responses.

The bank said the outcomes for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation in
the 'gradual recovery' baseline scenario were broadly in line with the
average market forecasts for these variables in 2020 and 2021.
