German exports declined at a record pace in March as widespread lockdown
to contain the spread of [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, across major
economies hurt the demand, official data showed Friday.

Exports fell by seasonally adjusted 11.8 percent month-on-month, in
contrast to February's 1.2 percent rise, Destatis reported.

This was the strongest decline since the beginning of the time series in
August 1990. Economists had forecast a monthly decrease of 5 percent in
March.

Likewise, imports dropped 5.1 percent on month, the largest fall since
January 2009. Economists had forecast imports to drop 4 percent after
easing1.5 percent in February.

Consequently, the trade surplus declined to a seasonally adjusted EUR
12.8 billion from EUR 21.4 billion a month ago.

On a yearly basis, exports and imports decreased 7.9 percent and 4.5
percent respectively.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus fell to EUR 17.4 billion from
EUR 22.3 billion in the same period last year.

The current account showed a surplus of EUR 24.4 billion versus EUR 30.9
billion last year.

Data showed that exports to the EU countries fell 11.0 percent and
imports from these countries decreased 8.0 percent. Shipments to euro
area countries were down 14 percent and imports from these economies
fell 7.8 percent.

A survey conducted by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or
DIHK, showed that 60 percent of companies suffer from lower demand and
43 percent from canceled orders.

Half of the survey participants were either completely or partially
closed due to the lockdown. Companies that are still closed expect to
start their [business][2] again immediately or within next two weeks.
