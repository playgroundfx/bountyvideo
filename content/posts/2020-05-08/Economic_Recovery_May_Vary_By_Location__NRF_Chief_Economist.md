The National Retail Federation's Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz believes
the economic recovery in the United States from the Coronavirus crisis
would come gradually and may vary by location depending on the severity.

His remark comes as more and more stores are reopening across the
country after at least 30 U.S. states began easing lockdown restrictions
and decided to reopen businesses despite soaring [coronavirus][1]
deaths.

In the May issue of NRF's Monthly Economic Review, Kleinhenz noted that
the [economy][2] should begin a process of gradual recovery now assuming
the coronavirus does not come back.

Kleinhenz said, "Getting back to work or shopping in a pre-virus manner
is difficult to predict at this time, with households likely to tiptoe
back in rather than making an immediate return to the lives they
experienced before....My overall impression is that the recovery will
have fits and starts among states, regions and cities depending on the
severity of the pandemic in their localities."

The pandemic has wreaked havoc on the U.S. and global economies and it
could take several months to assess the full consequences and project a
path forward.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, U.S. gross domestic product shrank
4.8 percent, hit by the coronavirus crisis, after an annualized growth
rate of 2.1 percent at the end of 2019. NRF, the world's largest retail
trade association, said it was the largest drop since 8.4 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2008 during the Great Recession.

In March, retail sales fell 8.7 percent from February, the worst month-
over-month drop on record. Consumer spending declined an annualized 7.6
percent during the first quarter, the largest drop since the second
quarter of 1980.

According to Kleinhenz, the recent decline is likely just a murmur of
the destruction the pandemic has created on the U.S. economy, while much
deeper contraction is expected during the second quarter.

The retail industry has been hit unevenly as stores that remain open
have had customers for essential goods, while those closed temporarily
have to struggle.

Amid the ongoing crisis, retailers Gap, Inc. Thursday said it plans to
re-open up to 800 stores by the end of May, while Kohl's Corp. intends
to reopen stores in 10 states on May 11. The company, which opened
stores in four states earlier this week, said it will open additional
Kohl's stores in the coming weeks.

Meanwhile, Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon has predicted that pickup and
home delivery will now become the "new normal" as the retail industry
will change significantly due to the coronavirus pandemic.
