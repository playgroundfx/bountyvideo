Reflecting the effects of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic and efforts to
contain it, the Labor Department released a report on Friday showing a
record nosedive in employment in the U.S. in the month of April.

The report said non-farm employment plummeted by 20.5 million jobs in
April after tumbling by a revised 870,000 jobs in March.

The steep drop in employment was not as bad as feared, however, as
economists had expected employment to plunge by 22.0 million jobs
compared to the loss of 701,000 jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

Nonetheless, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate still
skyrocketed to a post-World War II record high of 14.7 percent in April
from 4.4 percent in March. Economists had expected the unemployment to
spike to 14.0 percent.
