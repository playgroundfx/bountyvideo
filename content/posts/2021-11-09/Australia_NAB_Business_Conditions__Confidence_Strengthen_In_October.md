Australia [business][1] conditions and confidence strengthened in
October as lockdowns came to an end in both NSW and Victoria, survey
results from National Australia Bank showed on Tuesday.

The business conditions index advanced to 11 from 5.0 in September. All
components of conditions rebounded, with trading conditions posting the
strongest growth.

Similarly, the business confidence indicator improved to 21 from 10 a
month ago. Retail, business, finance and property, and personal and
recreation services all saw large confidence improvements, the survey
showed.  
  
"There is still scope for things to improve further in coming months,
particularly in Victoria, but overall this is an encouraging result with
conditions back above their long-run average," NAB chief economist Alan
Oster.

Conditions should continue to improve as vaccination rates rise and
restrictions ease further, said Oster.
