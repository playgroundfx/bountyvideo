France's external trade deficit increased in September, data from
customs office revealed on Tuesday.

The visible trade deficit widened to EUR 6.77 billion from EUR 6.65
billion in August. In the same period last year, the shortfall was EUR
5.69 billion.

Exports decreased 0.9 percent on a monthly basis in September, but
advanced 15.4 percent from September 2020.

Likewise, imports dropped 0.5 percent on month. Year-on-year imports
were up 13.8 percent.

As a three-month moving average, the balance of foreign trade in goods
continued to deteriorate slightly in September, under the effect of the
more marked growth in imports. The deficit stood at EUR 6.9 billion.
