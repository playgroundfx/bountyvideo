Estonia's trade balance swung to deficit in September, figures from
Statistics Estonia showed on Tuesday.

The trade balance registered a deficit of EUR 75 million in September
versus a surplus of EUR 18 million in the same month last year. In
August, the trade deficit was EUR 117 million.

Exports grew 30.0 percent year-on-year in September, following a 45.0
percent rise in August.

Imports rose 37.0 percent yearly in September, after a 41.0 percent
growth in the previous month.

"In September, trade figures reached a new record. Export and import
values are the highest ever: this is connected with continuing price
increases as well as growth in trade volumes," Evelin Puura, leading
analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.
