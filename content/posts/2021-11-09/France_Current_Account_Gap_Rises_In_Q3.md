France's current account deficit widened in the third quarter largely
due to the increase in the visible trade gap, the Bank of France
reported Tuesday.

The current account deficit totaled EUR 7.6 billion compared to a
shortfall of EUR 4.1 billion in the second quarter.

The trade in goods showed a deficit of EUR 18.5 billion, bigger than the
second quarter's EUR 13.9 billion deficit. On the other hand, the
surplus on services trade increased to EU 10.2 billion from EUR 8.5
billion in the prior quarter.

Primary and secondary income totaled EUR 0.7 billion versus EUR 1.3
billion in the second quarter.

The shortfall on financial account balance rose to -EUR 33.1 billion
from -EUR 18.0 billion in the second quarter.

In September 2021, the current account deficit stood at EUR 2.7 billion,
a deterioration of EUR 1.3 billion compared to August, data showed.
