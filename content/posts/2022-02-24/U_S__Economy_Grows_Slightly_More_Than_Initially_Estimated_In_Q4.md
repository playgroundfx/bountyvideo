The U.S. [economy][1] grew by slightly more than originally estimated in
the fourth quarter of 2021, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department on Thursday.

The report showed the increase in real gross domestic product in the
fourth quarter was upwardly revised to 7.0 percent from the previously
reported 6.9 percent. The upward revision matched economist estimates.

The jump in GDP in the fourth quarter reflected a significant
acceleration from the 2.3 percent increase in the third quarter.

"The U.S. economy is still displaying solid underlying fundamentals, but
it is facing rising headwinds from a negative fiscal impulse and
significant [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening by the Federal Reserve to combat high
inflation," said Lydia Boussour, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

She added, "Moreover, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is adding uncertainty
to the inflation, equity market and economic outlook and risks fueling
higher inflation and tighter financial conditions."

The stronger than previously estimated GDP growth in the fourth quarter
primarily reflected upward revisions to non-residential fixed
investment, state and local government spending, and residential fixed
investment.

The Commerce Department noted the upward revisions were partly offset by
downward revisions to consumer spending and exports.

The sharp increase in GDP in the fourth quarter was partly due to a
massive surge in [business][2] inventories, which added 4.9 percentage
points, the second largest contribution since 1987.

The report also consumer spending growth accelerated to 3.1 percent in
the fourth quarter from 2.0 percent in the third quarter, although the
jump was downwardly revised from 3.3 percent.

The GDP growth also reflected increases in exports and non-residential
fixed investment that were partly offset by decreases in government
spending and an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the
calculation of GDP.

With regard to inflation, the report showed the annual rate of growth in
core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, accelerated to 4.6
percent in the fourth quarter from 3.6 percent in third quarter.

"With recent inflation readings greatly exceeding expectations, we
believed the Fed should kick off its tightening cycle with a 50 basis
point rate hike in March," said Boussour.

"However, the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine likely leads
to a more conservative 25 basis point rate lift-off," she added. "The
Russian invasion also introduces downside potential to our forecast for
a total of 175 basis points of tightening this year."
