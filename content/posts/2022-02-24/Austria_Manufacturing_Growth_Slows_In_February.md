Austria's manufacturing sector growth slowed in February following a
strong upturn at the start of the year, survey results from IHS Markit
showed on Thursday.

The headline UniCredit Bank Austria manufacturing Purchasing Managers'
Index fell to 58.4 in February from 61.5 in January.

Although the index dropped from January, the score remained firmly above
the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction.  
  
Output growth slowed notably from January's four-month high as there was
a temporary reduction in staffing capacity linked to Covid-related
absences. Another factor was a softer rise in new orders. Here, the rate
of growth eased for the first time in three months.

There was a continued build-up of backlogs of work at Austrian
manufacturers owing to ongoing supply and capacity constraints.

Factory job creation continued to run at a sharp pace, supported by
strong optimism.

On the price front, the survey showed that the rates of inflation in
input costs and output prices eased further from the record highs seen
in the second half of 2021 to the lowest for twelve and ten months
respectively.

Manufacturers generally remained optimistic about growth prospects in
the year ahead but their expectations ticked down slightly since
January.
