Hong Kong's merchandise exports and imports increased at a softer pace
in January and the trade balance swung to a surplus, data from the
Census and Statistics Department showed on Thursday.

Exports rose 18.4 percent year-on-year in January, after a 24.8 percent
increase in December.

Imports gained 9.6 percent annually in January, after a 19.3 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade balance registered a surplus of HK$6.648 billion in January
versus a deficit of HK$25.288 billion in the same month last year. In
December, the deficit was HK$32.753 billion.

"Looking ahead, the continued revival of external demand should render
support to Hong Kong's export performance," a government spokesman said.
