Australia's private capital expenditure grew less than expected in the
fourth quarter but firms plan to raise their investment in 2022-23, data
released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday.

Total capital expenditure grew 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, but
slower than the economists' forecast of 2.6 percent.

Investment in buildings and structures was up 2.2 percent, while
equipment, plant and machinery investment fell 0.1 percent.

On a yearly basis, total capex expanded 9.8 percent in the fourth
quarter.

According to the fifth estimate for 2021-22, total capital expenditure
was A$140.8 billion, up 1.6 percent from the fourth estimate.

At the same time, capex for 2022-23 was 10.8 percent higher than the
first estimate for 2021-22.

The key point is that while firms may not have grown investment in Q4,
they plan to lift capital spending in the years ahead, said Ben Udy, an
economist at Capital Economics.

The [business][1] mood was generally upbeat throughout 2021, albeit with
brief setbacks when virus case numbers spiked, Andrew Hanlan, a senior
economist at Westpac said. Firms have been increasing investment
spending, particularly on equipment.

They are responding to underlying strength in demand, limited spare
capacity, mainly in the goods sectors, and generous government tax
incentives, the economist added.
