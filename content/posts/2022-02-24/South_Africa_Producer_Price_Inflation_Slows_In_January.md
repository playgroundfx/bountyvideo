South Africa's producer price inflation eased in January, but remained
strong, figures from Statistics South Africa showed on Thursday.

The producer price index rose 10.1 percent year-on-year in January,
after a 10.8 percent increase in December. Economists had expected
inflation to rise 10.5 percent.

The main contribution for the increase in prices came from coke,
petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic products, metals, machinery,
equipment and computing equipment, and food products, beverages and
tobacco products in January.

Producer prices for the mining industry gained 6.4 percent annually in
January and prices for electricity and water increased 16.1 percent.

Prices for agriculture, forestry and fishing, and intermediate goods
rose by 6.9 percent and 21.0 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.2 percent in January.
Economists had forecast a rise of 0.4 percent.
