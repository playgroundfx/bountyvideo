The U.S. [economy][1] grew by slightly more than originally estimated in
the fourth quarter of 2021, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department on Thursday.

The report showed the increase in real gross domestic product in the
fourth quarter was upwardly revised to 7.0 percent from the previously
reported 6.9 percent. The upward revision matched economist estimates.

The stronger than previously estimated growth primarily reflected upward
revisions to non-residential fixed investment, state and local
government spending, and residential fixed investment.

The Commerce Department noted the upward revisions were partly offset by
downward revisions to consumer spending and exports.
