A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time
claims for U.S. unemployment benefits fell by slightly more than
expected in the week ended February 19th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims dropped to 232,000, a
decrease of 17,000 from the previous week's revised level 249,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 235,000 from the
248,000 originally reported for the previous week.

"We expect initial claims to continue to grind back toward 200k as the
impact of the Omicron variant of the [coronavirus][1] fades," said Nancy
Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Layoffs are expected to be minimal in a tight labor market
where employers continue to struggle to attract workers."

The report showed the less volatile four-week moving average also edged
down to 236,250, a decrease of 7,250 from the previous week's revised
average of 243,500.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also slid by 112,000 to 1.476 million in the
week ended February 12th, hitting the lowest level since March of 1970.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also fell to a nearly
50-year low of 1,576,000, a decrease of 49,000 from the previous week's
revised average or 1,625,000.

"Continued claims have been consistently below the pre-pandemic average
of 1.71 million and are expected to remain at low levels as [health][2]
conditions improve and more workers return to the labor market," said
Vanden Houten.

Next Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more
closely watched report on the employment situation in the month of
February.

Economists currently expect employment to increase by 400,000 jobs in
February after climbing by 467,000 jobs in January, while the
unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 3.9 percent from 4.0
percent.
