South Korea's central bank maintained its key interest rate after two
back-to-back rate hikes, amid rising geopolitical risks and surging
[coronavirus][1] infections.

The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided to leave its base
rate unchanged at 1.25 percent, as expected, on Thursday.

The bank had raised its key rate by 25 basis points each in November and
January. The board today said it will judge when to further adjust the
degree of accommodation.

Today's decision to hold its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate is likely to mark a pause
rather than an end to the tightening cycle, Alex Holmes, an economist at
Capital Economics, said. The BoK is likely to resume its tightening
cycle at its meeting on April 14.

In a separate report, the central bank lifted its inflation forecast for
2022 to 3.1 percent from 2.0 percent due to rising energy and raw
material prices and global supply bottlenecks. For 2023, inflation is
seen at 2 percent.

Core inflation for items other than food and energy is forecast to stand
at 2.6 percent this year and 2.0 percent next year.

The [economy][2] is likely to sustain its sound growth, as the recovery
of private consumption is forecast to gradually pick up again while
exports are expected to continue their solid trend of increase, the bank
said.

GDP growth is projected to be around 3 percent this year, not deviating
greatly from the November forecast. Growth is expected to slow slightly
to 2.5 percent in 2023.
