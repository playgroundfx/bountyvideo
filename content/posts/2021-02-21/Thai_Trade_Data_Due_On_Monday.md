Thailand will on Monday release January figures for imports, exports and
trade balance, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

Imports are expected to sink 10.5 percent on year after rising 3.62
percent in December. Exports are called higher by an annual 2.4 percent
after adding 4.7 percent in the previous month. The trade surplus is
pegged at $0.1 billion, down from $0.96 billion a month earlier.

China will provide February data on prime loan rates; in January, the
one-year rate was 3.85 percent and the five-year rate was 4.65 percent.

Hong Kong will see January figures for consumer prices; in December,
overall inflation was down 0.7 percent on year.
