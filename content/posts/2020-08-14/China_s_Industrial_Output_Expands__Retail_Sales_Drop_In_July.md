China industrial production grew at a steady pace in July, while retail
sales logged an unexpected fall as social distancing and floods weighed
on consumption, data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed
Friday.

Industrial production grew 4.8 percent on a yearly basis in July, the
same rate of growth as seen in June. This was the fourth consecutive
decrease. However, the rate was weaker than the expected rise of 5.1
percent.

At the same time, retail sales dropped 1.1 percent from last year,
confounding expectations for an increase of 0.1 percent. Sales had
declined 1.8 percent in June.

During January to July period, fixed asset investment decreased 1.6
percent versus a 3.1 percent decrease in January to June. The rate came
in line with expectations.  
  
At 5.7 percent, the unemployment rate was unchanged from June.

In general, the national [economy][1] continued to recover steadily in
July, and major economic indicators continued to improve, the NBS said.
However, the coronavirus epidemic is still spreading globally.

The international economic environment is severe and complex, the NBS
added.

Rebounding from the unprecedented downturn posed by the [coronavirus][2]
pandemic, China's economy had expanded 3.2 percent in the second
quarter, after contracting 6.8 percent in the first quarter.

A slowdown in China's economic recovery was always likely at some point
as the initial boost from re-opening faded, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an
economist at Capital Economics, noted.

The economist still anticipates a further gradual improvement in
activity in the coming months on the back of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support.

Economic growth will not be as fast as it would have been if the rest of
the world recovered from Covid-19 and export demand picked up, Iris
Pang, an ING economist said.
