Portugal's [economy][1] contracted slightly less than initially
estimated, but the rate of decline remained sharp, amid the severe hit
from the coronavirus pandemic, latest figures from Statistics Portugal
showed on Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product fell 16.3 percent year-on-year, which was
initially estimated at 16.5 percent. In the first quarter, the economy
shrank 2.3 percent.  
  
Two consecutive quarters of economic contraction equals to a technical
recession.  
  
Domestic demand made a negative contribution of 11.9 percentage points,
which was far worse than the 1.2 percentage points in the previous
quarter.  
  
This was largely due to the sharp contraction in private consumption and
investment due to the containment measures implemented to battle the
Covid-19.

Negative contribution of external demand worsened to 4.4 percentage
points as exports declined more than imports, due largely to the near
interruption of non-residents tourism, the statistical office said.  
  
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP fell 13.9 percent after a 3.8 percent
drop in the previous quarter. The quarterly decline was initially
estimated as 14.1 percent.
