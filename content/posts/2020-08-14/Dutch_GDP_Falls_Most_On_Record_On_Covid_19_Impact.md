The Netherlands' [economy][1] shrank at a record pace in the second
quarter and entered a severe recession, due to the impact of the
coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic, preliminary estimates from the
Central Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product decreased 8.5 percent sequentially after a 1.5
percent decline in the first quarter. Economists had forecast a 9.2
percent fall.

This is the largest quarterly decline on record and more than half of it
was attributable to the nosedive in household consumption, while
investments in fixed assets and the trade balance also decreased
sharply, the CBS said.

Previously, the sharpest quarterly decline was 3.6 percent in the first
quarter of 2009 during the global financial crisis.

Household spending dropped 10.4 percent and investments decreased 12.4
percent. Exports and imports fell 9.8 and 8.3 percent, respectively.
Public consumption declined 3 percent.

Weakness in sectors such as trade, transport, accommodation and food
services and storage as well as [business][2] services including travel
services, and care all contributed significantly to the economic
decline.  
  
In the [health][3] care sector, the lower productivity was mainly due to
the fact that many health and care services were postponed or avoided
during the Covid-19 crisis.

On a year-on-year basis, GDP fell 9.3 percent in the second quarter
after a 0.2 percent drop in the previous three months. Economists had
expected a 9.7 percent decline.  
  
The latest annual fall was also a record, surpassing the 4.6 percent
decline logged in the second quarter of 2009.
