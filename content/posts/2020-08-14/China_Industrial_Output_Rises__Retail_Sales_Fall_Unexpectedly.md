China's industrial production increased in July, while retail sales
logged an unexpected fall, data from the National Bureau of Statistics
revealed Friday.

Industrial production grew 4.8 percent on a yearly basis in July, the
same rate of growth as seen in June. However, the rate was weaker than
the expected rise of 5.1 percent.

At the same time, retail sales dropped 1.1 percent from last year,
confounding expectations for an increase of 0.1 percent. Sales had
declined 1.8 percent in June.

During January to July period, fixed asset investment decreased 1.6
percent versus a 3.1 percent decrease in January to June. The rate came
in line with expectations.
