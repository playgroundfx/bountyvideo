Denmark's [economy][1] shrunk at a record pace in the second quarter of
2020 to enter a technical recession, due to the disruption caused by the
coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic, preliminary figures from Statistics
Denmark showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product decreased 7.4 percent from the first quarter,
when the economy contracted 2 percent. Two consecutive quarters of GDP
decline qualifies as a technical recession.

This will be by far the largest decline since the compilation of the
quarterly national accounts began in the early 1990s, the statistical
office said.

The latest decline is much larger than the previous record fall of 2.4
percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. The GDP is now down to the level
at the start of 2016, the statistical office said.

The start of the second quarter was significantly affected by the
partial shutdown of society in March, after which the gradual reopening
lead to generally higher production towards the end of the quarter, the
statistical office added.

Employment dropped 3.1 percent in the second quarter, which was also a
record fall.

The industrial sector has been severely hit by the pandemic and large
negative contributions came from the services sector which includes
trade, transport, hotels and restaurants, culture and leisure sub-
sectors.

Agriculture, raw material extraction, finance and construction were less
affected by COVID-19.

Despite the record fall, the Danish economy has fared better than most
other countries in the EU who witnessed double-digit decline in national
output, the statistical office said.
