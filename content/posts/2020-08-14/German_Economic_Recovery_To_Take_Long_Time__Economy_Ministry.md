The German economic recovery is likely to take a long time, the
[economy][1] ministry said in its monthly report, released Friday.

The economy has started to recover since May. The ministry said gross
domestic product will recover strongly in the third quarter.

However, the recovery process will be slow and take a long time to
complete, the ministry added.

In the second quarter, the largest euro area economy had contracted at a
record pace of 10.1 percent as the [coronavirus][2] pandemic took its
toll on exports, domestic consumption and investment.
