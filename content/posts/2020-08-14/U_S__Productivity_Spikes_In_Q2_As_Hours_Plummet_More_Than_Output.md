Labor productivity in the U.S. soared by much more than expected in the
second quarter, according to a report released by the Labor Department
on Friday.

The report said labor productivity spiked by 7.3 percent in the second
quarter after dipping by a revised 0.3 percent in the first quarter.

Economists had expected labor productivity to jump by 1.5 percent
compared to the 0.9 percent decrease that had been reported for the
previous quarter.

The much bigger than expected increase in productivity, a measure of
output per hour, came as hours worked plummeted by even more than
output.

Hours worked plunged by 43.0 percent in the second quarter after
slumping by 6.1 percent in the first quarter, while output cratered by
38.9 percent after tumbling by 6.4 percent.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said unit labor costs skyrocketed by
12.2 percent in the second quarter after surging up by 9.8 percent in
the first quarter.

Economists had expected unit labor costs to spike by 6.2 percent
compared to the 5.1 percent surge that had been reported for the
previous quarter.

Unit labor costs showed the biggest increase since the first quarter of
2014, as hourly compensation soared by 20.4 percent in the second
quarter after jumping by 9.4 percent in the first quarter.

Real hourly compensation, which takes into account changes in consumer
prices, spiked by 24.8 percent in the second quarter after surging up by
8.1 percent in the previous quarter.
