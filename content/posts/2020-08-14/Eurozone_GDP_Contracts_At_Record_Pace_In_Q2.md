The euro area [economy][1] contracted at a record pace in the second
quarter, as initially estimated, due to the containment measures taken
by member countries to control the spread of the coronavirus, flash
estimate from Eurostat showed Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 12.1 percent sequentially in the second
quarter, following a 3.6 percent drop in the first quarter. This was the
sharpest decline seen since the series began in 1995.

Year-on-year, GDP was down 15 percent versus a 3.1 percent decline a
quarter ago. This was also the sharpest decrease since 1995.

Both quarterly and annual rates matched the preliminary estimate
released on July 31.  
  
Data showed that employment dropped 2.8 percent from the previous
quarter, the biggest since the series began in 1995. Employment was down
0.2 percent in the first quarter.

On a yearly basis, employment decreased 2.9 percent versus a 0.4 percent
rise in the preceding period.

Another report from Eurostat showed that the trade surplus nearly
doubled in June from the previous month as the growth in exports far
exceeded the rise in imports.

The trade surplus rose to a seasonally adjusted EUR 17.1 billion from
EUR 8.6 billion in May.

Exports increased 11.2 percent on month and imports grew 5.7 percent in
June.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus exports and imports decreased
10 percent and 12.2 percent annually, respectively.  
  
As a result, the trade surplus totaled EUR 21.2 billion versus EUR 19.4
billion last year.
