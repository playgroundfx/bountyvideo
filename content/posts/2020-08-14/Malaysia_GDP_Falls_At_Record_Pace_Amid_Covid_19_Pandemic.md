Malaysia's [economy][1] shrank at a record pace in the second quarter
due to the unprecedented impact of the stringent containment measures to
contain the coronavirus pandemic, data from the Department of Statistics
showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product dropped 17.1 percent year-on-year in the second
quarter, after a 0.7 percent rise in the first quarter. This was also
bigger than the expected fall of 10.0 percent.

The performance for this quarter was the lowest recorded since the
fourth quarter of 1998, when GDP was down 11.2 percent, the statistical
office said.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy shrank a seasonally adjusted
16.5 percent in the second quarter, following a 2.0 percent fall in the
preceding period. The second consecutive decline has taken the economy
into a technical recession.

The central bank downgraded its growth projections for this year as
nationwide movement control order restricted production and consumption.

The economy is forecast to contract in the range of -3.5 percent to -5.5
percent this year versus previous outlook of +0.5 percent to -2 percent.

However, the economy is expected to rebound next year underpinned by the
recovery in global growth and continued domestic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures. GDP is
expected to grow 5.5 percent to 8 percent range next year.

Average headline inflation in 2020 is likely to be negative, in line
with the earlier projected range of -1.5 percent to 0.5 percent, the
bank said.

For 2021, headline inflation is forecast to average higher, between 1
percent and 3 percent driven by the expected recovery in global oil
prices and improvement in domestic demand conditions.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household spending declined
sharply by 18.5 percent annually, in contrast to a 6.7 percent rise in
the preceding period.

Although government spending grew 2.3 percent, this was slower than the
5 percent rise posted in the first quarter.

Gross fixed capital formation fell 28.9 percent versus a moderate 4.6
percent decrease a quarter ago.

Exports and imports decreased by 21.7 percent and 19.7 percent,
respectively, in the second quarter. In the first quarter, exports had
declined 7.1 percent and imports by 2.5 percent.

On the production-side, all main sectors except agriculture expanded in
the second quarter. Services shrank 16.2 percent and manufacturing
contracted 18.3 percent. Construction output plunged 44.5 percent and
mining declined 20 percent.
