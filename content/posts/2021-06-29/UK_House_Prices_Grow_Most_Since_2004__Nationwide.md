UK house prices grew at the fastest pace in more than six years in June
largely due to the low base of comparison, data from the Nationwide
Building Society showed on Tuesday.

House prices grew 13.4 percent on a yearly basis in June, the biggest
outturn since November, 2004. Economists had forecast prices to climb
13.7 percent after rising 10.9 percent in May.

While the strength is partly due to base effects, with June last year
unusually weak due to the first lockdown, the market continues to show
significant momentum, Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist,
said.

Month-on-month, house price growth eased to 0.7 percent in June from 1.7
percent in May. Prices in June were almost 5 percent higher than in
March.

Despite house prices rising to new all-time highs, mortgage payment is
not high by historic standards, largely because mortgage rates remained
close to record lows.

Underlying demand is likely to remain solid in the near term as the
[economy][1] unlocks, Gardner said. Improving consumer confidence, low
borrowing cost combined with the lack of supply on the market suggested
further upward pressure on prices.

Nevertheless, underlying demand is likely to soften around the turn of
the year if unemployment rises as most analysts expect, as government
support schemes wind down, added Gardner.

In the second quarter, there were a considerable pick up in overall
house price growth. House prices advanced 3.7 percent sequentially and
by 10.3 percent from the last year.
