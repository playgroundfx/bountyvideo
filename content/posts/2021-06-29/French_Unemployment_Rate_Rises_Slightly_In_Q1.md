France's unemployment rate rose marginally in the first quarter, data
released by the statistical office Insee showed on Tuesday.

The ILO jobless rate rose slightly to 8.1 percent in the first quarter
from 8 percent in the fourth quarter.

The rate was 0.3 points above its previous year level earlier and
returned to its level at the end of 2019, before the [health][1] crisis.

In the first quarter, the unemployment rate among youth aged between 15
and 24 rose to 20.9 percent from 19.7 percent in the previous quarter.

At the beginning of 2021, the virtual stability in the unemployment rate
was the result of both the stability of the employment rate and
persistent withdrawal behavior from the labor market, due to the crisis
and the ongoing sanitary restrictions, the Insee said.
