posting a sharp rebound in April.

Consumer price inflation eased to 2.6 percent in June from 2.7 percent

Food and non-alcoholic beverages prices grew at a faster pace of 1.1

On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.4 percent versus 0.5
percent in the previous month.

Inflation based on the harmonized index of consumer prices, remained
unchanged at 2.4 percent, as expected, in June. Month-on-month, the HICP

In a separate communiqu√©, the INE said retail sales growth moderated to
an adjusted 19.6 percent in May from 40.5 percent in April.

On an unadjusted basis, retail sales grew 18.8 percent compared to 38.3

Month-on-month, retail sales remained flat after easing 0.5 percent in
April. Food and non-food product sales decreased 2.9 percent and 0.4
