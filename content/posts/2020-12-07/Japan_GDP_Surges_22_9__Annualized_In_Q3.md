Japan's gross domestic product spiked an annualized 22.9 percent in the
third quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.

That beat expectations for an increase of 21.5 percent following the
28.8 percent plunge in the previous three months.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was up 5.0 percent - matching forecasts
following the 8.2 percent decline in the three months prior.

Capital expenditure was down 2.4 percent on quarter, exceeding
expectations for a decline of 3.2 percent following the 4.5 percent fall
in the second quarter.
