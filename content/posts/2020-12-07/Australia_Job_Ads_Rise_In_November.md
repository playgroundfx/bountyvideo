Australia's job advertisement grew in November, data released by ANZ
showed Monday.

Job Ads increased 13.9 percent month-on-month in November, following an
upwardly revised 11.9 percent rise in October. But the rate remained 4.7
percent lower than the February level.

Victoria's reopening led to an increase in the job ads recovery through
October and November, with ads rising 27.0 percent over the two-month
period, ANZ Senior Economist, Catherine Birch said.

"Our Australia-wide high frequency indicator shows activity has risen to
just shy of its trend level and Victorian spending has surged," said
Birch. "We expect this will translate into further significant
employment gains in Victoria in the near-term, following the 87k rise in
October."
