Estonia's consumer prices decreased in November, data from Statistics
Estonia showed on Monday.

The consumer price index fell 1.1 percent year-on-year in November,
following a 1.5 percent decrease in October.

Compared to the previous year, the consumer price index was affected the
most by the decline in prices of motor fuel, Viktoria Trasanov, leading
analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.

Diesel fuel prices declined 26.9 percent and petrol prices fell 9.1
percent.

"Housing services also had a bigger impact, half of which can be
attributed to the 2.6% price decrease of electricity, heat energy and
heating," Trasanov added.

Prices for transportation decreased 7.3 percent annually in November and
those of housing fell 2.8 percent.

Prices for clothing and footwear fell 1.2 percent and miscellaneous
goods and services decreased 0.4 percent. Prices for hotels, cafes and
restaurants, and communications declined 1.7 percent and 2.3 percent,
respectively.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in November, after
a 0.5 percent decline in the previous month.
