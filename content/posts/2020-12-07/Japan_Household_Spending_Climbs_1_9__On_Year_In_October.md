The average of household spending in Japan was up 1.9 percent on year in
October, the Ministry of Communications and Internal Affairs said on
Tuesday - coming in at 283,508 yen.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 2.5 percent following
the 10.2 percent plunge in September.

On a monthly basis, household spending climbed 2.1 percent - beating
expectations for a gain of 1 percent after rising 3.8 percent in the
previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 546,786 yen, up 2.5
percent on year.
