China's exports growth accelerated more-than-expected in November driven
by strong demand for electronic goods and medical equipments, official
data revealed Monday.

Exports advanced 21.1 percent on a yearly basis in November, the General
Administration of Customs reported. This was the biggest growth since
February 2018.

Economists had forecast shipments to grow 12 percent after rising 11.4
percent in October.

At the same time, imports grew moderately by 4.5 percent annually, which
was faster than the 6.1 percent increase expected by economists but
slower than the 4.7 percent increase logged in October.

As a result, the trade surplus increased to $75.4 billion in November.
Economists had forecast the surplus to fall to $53.5 billion from $58.44
billion in the previous month.

China's trade surplus with the United States was $37.42 billion in
November.

According to Purchasing Managers' survey, China's manufacturing sector
grew the most in a decade in November. Orders for manufactured goods
continued to grow led by firmer domestic demand. Growth in new export
work was not as marked as that seen for total orders.

Last week, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
said the activity in China would to return to its past trajectory, with
growth of 8 percent in 2021 and 4.9 percent in 2022.
