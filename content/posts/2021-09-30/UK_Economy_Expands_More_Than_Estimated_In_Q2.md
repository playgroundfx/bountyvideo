The UK [economy][1] grew more than initially estimated in the second
quarter on robust consumption, revised data from the Office for National
Statistics showed on Thursday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 5.5 percent sequentially instead of 4.8
percent growth estimated previously. The expansion has reversed first
quarter's 1.4 percent contraction.

Consequently, the level of GDP was now 3.3 percent below where it was
prior to the pandemic at the end of 2019, revised from the previous
estimate of 4.4 percent.

Overall, while the upward revisions to GDP are clearly welcome, the
second quarter was three months ago, and the recovery appears to have
stagnated since, Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

"Even so, given that there is now thought to be less spare capacity in
the economy that will only encourage the Bank of England to hike rates
in the not too distant future," the economist noted.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household spending
contributed the most in the second quarter. Household spending surged by
revised 7.2 percent after falling 4.4 percent. The rate was revised down
from +7.3 percent.

Government consumption climbed 8.1 percent, upwardly revised from a
first estimate of 6.1 percent.

At the same time, gross fixed capital formation was up 0.8 percent, in
contrast to the 3 percent decline a quarter ago. The rate was revised a
0.5 percent fall in the first estimate. This upward revision was mainly
driven by [business][2] investment which increased 4.5 percent.

The trade balance was 0.1 percent of nominal GDP in the second quarter.

On the production-side, services, production, and construction output
all increased in the second quarter as [coronavirus][3] restrictions
continued to ease to varying degrees in England, Scotland and Wales.

There was an increase in services output of 6.5 percent in the second
quarter, revised upwards from a first estimate of 5.7 percent.

Production output rose 1.0 percent mainly driven by an unrevised 1.8
percent rise in manufacturing. Construction output increased by a
revised 3.8 percent and has now broadly recovered to its pre-pandemic
output level.

Another report from the ONS showed that the UK's current account balance
widened substantially in the second quarter as the deficit on both trade
and investment income increased.
