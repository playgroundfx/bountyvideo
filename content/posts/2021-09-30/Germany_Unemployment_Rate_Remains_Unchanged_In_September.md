Germany's unemployment rate remained unchanged in September, data
published by the Federal Labor Agency showed on Thursday.

The unemployment rate held steady at seasonally adjusted 5.5 percent in
September. The expected rate was 5.4 percent.

The number of unemployed decreased 30,000 in September from August, when
it was down 53,000. Economists had forecast a decline of 33,000.

The labor market continues to develop positively, Daniel Terzenbach of
the Federal Labor Agency said. Unemployment and underemployment are
falling sharply.

Employment and the number of jobs are growing and are again above their
respective pre-crisis levels, Terzenbach added.
