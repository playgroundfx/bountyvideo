First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased
for the third straight week in the week ended September 25th, according
to a report released by the Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims edged up to 362,000, an increase
of 11,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 351,000. The
uptick surprised economists, who had expected jobless claims to dip to
335,000.

With the unexpected increase, jobless claims climbed further off the
pandemic-era low of 312,000 set in the week ended September 4th.
