percent year-on-year. Manufactured product prices rose 7.2 percent.

Producer price inflation in the home market climbed to 10.0 percent from
9.0 percent in the previous month. Prices in the foreign market
increased 8.4 percent annually after a 7.1 percent increase in the
previous month.  
  
Compared to the previous month, industrial producer prices increased 0.9
percent after a 1.4 percent rise in the previous month. Domestic market
prices rose 1.0 percent after a 1.5 percent increase in the previous
month. Foreign market prices rose 0.6 percent after a 1.0 percent climb.
