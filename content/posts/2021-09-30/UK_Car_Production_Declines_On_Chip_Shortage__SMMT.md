UK car production declined sharply in August largely due to the global
shortage of semiconductors, data published by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, or SMMT, showed on Thursday.

Car output declined 27 percent year-on-year in August. This was the
second consecutive fall in production.

The lobby said global chip shortage as well as some extended summer
factory shutdowns dented overall performance.

Production for domestic market grew 3.3 percent, while that for foreign
market was down 32.5 percent. About 29,200 cars were shipped overseas,
with the decline driven by falling exports to faraway [markets][1]
including Australia, the US and China.

Production in the year-to-date remained up, by 13.8 percent, to 589,607
cars, driven by exports with 83.2 percent of everything made heading for
markets abroad.

Carmakers and their suppliers are battling to keep production lines
rolling with constraints expected to continue well into 2022 and
possibly beyond, Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said.
