Australia's job advertisement declined in August, data released by ANZ
showed on Monday.

Job Ads decreased 2.5 percent month-on-month in August, following an
downwardly revised 1.3 percent in July.

The latest decline was mainly due to lockdown for second month and
Vitoria entered its sixth month lockdown.

"Admittedly, it is likely that ANZ Job Ads will decline further over
coming months, and we expect sizeable employment losses in locked down
areas, with the national unemployment rate to lift back above 5
percent," ANZ Senior Economist, Catherine Birch, said.
