The UK construction sector growth slowed in August as restricted supply
of materials and transport began to weigh on overall activity, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing
Managers' Index fell to 55.2 in August from 58.7 in July. The reading
was also below economists' forecast of 56.9.

There were softer expansions across housebuilding, commercial work and
civil engineering activity. Commercial work was the best performing
broad category of construction output. Meanwhile, civil engineering
remained the slowest growing sub-sector.

Total new work increased for the fifteenth consecutive month in August.
But the pace of growth softened to the weakest since March.

Amid softer growth in new orders, the rate of job creation eased to a
four-month low in the latest survey period.

On the price front, the survey showed that input cost inflation
accelerated to the second fastest rate in the 24-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the
survey.

Looking ahead, construction companies remained highly upbeat about their
growth prospects over the coming 12 months.
