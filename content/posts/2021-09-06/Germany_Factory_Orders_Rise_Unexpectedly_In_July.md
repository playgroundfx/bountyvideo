Germany's factory orders grew unexpectedly in July driven by foreign
demand, data from Destatis revealed on Monday.

Factory orders grew 3.4 percent on a monthly basis, confounding
expectations for a decline of 1 percent. However, the pace of growth was
weaker than June's 4.6 percent.

New orders reached the highest level since the beginning of the time
series in 1991. The marked month-on-month increase was caused by major
orders, Destatis said.

Excluding major orders, there was a decline of 0.2 percent in July.

Domestic orders dropped 2.5 percent, while foreign orders went up 8.0
percent in July.

On a yearly basis, factory orders grew significantly by 24.4 percent in
July, following a 26.5 percent increase in June.

Real turnover in manufacturing grew 1.9 percent in July after expanding
5.7 percent in June.
