UK consumer sentiment strengthened more-than-expected in July to reach
ahead of its March 2020 pre-lockdown level, survey data from the market
research group GfK showed on Friday.

The consumer sentiment index rose to -7 in July from -9 in the previous
month. The expected reading was -8.

"This means it has now held firm or improved for six months in a row,"
Joe Staton, client strategy director GfK, said. "What happens across the
remaining summer months will frame consumer confidence for the rest of
2021 and beyond," Staton added.

Among components of the consumer sentiment index, two measures were up
in comparison to June, two measures were down and one stayed the same in
July.

The assessment of the past personal financial situation fell to -1 from
zero in June, while the outlook for the personal financial situation
held steady at 11.

Consumers' view about the past general economic situation climbed to -43
from -47, while expectations for the general economic conditions
worsened to -5 from -2.

At the same time, the major purchase index rose to +2 from -5 a month
ago.
