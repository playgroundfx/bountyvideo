Professional forecasts raised their inflation and growth projections for
the euro area, results of a quarterly survey by the European Central
Bank showed Friday.  
  
The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter showed
that HICP inflation expectation for this year was raised to 1.9 percent
from 1.6 percent in the previous round.  
  
The projection for next year was lifted to 1.5 percent from 1.3 percent.
The outlook for 2023 was retained at 1.5 percent.  
  
The longer term inflation expectation, which refers to 2026, was 1.8
percent versus 1.7 percent for 2025 in the second quarter survey.  
  
The projection for core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol
and tobacco, for this year was raised to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent.
The outlook for next year was lifted to 1.3 percent and that for the
year after was revised up to 1.5 percent.  
  
Longer term expectations for core inflation was 1.7 percent for 2026
versus 1.6 percent for 2025 in the previous survey.  
  
"Respondents once again confirmed that they considered some of the
factors behind the expected increase in inflation in 2021 to be
temporary but believed that underlying inflation pressure would
gradually rise as economic activity recovers," the ECB said.  
  
The Eurozone economic growth forecast for this year was raised to 4.7
percent from 4.2 percent. The outlook for next year was increased to 4.6
percent from 4.1 percent. The projection for 2023 was lifted to 2.1
percent from 1.9 percent.  
  
"These expectations imply that economic activity will surpass its pre-
pandemic level, which is the fourth quarter of 2019, in the fourth
quarter of 2021, one quarter earlier than previously expected," the bank
said.  
  
For 2026, the longer term growth expectation was 1.4 percent, same as
that for 2025 in the previous survey.  
  
The unemployment rate forecast for this year was lowered to 8.1 percent
from 8.5 percent. The projection for next year was cut to 7.8 percent
from 8.1 percent. The outlook for 2023 was lowered to 7.5 percent from
7.7 percent.  
  
The longer term expectation for unemployment was 7.2 percent for 2026
versus 7.4 percent for 2025 in the previous round.
