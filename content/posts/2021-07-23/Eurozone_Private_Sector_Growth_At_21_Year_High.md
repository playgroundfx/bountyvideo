The euro area private sector expanded at the fastest pace in 21 years in
July, as the member countries eased COVID-19 restrictions, flash survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

At 60.6, the composite output index hit a 252-month high in July, up
from 59.5 in June and economists' forecast of 60.0.

The services activity grew the most in 15 years, while growth in
manufacturing moderated to a four-month low due to worsening supply
lines.

The services sector in particular is enjoying the freedom of loosened
COVID-19 containment measures and improved vaccination rates, especially
in relation to hospitality, travel and tourism, Chris Williamson, chief
[business][1] economist at IHS Markit said.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to 60.4 from 58.3 in
June. The score was forecast to climb to 59.5.

On the other hand, the factory PMI dropped to 62.6 from 63.4 in the
previous month. The reading was expected to fall to consensus 62.5.

New orders across both the manufacturing and services accelerated to the
fastest since May 2000. Backlogs of work rose at a joint-survey record
rate amid capacity constraints.

Firms hired additional staff for a sixth straight month to meet the
upturn in demand. The net increase was the second-steepest since January
2018.

Prices charged for goods and services rose at a pace unseen prior to
June as demand again outstripped supply.

Meanwhile, business confidence took a hit from rising concerns over the
delta variant, pushing sentiment for the year ahead to a five-month low.

Within the Eurozone, Germany led the upturn, reporting the strongest
monthly expansion since comparable data were first available in January
1998. Meanwhile, the rate of expansion moderated to a three-month low in
France.

Germany's private sector growth was driven by an ongoing rapid recovery
in services activity. The composite output index rose to 62.5 in July
from 60.1 in June. The latest score was above economists' forecast of
60.8.

The services PMI advanced to a record 62.2 from 57.5 in the previous
month. The reading was expected to rise moderately to 59.1.

The manufacturing PMI came in at a three -month high of 65.6, up from
65.1 a month ago and economists' forecast of 64.2.

France's private sector remained strong in July but the pace of
expansion moderated from June. The flash composite output index dropped
unexpectedly to 56.8 in July from 57.4 in June. The score was forecast
to rise to 58.5.

Service sector output growth continued to surpass that seen in the
manufacturing sector amid looser lockdown restrictions.

The manufacturing PMI fell more-than-expected to 58.1 from 59.0 in June.
The expected score was 58.4. At the same time, the services PMI came in
at 57.0, down from 57.8 in June and the forecast of 58.7.
