The UK private sector growth slowed to a four-month low in July as the
shortages of staff and materials weighed on recovery, flash survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply composite output index
dropped more-than-expected to 57.7 from 62.2 in June. The reading was
seen falling to 61.9.

Nonetheless, the index has remained above the 50.0 no change level for
the fifth consecutive month in July.

The speed of recovery eased to the weakest since March, with survey
respondents widely reporting staff and raw material shortages due to the
pandemic.

"July saw the UK [economy][1]'s recent growth spurt stifled by the
rising wave of virus infections, which subdued customer demand,
disrupted supply chains and caused widespread staff shortages, and also
cast a darkening shadow over the outlook," Chris Williamson, chief
[business][2] economist at IHS Markit, said.

Largely reflecting weaker rates of output and new order growth, the
manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 60.4, down from 63.9
in June and also well below economists' forecast of 62.7.

The services PMI declined to 57.8 from 62.4 in the prior month. The
reading was expected to drop moderately to 62.0.

The fall in the composite PMI is not as worrying as it seems since the
largest gains following the easing of restrictions have already been
realized, Kieran Tompkins, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

But comments in the press release citing drags on growth from self-
isolations means that the resurgence of the virus is becoming a growing
downside risk to the forecast for GDP to return to its February 2020
level in October, the economist added.
