Malaysia's consumer prices inflation eased in June, data from the
Department of Statistics showed on Friday.

Consumer price inflation eased to 3.4 percent in June from 4.4 percent
in May. Economists had expected the inflation to rise 3.5 percent.

Prices rose for the fifth straight month since February, amid a lower
base effect as a result of the decline in fuel prices for private
vehicles, the agency said.

The annual growth was largely driven by the rise in prices of transport
by 16.6 percent.

Prices for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels rose 3.2
percent. Prices for furnishings, households equipment and routine
household maintenance rose 2.0 percent and prices for food and non-
alcoholic beverages gained 1.3 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in June.

The core inflation was 0.7 percent in June.

In the second quarter, consumer prices rose 0.5 percent quarterly.
