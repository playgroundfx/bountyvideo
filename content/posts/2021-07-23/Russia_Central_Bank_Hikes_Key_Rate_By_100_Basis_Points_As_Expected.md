Russia's central bank raised its key interest rate by 100 basis points
on Friday, to bring the inflation to the target.

The Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate to 6.50 percent
from 5.50 percent. The outcome of the meeting came in line with
economists' expectations.

The bank has lifted its benchmark rate by a cumulative 225 basis points
since March.

The central bank said, "The balance of risks remains significantly
shifted towards proinflationary ones." Policymakers viewed that high
inflation expectations may cause inflation to deviate upwards from the
target for a longer period.

Annual inflation is forecast to reach 5.7-6.2 percent this year. Given
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, annual inflation will edge down to 4.0-4.5
percent in 2022 and will remain close to 4 percent further on, the bank
said.

The [economy][1] is projected to grow in the range of 4.0 to 4.5 percent
in 2021. In 2022-2023, the Russian economy will grow 2.0-3.0 percent
annually.

"If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank
of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate increase at
its upcoming meetings," the bank said.

The bank added that today's decision will speed up the adjustment of
bank interest rates to the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) pursued.

The hawkish tone of the central bank, with inflation unlikely to return
to target next year, Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics, said
there will be an additional 75 basis point of interest rate hikes, to
7.25 percent by year-end.
