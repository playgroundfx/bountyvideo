Ireland's consumer confidence eased from a two-year high in July, as
households were increasingly concerned about the economic outlook,
results of a survey showed Friday.  
  
The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index fell to 84.7 from 87.2 in June.  
"The July reading hints at just a minor re-adjustment of Irish consumer
thinking of late," the KBC Bank said.  
  
All sub-indexes of the survey declined in July.  
  
The most notable weakening was in the sub-index for the economic
outlook. The measure dropped to 44.9 from 49.3.
