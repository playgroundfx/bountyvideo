Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector expanded at a softer pace in
March, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.3 in March from 53.9 in
February. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in the sector.

New orders growth softened for the third month in a row and sales growth
eased in March.

Business activity expanded at a softer pace in March and outstanding
work dropped at the quickest since June last year.

The number of employed remained stable in March, while rising output led
to expansion in purchasing. Suppliers' delivery times lengthened in
March.

"The pandemic and associated restrictions continued to trim new
[business][1] growth, according to respondents, contributing to a more
downbeat outlook for business activity over the next 12 months," David
Owen, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
