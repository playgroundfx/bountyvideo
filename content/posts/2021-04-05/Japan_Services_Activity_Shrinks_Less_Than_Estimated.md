Japan's services activity contracted at a slower than initially
estimated pace in March, final data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.3
in March from 46.3 in February. This was well above the flash score of
46.5 but below the neutral 50.0 mark, suggesting contraction in the
sector.  
  
The latest reading was the highest since January 2020, as some companies
lifted output at the end of the first quarter.

New [business][1] inflows fell at a softer pace in the latest survey
period. In anticipation of improving orders as the pandemic recedes,
Japanese service providers increased employment levels for the second
successive month.

Average cost burdens climbed for the fourth straight month in March.
However, average prices charged by service providers dropped further.

Business optimism for activity in the next 12 months strengthened to the
highest level since May 2013 in March.

The composite output index, which measures combined output in the
manufacturing and service sectors, rose to 49.9 in March from 48.2 in
February. The flash score was 48.3.
