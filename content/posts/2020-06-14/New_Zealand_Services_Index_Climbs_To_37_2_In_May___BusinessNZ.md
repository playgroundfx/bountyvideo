The services sector in New Zealand continued to contract in May, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Monday
with a Performance of Services Index score of 37.2.

That's up from 25.9 in April, although it remains well beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, sales (32.5), employment (40.9), new orders (35.1), stocks
(45.4) and supplier deliveries (41.0) all continued to contract in May.

"We'd caution that just being allowed to open doesn't guarantee more
activity. Standing back, there is no denying the outright level of the
PSI remains woeful and still sits well below the lows at around 45
recorded during the 2008-09 recession," BNZ Senior Economist Doug Steel
said.
