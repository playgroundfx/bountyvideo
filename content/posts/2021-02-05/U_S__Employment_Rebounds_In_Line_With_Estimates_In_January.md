Employment in the U.S. saw a modest increase in the month of January,
according to a closely watched report released by the Labor Department
on Friday.

The report said non-farm payroll employment edged up by 49,000 jobs in
January after plunging by a revised 227,000 jobs in December.

Economists had expected employment to rise by about 50,000 jobs
following the loss of 140,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate slid to 6.3 percent
in January from 6.7 percent in December. The unemployment rate was
expected to come in unchanged.
