Germany's factory orders declined more than expected in December largely
due to weak demand from euro area amid strict lockdown restrictions,
official data from Destatis revealed Friday.

Orders were down 1.9 percent on month, reversing a 2.7 percent rise in
November, Destatis reported. This was bigger than the economists'
forecast of -1 percent and marked the first drop since April 2020.

Domestic orders dropped moderately by 0.9 percent. Meanwhile, foreign
orders declined 2.6 percent due to a 7.5 percent fall in demand from the
euro area. Orders from other countries grew 0.5 percent.

Manufacturers of intermediate goods reported a monthly increase of 0.8
percent. Orders for consumer goods advanced 6.4 percent. On the other
hand, orders for capital goods dropped 4.6 percent on the previous
month.

New orders decreased due to the tightened lockdown but it exceeded the
level before the outbreak of the pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2019
by almost 5 percent, the [economy][1] ministry said.

Excluding major orders, real new orders in manufacturing were 2.0
percent lower than in the previous month.

On a yearly basis, industrial orders growth eased to 6.4 percent in
December from 6.7 percent in the previous month.

Today's data showed that the stricter lockdown measures since mid-
December, as well as the Christmas break, have finally hit German
industry, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist, said.

At face value, this only looks like a temporary breather, the economist
noted. However, with the Chinese New Year break as well as ongoing
lockdowns in many main trading partner countries, setbacks for industry
seem hard to avoid.

Real turnover in manufacturing advanced 1.9 percent month-on-month in
December after rising 1.1 percent in November.
