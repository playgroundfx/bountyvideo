India's central bank left its interest rates unchanged at the first
rate-setting meeting of the year despite inflation slowing to the target
band, but decided to lift its cash reserve ratio in two phases.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India unanimously
voted to maintain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate at 4.00 percent. The reverse repo
rate was retained at 3.35 percent.

The last change in the benchmark rate was a 40 basis point cut in May
2019, which took the cumulative reduction since February 2019 to 250
basis points.

The Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank rate were also left
unchanged at 4.25 percent.

The RBI raised the cash reserve ratio to 3.5 percent with effect from
March 27 and further to 4.00 percent from May 22. Thus, the bank
reversed its March 2020 cut of 100 basis points, which was triggered by
the economic impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The normalization of CRR opens up space for a variety of market
operations to inject additional liquidity, the bank said.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers also unanimously decided
to continue with the accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance as long as
necessary, at least to the current financial year and into the next year
to revive growth and ensure that inflation remains within the target.

Markets are too hawkish in discounting moderate hikes within the next
12-18 months, Capital Economics economist Shilan Shah said. The bank is
likely to keep the repo and reverse rates on hold at their current low
level for the foreseeable future, he added.

Inflation returned to the tolerance band, allowing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers to think
of measures to support economic expansion, assuage the impact of
Covid-19 and return the [economy][2] to a higher growth trajectory.

RBI projected 10.5 percent real GDP growth for 2021-22. Growth is seen
in the range of 26.2 to 8.3 percent in the first half and 6.0 percent in
third quarter of the fiscal year.

Consumer price inflation slowed to 4.6 percent from 6.9 percent in
December, which was within the target band of 2.0-6.0 percent.

The projection for CPI inflation was revised to 5.2 percent for the
fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020-21. Inflation is seen at 5.2-5.0
percent in the first half and 4.3 percent for third quarter of the
fiscal year.

In order to ensure that banks have additional funds to support recovery
amid the stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the RBI decided to
extend the deadline for meeting the tranche of the capital conservation
buffer.

Consequently, the implementation of the last tranche of the Capital
Conservation Buffer of 0.625 percent and also that of the Net Stable
Funding Ratio was deferred by another six months.
