Hungary's industrial production grew at a softer pace in December, data
from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Friday.

Industrial production grew a working-day adjusted 1.1 percent year-on-
year in December, after a 1.5 percent increase in November.

The industrial production volume increased 5.8 percent yearly in
December, after a 3.4 percent rise in the previous month. Economists had
forecast a 2.8 percent gain.

A growth in production was observed in manufacture of transport
equipment and food products, beverages and tobacco, while a decline was
seen in manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products, the
agency said.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production fell 2.4 percent
