UK house prices declined for the first time in six months in January,
data released by the Lloyds Bank subsidiary Halifax and IHS Markit
showed on Friday.

House prices fell 0.3 percent on month in January after remaining
unchanged in December. This was the first decline since May and the
biggest fall since April last year. Economists had forecast prices to
climb 0.3 percent.

In three months to January, house prices advanced 1.6 percent from the
preceding three months. On a yearly basis, house price growth slowed to
5.4 percent from 6 percent in three months to December.

There are some early signs that the upturn in the housing market could
be running out of steam, with the annual rate of house price inflation
cooling to its lowest level since August, Russell Galley, managing
director at Halifax, said.

"How far and how deep any slowdown proves to be is a challenge to
predict given the prevailing uncertainty created by the pandemic,"
Galley added.  
  
Structural demand changes, coupled with any further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interventions
by government, could yet sustain underlying market activity for some
time to come, Galley said.
