Indonesia's [economy][1] contracted more than expected in the fourth
quarter as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to dampen exports and
household consumption, data from the statistics bureau showed Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 2.19 percent year-on-year, bigger than the
economists' forecast of -2.0 percent but slower than the 3.5 percent
decline posted in the third quarter.

On a quarterly basis, GDP dropped 0.42 percent, confounding expectations
for an increase of 0.7 percent.

In the whole year of 2020, GDP was down 2.07 percent, the first annual
contraction since the 1998 Asian financial crisis.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household spending dropped
3.61 percent on year, while government spending grew 1.76 percent. Gross
fixed capital formation decreased 6.15 percent in fourth quarter.

Exports logged a marked decline of 7.21 percent and imports were down
13.52 percent.  
Although the economy contracted at a slightly slower pace in the fourth
quarter, a failure to control the virus means the recovery is likely to
be slow and fitful in the quarters ahead, Gareth Leather, an economist
at Capital Economics, said.

While the near-term outlook for the economy remains poor, long-term
economic prospects have received a boost in recent months by faster
progress on economic reforms.
