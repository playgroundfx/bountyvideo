France's private sector grew at the fastest pace since mid-2020 as
lockdown restrictions were eased and the [economy][1] began to reopen,
flash survey data published by IHS Markit revealed on Friday.

The composite output index climbed more-than-expected to 57.0 in May
from 51.6 in the previous month. The score was forecast to rise to 53.7.

The latest figure suggested that the private sector grew at the fastest
rate since July 2020, and was also the second-strongest since February
2018.

Manufacturing production continued to grow at a faster rate than
services activity. The factory Purchasing Managers' Index came in at
59.2 in May, up from 58.9 in the previous month and the expected level
of 58.5.

At the same time, the services PMI improved to a 10-month high of 56.6
from 50.3 a month ago and was above economists' forecast of 53.0.
