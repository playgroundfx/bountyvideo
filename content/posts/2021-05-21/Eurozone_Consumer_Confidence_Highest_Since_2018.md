Eurozone's consumer confidence rose more than expected in May to its
highest level in more than two-and-a-half years, preliminary data from
European Commission's monthly survey showed Friday.

The flash consumer confidence index climbed to -5.1 from -8.1 in April.
Economists had forecast a score of -6.8.

The latest reading was the highest since October 2018, when it was at
the same level. A reading higher than that, -4.7, was seen in August
that year.

The consumer confidence index for the EU also climbed three points to
-6.0 in May. That was the highest since February last year, when it was
-5.8.

The euro area indicator is slightly above its pre-pandemic level, while
the EU measure equaled the level, the commission said.

The latest survey was conducted from May 1 to 20.

The final figures is set to be released along with the results of the
monthly economic sentiment survey on May 28.
