Hong Kong's consumer prices increased in April, data from the Census and
Statistics Department showed on Friday.

The composite consumer price index rose 0.7 percent year-on-year in
April, following a 0.5 percent increase in March.

Excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, the
composite consumer price index increased 0.3 percent yearly in April,
after a 0.2 percent rise in the previous month.

"Looking ahead, overall price pressures should stay mild in the near
term as the local [economy][1] is still operating below its capacity," a
government spokesman said.
