Ireland's consumer confidence improved in May, survey data from KBC Bank
showed on Friday.

The consumer confidence increased to 85.8 in May from 77.9 in April.

The latest confidence index improved to its highest level since June
2019 as opening-up optimism continued to build, KBC Ireland analyst
Austin Hughes said.

"While the broad swathe of economic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) was positive, our sense is that
the key driver of the pick-up in confidence was the developing story of
increasing vaccinations and declining virus incidence in Ireland,"
Hughes said.

The current condition index rose to 95.5 in May from 89.0 in the
previous month.

The index of consumers expectations grew to 79.3 in May from 70.5 in the
prior month.
