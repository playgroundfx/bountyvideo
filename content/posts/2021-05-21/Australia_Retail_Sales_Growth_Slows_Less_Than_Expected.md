Australia's retail sales growth slowed less than expected pace in April,
preliminary estimates from the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed
on Friday.

Retail sales rose 1.1 percent month-on-month in April, slower than the
1.3 percent increase seen in March. Economists had forecast sales to
grow at a much weaker pace of 0.5 percent in April.

The monthly growth was driven by a 1.5 percent rise in food retailing
following falls in February and March. Cafes, restaurants and takeaway
food services climbed 2.5 percent.  
  
Through-the-year sales surged 25.1 percent in April from the last year,
following a 2.2 percent annual rise in March.
