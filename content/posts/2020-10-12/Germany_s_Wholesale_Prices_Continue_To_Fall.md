Germany's wholesale prices continued to decrease in September, data from
Destatis revealed on Monday.

Wholesale prices fell 1.8 percent year-on-year in September but slower
than the 2.2 percent decline posted in August. Prices have been falling
since February.

On a monthly basis, wholesale prices remained flat after falling 0.4
percent in August.

The annual fall was largely driven by a 17.1 percent decrease in
wholesale prices of petroleum products. Meanwhile, wholesale prices of
grains, animal feed, fruits, vegetables and tobacco products increased
from last year.
