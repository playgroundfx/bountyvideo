China will on Tuesday release September figures for imports, exports and
trade balance, headlining a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

Imports are expected to add 0.2 percent on year after losing 2.1 percent
in August. Exports are called higher by an annual 10.0 percent after
rising 9.5 percent in the previous month. The trade surplus is pegged at
$59.98 billion, up from $58.93 billion a month earlier.

New Zealand will see September numbers for electronic retail card
spending and food inflation. In August, card spending sank 7.9 percent
on month and 0.8 percent on year, while food prices were up an annual
4.2 percent.

The central bank in Indonesia will conclude its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
and then announce its decision on interest rates. The bank is widely
expected to keep its benchmark lending rate steady at 4.00 percent.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Thailand are closed on Tuesday in
observance of King Bhumibol Memorial Day.
