Ireland's construction sector deteriorated at a slower pace in
September, data from the IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 47.0 in
September from 44.0 in August. Any reading below 50 indicates
contraction in the sector.

"The results of the latest Ulster Bank Construction PMI survey indicate
that Irish construction firms continue to report that they face
challenging circumstances at present," Chief Economist Republic of
Ireland at Ulster Bank Simon Barry said.  
  
Commercial activity neared stabilization in September, while housing and
civil engineering activity declined at a marked rates, albeit at a
slower pace.

New orders declined at a softer pace in September.

The 12-month outlook for [business][1] activity declined to the lowest
in four months in September and Brexit was also a factor dampening
sentiment.

The supply chain disruption was evident in September and delivery time
lengthened.

Input cost increased in September and the rate of inflation increased to
the fastest since April last year. Purchasing activity fell for the
second straight month.
