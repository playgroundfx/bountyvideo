The private sector in Hong Kong continued to expand marginally in March,
and at a slightly faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics
showed on Thursday with a seasonally adjusted PMI score of 50.5.

That's up from 50.2 in February and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, March saw the sharpest increase in staffing levels since
June 2011 as [business][1] activity stabilized.

Ongoing concerns around the impact of the pandemic led to a pessimistic
outlook for the coming year, reversing the optimism seen in February.
That said, sentiment was still one of the highest over the past two
years.

Competitive pressures and the offering of discounts meant that output
prices continued to fall. That said, the rate of decline was only slight
and the weakest in 21 months amid upwards pressure on charges from input
cost inflation.
