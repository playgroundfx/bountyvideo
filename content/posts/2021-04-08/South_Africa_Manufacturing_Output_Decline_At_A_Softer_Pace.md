South Africa's manufacturing output declined after a softer pace in
February, data from Statistics South Africa showed on Thursday.

Manufacturing output declined 2.1 percent year-on-year in February,
following a 4.2 percent fall in January.

The largest negative contributions came from petroleum, chemical
products, rubber and plastic products, basic iron and steel, non-ferrous
metal products, metal products and machinery, and furniture and 'other'
manufacturing.

On a month-on-month basis, manufacturing output decreased 1.2 percent in
February, after remaining unchanged in the preceding month. Economists
had expected a 0.4 percent rise.

During the three months ended in February, manufacturing output gained
0.3 percent, after a 2.0 percent increase in the preceding period.
