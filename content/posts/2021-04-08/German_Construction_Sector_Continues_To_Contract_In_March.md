Germany's construction sector continued to shrink in March but the pace
of decline slowed from February, survey data from IHS Markit showed on
Thursday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 47.5 in March from
41.0 in February.

Nonetheless, a score below 50 indicates contraction in the sector and
the latest reading was the second-highest since the start of the
[coronavirus][1] disease 2019 pandemic behind that seen last August.

Survey respondents reported bad weather in March, alongside delays
caused by long wait times on planning permissions and a soft patch in
demand.

Commercial activity recorded its shallowest decline for 13 months,
though was still the worst-performing sub-sector narrowly behind civil
engineering. Housing activity recorded the slowest contraction.

Phil Smith, an associate director at IHS Markit, said reports from
surveyed businesses indicated that the sector continued to be held back
by a soft patch in new orders linked to the impact of the pandemic on
clients' willingness and ability to invest, with several firms also
commenting on delays in planning permissions.
