Policymakers saw the recent rise in bond yields was largely premature
for the euro area and that warranted the maintenance of an ample degree
of stimulus, the minutes of the European Central Bank's March 10-11
meeting showed Thursday.

"The recent tightening of financing conditions was generally seen as
premature for the euro area, which was still in a weaker cyclical
position than the United States," the minutes, which the ECB calls the
"account" said.

The ECB staff projections in March were largely unchanged from December.

"This was widely seen to call for a continuing high degree of
accommodation," the minutes said.

In the March [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session, the ECB decided to leave interest rates
unchanged and to conduct asset purchases under the EUR 1,850 billion
pandemic emergency purchase program, or PEPP, at a significantly higher
pace over the next quarter.

An argument was also put forward that higher real rates were not
necessarily a cause for concern and should not trigger a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
intervention if they reflected higher growth prospects rather than
higher real term premia, the minutes said.

Members agreed that the PEPP purchase volume needed to be increased
significantly to give a clear message to [markets][1] on the Governing
Council's "reaction function".

Policymakers also stressed the need to avoid giving the impression of
being overly focused on sovereign yields or reacting mechanically to a
set of indicators of financing conditions.  
  
"Moreover, the view was put forward that the tightening might not be
sizeable and persistent enough to affect broader financing conditions
materially," the minutes said.

Rate-setters also highlighted that the flexibility embodied in the PEPP
was symmetric, implying that the purchase pace could be increased and
decreased according to market conditions.
