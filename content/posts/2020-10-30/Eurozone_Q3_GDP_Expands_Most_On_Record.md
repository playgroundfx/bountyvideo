The euro area [economy][1] expanded at the fastest pace on record in the
third quarter after shrinking sharply in the preceding period due to the
restrictions imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus, preliminary
flash estimate from Eurostat showed Friday.

Gross domestic product expanded 12.7 percent on quarter, this was the
sharpest growth seen since the series started in 1995. Economists had
forecast a quarterly growth of 9.4 percent after falling 11.8 percent in
the second quarter.

On a yearly basis, GDP fell 4.3 percent after easing 14.8 percent in the
second quarter. GDP was forecast to decline 15 percent.

The EU27 grew 12.1 percent sequentially but fell 3.9 percent from the
same period last year.

Among member countries, France recorded the highest increase of 18.2
percent compared to the previous quarter, followed by Spain and Italy.
Germany grew 8.2 percent.

Eurostat is set to release next estimate on November 13.

Consumer price data released today showed that inflation remained
negative for a third month in October. The harmonized consumer price
index decreased 0.3 percent, same as in September.

"The strong third quarter GDP figure will not make much of an impression
as a new downturn is almost certainly upon us," Bert Colijn, an ING
economist.

With inflation remaining very weak and GDP set to fall again in the
fourth quarter, the ECB has started to work on a new monetary stimulus
package, the economist added.  
  
Another communiqu√© from Eurostat revealed that the jobless rate was
unchanged at 8.3 percent in September.
