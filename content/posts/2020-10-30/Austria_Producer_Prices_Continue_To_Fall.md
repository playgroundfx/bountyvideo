Austria's producer prices declined in September, albeit at a softer
pace, figures from Statistics Austria showed on Friday.

The producer price index declined 1.8 percent year-on-year in September,
following a 1.9 percent fall in August.

The decline in producer prices was mainly driven by a fall in energy
prices and intermediate goods by 5.5 percent and 2.2 percent,
respectively.

Meanwhile, prices for capital goods rose 0.6 percent in September and
those for consumer goods increased 0.5 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.1 percent in September, after
remaining unchanged in the preceding month.

In the third quarter, producer prices fell 2.0 percent yearly, following
a 2.3 percent decline in the previous quarter.

On a quarterly basis, producer prices rose 0.1 percent in the third
quarter, after a 1.7 percent fall in the preceding quarter.
