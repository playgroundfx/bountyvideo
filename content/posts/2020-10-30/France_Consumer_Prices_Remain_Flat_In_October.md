French consumer prices remained flat in October, flash data from the
statistical office Insee showed on Friday.

On a yearly basis, consumer prices remained unchanged for the second
straight month in October. Final data is due on November 13.

The harmonized index of consumer prices also remained stable for the
second month in a row. Economists had forecast a 0.1 percent annual
increase.

Data showed that food price inflation advanced to 1.5 percent from 0.9
percent, while the increase in services cost slowed to 0.3 percent from
0.6 percent.

Meanwhile, energy and manufactured product prices declined 7.7 percent
and 0.1 percent, respectively.

Month-on-month, consumer prices edged down 0.1 percent, but slower than
the 0.5 percent drop seen in the previous month. The HICP was down 0.1
percent versus a 0.6 percent decrease in September.
