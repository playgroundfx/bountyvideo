The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in May, and at a
faster rate, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 38.4.

That's down from 41.9 in April, and it moves further beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production fell at a sharper rate as COVID-19 disruption
continued.

New orders plummeted to an extent not seen since the global financial
crisis, while supplier delivery times lengthened sharply one again.
