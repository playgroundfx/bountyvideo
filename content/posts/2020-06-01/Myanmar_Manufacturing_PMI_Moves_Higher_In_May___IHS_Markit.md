The manufacturing sector in Myanmar continued to contract in May,
although at a slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 38.9.

That's up from the record low 29.0 in April, although it remains beneath
the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new orders and output declined at their second-fastest
rates since the survey began.

There were record falls in employment and stocks of finished goods,
although [business][1] expectations recovered some ground since the
April survey.
