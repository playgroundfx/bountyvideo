Sweden's manufacturing sector shrank at a softer pace in May, as
restrictions to contain the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic
eased, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF
showed on Monday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector increased to
39.2 in May from 36.4 in April. Nonetheless, any reading below 50
indicates contraction in the sector.

The economic downturn in the manufacturing industry has slowed down, but
it is too early to judge whether the economic downturn has passed even
though the likelihood of a recovery has increased, Swedbank analyst
Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-index, the production and order intake indices reported
the largest increases in May. Employment declined in the month, and
delivery time decreased.

Production plans for the next six months have became less pessimistic in
May, which is a noticeable improvement and a positive economic signal
compared to the bottom level in April, Kennemar said.

Price pressure from the supply chain decreased in May and indicated a
continuous weaker price pressure annually from the supplier level.
