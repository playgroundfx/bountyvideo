China's manufacturing sector returned to expansion zone in May driven by
the easing of restrictions related to the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19,
pandemic, survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday.

The headline manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.7 in
May from 49.4 in April.

The latest score above 50.0 indicates a renewed improvement in overall
operating conditions but the pace of expansion was only marginal.

It appears that growth has returned to the manufacturing sector, but new
export orders and imports were still in contraction, ING economist Iris
Pang, said. A recovery in manufacturing and employment in some sectors
remains challenging.

According to official PMI survey, released over the weekend, the factory
PMI dropped to 50.6 in May from 50.8 in April. Meanwhile, the non-
manufacturing PMI advanced to 53.6 from 53.2.

Manufacturers reported an increase in output following a record fall in
February, due to the resumption of work. The pace of growth was the
fastest since January 2011.

However, total new work declined again as there was a historic fall in
external demand in May.

A lack of new orders drove the first fall in backlogs of work since
February 2016. At the same time, the resumption of production led to a
renewed increase in buying activity.

The employment sub-index rebounded in May but it remained in negative
territory.

Supply chains stabilized following severe disruptions in prior months
due to restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Manufacturers signaled a third successive monthly fall in average input
costs, while factory gate prices were little-changed from the previous
month.

Business confidence picked up in May, with firms generally optimistic
that output will rise over the next year.
