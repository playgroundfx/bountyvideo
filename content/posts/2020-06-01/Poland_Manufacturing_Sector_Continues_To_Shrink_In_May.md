Poland's manufacturing sector contracted at the second sharpest pace
since January 2009, due to ongoing lockdown restrictions designed to
contain the spread of [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic, survey
data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 40.6 in
May from a record low of 31.9 in April.

Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. This was the
second sharpest deterioration in [business][2] conditions since January
2009.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in May and new orders fell at the
second-fastest rate in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), as demand was impacted by
lockdown measures both domestically and worldwide.

New export orders declined at the second-fastest rate in the survey
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and output fell due to the ongoing factory closure and downturn
in demand.

Employment fell at the third-fastest rate in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and
input inventories declined at the second-strongest pace in nearly seven
years.

Backlogs of work continued to fall rapidly due to weak demand. Purchase
of new inputs decreased at the third-strongest rate on record.

On the price front, input prices increased sharply in May and prices
charged for manufactured goods continued to fall.

Finally, the 12-month outlook for production stabilized in May following
a record degree of pessimism in April.
