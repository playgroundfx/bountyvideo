The manufacturing sector in the Philippines continued to contract in
May, albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 40.1.

That's up from the record low 31.6 in April, although it remains beneath
the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, the rates of decline in output and new orders eased but
remained sharp.

Employment levels fell steeply again, while output prices ricked higher
as cost pressures rose.
