The manufacturing sector in Thailand continued to contract in May,
albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 41.6.

That's up from 36.8 in April, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, Production volumes remained sharply lower - while new
orders fell again, led by a record decline in exports.

Business sentiment remained deeply negative as firms worried about
excess capacity sought to contain costs by cutting staff numbers in May.
