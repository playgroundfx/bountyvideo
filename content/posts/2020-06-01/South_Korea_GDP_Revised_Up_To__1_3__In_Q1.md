South Korea's gross domestic product was down a seasonally adjusted 1.3
percent on quarter in the first three months of 2020, the Bank of Korea
said in Tuesday's preliminary reading.

That's an upward revision from last month's advance estimate that
suggested a decline of 1.4 percent on quarter following the 1.3 percent
quarterly increase in the three months prior.

On a yearly basis, GDP was revised up to 1.4 percent from last month's
figure of 1.3 percent following the 2.3 percent increase in the previous
three months.
