The manufacturing sector in South Korea continued to contract in May,
and at a faster rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 41.3.

That's down from 41.6 in April, and it moves further beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output continued to slide at an historic rate as the
global [economy][1] struggles in the grips of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Demand for South Korean goods continued to plummet on further supply
chain disruptions.
