The manufacturing sector in Malaysia continued to contract in May,
albeit at a much slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 45.6.

That's up sharply from the record low 31.3 in April, although it remains
beneath the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from
contraction.

Individually, new orders and output fell at considerably weaker rates in
May, although the COVID-19 pandemic led to further supply chain
disruption.

The deterioration in demand was solid, although significantly weaker
than seen in April. Of the minority of companies that recorded sales
growth, clients reopening their businesses had led to new work intakes.
