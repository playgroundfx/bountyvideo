India's manufacturing conditions recorded another sharp deterioration in
May due to fall in demand, output and employment amid the ongoing
[coronavirus][1] lockdown, survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Monday.

The headline IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or
PMI, increased to 30.8 in May from 27.4 in April. Any reading below 50
indicates contraction in the sector.

New orders continued to fall in May and were the second-fastest since
the inception of series in March 2005. Demand from international market
deteriorated further.

Firms continued to cut their production in May. The number of workers
declined further due to lower production requirements. The rate of
contraction in workforce accelerated to the fastest in the survey
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Purchasing activity reduced in May as need for inputs decreased.

On the price front, input prices declined further in May and suppliers
reduced their prices to secure orders.

Manufacturers were optimistic toward the [business][2] outlook for next
12 months in May, hopping to return to growth after coronavirus-related
restrictions are lifted.

"This result is particularly poignant given the record contraction in
April which was driven by widespread business closures," Eliot Kerr, an
economist at IHS Markit, said.

"The further reduction in May highlights the challenges that businesses
might face in the recovery from this crisis, with demand remaining
subdued while the longevity of the pandemic remains uncertain," Kerr
added.
