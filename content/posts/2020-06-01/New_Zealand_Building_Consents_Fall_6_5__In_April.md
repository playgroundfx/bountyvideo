Zealand said on Tuesday - coming in at 2,168 consents.

That follows the downwardly revised 22.0 percent fall in April
(originally -21.3 percent).

In the year ended April 2020, the actual number of new dwellings
consented was 37,180, up 8.1 percent from the April 2019 year.

The annual value of non-residential building work consented was NZ$6.6
billion, down 13 percent from the April 2019 year.
