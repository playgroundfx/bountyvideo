The Czech Republic's manufacturing sector contracted at the second
sharpest pace since the depths of the global financial crisis over
eleven years ago, amid [coronavirus][1] outbreak, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Monday.

The headline manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to
39.6 in May from 35.1 in April. Any reading below 50 indicates
contraction in the sector.

Output and new orders contracted in May. The rate of decline in
production eased, but this was one of the fastest since the survey began
in June 2001.

New export order volume declined due to weak foreign client demand in
May and backlogs of work deteriorated. The rate of job shedding was the
second-sharpest since July 2009 due to continuing uncertainty.

Purchasing activity declined at the second-quickest rate since March
2009 amid weaker client demand.

On the price front, manufacturers reduced their factory gate charges and
the rate of input cost inflation eased.

The Czech National Bank (CNB) forecasts slower inflation in the coming
months, with the recent interest rate cuts mirroring the challenging
economic conditions, Si√¢n Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
