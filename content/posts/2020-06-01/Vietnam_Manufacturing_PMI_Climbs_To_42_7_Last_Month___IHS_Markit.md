The manufacturing sector in Vietnam continued to contract in May, albeit
at a slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on Monday
with a manufacturing PMI score of 42.7.

That's up from 32.7 in April, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, employment continued to fall, while output prices were
slashed in an attempt to secure new [business][1].

Disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sixth successive monthly
decline in manufacturing production.
