Turkey's manufacturing sector contracted in May amid [coronavirus][1]
pandemic, but the pace of decline slowed from April, survey data from
IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Istanbul Chamber of Industry Turkey manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 40.9 in May from 33.4 in April. Any
reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.  
  
Output and new orders continued to report sharp slowdown as Covid-19
pandemic disrupted [business][2] and hamper demand. Employment decreased
for the second straight month, albeit at a softer pace.

Stock of finished goods was lowered in May, and lack of new orders led
firms to moderate their purchasing activity. Suppliers' delivery time
lengthened sharply in May.

Weakness of the Turkish currency against the US dollar led to a sharp
and accelerated increase in input costs. The rate of inflation was the
fastest in a year and manufactures raised their selling prices.

"The Turkish manufacturing sector continued to be buffeted by the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in May, according to the latest PMI
data, preventing a swift rebound following a sharp slowdown in April,"
Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit, said.

"As long as the virus continues to be brought under control, therefore,
the move back to growth should follow in the months ahead," Harker added
