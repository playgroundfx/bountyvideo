French manufacturing confidence improved in April, monthly survey data
from the statistical office Insee showed on Thursday.

The manufacturing sentiment index advanced to 104 in April from 99.0 in
March. Economists had forecast the index to remain at 99.0.

The reading exceeded its long-term average of 100 for the first time
since February 2020.

Managers were more positive about their order books and their past and
future production. The order book balance improved to -15, the highest
since February 2020, from -23 in March.

The export order book balance rose to -22 from -30 in March.

Manufacturers judged more favorably the development in their recent
production. The general production expectations index came in at 2, down
from 5 a month ago.

Personal prospects of production have been brightening. The
corresponding index advanced to 12 from 7.

Regarding employment, manufacturers worsened their opinion on the past
change in the workforce size. The indicator for past workforce size fell
to -10 from -6 and that for expected workforce size decreased to -6 from
-4.

The overall [business][1] confidence index dropped to 95 in April from
97 in March. The moderate fall was the result of the deterioration in
the outlook for the tertiary sector, which was partly offset by a
further improvement in the business climate in industry.
