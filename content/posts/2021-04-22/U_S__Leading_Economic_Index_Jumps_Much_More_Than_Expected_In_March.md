A report released by the Conference Board on Thursday showed its index
of leading U.S. economic indicators increased by much more than expected
in the month of March.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index jumped by 1.3
percent in March after edging down by a revised 0.1 percent in February.

Economists had expected the index to climb by 0.6 percent compared to
the 0.2 percent dip originally reported for the previous month.

"The improvement in the U.S. LEI, with all ten components contributing
positively, suggests economic momentum is increasing in the near term,"
said Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at the
Conference Board.

He added, "The widespread gains among the leading indicators are
supported by an accelerating vaccination campaign, gradual lifting of
mobility restrictions, as well as current and expected fiscal stimulus."

Ozyildirim said the recent trend by the leading index is consistent with
the [economy][1] picking up in the coming months and noted the
Conference Board projects year-over-year growth could reach 6.0 percent
in 2021.

The report showed the coincident economic index rose by 0.6 percent in
March after slipping by 0.1 percent in February.

Meanwhile, the lagging economic index fell by 0.5 percent in March after
surging up by 1.6 percent in the previous month.
