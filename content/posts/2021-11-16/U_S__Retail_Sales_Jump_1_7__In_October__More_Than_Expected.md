Retail sales in the U.S. shot up by more than expected in the month of
October, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Tuesday.

The Commerce Department said retail sales spiked by 1.7 percent in
October after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.8 percent in September.

Economists had expected retail sales to jump by 1.4 percent compared to
the 0.7 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

"An improving Covid situation, easing supply constraints in the auto
sector and an early start to holiday shopping all boosted purchases last
month," said Gregory Daco, Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Households were still willing to open their wallets in the
face of higher prices - which inflated nominal sales figures - but there
is increasing evidence that higher inflation is eroding purchasing
power."

The report showed sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers soared by 1.8
percent in October after shooting up by 1.2 percent in September.

Excluding the jump in sales by motor vehicles and parts dealers, retail
sales still surged up by 1.7 percent in October after rising by 0.7
percent in September. Ex-auto sales were expected to advance by 1.0
percent.

Sales by non-store retailers, gas stations and electronics and appliance
stores all saw substantial growth during the month.

The report also showed significant increases in sales by building
materials and supplies dealers, miscellaneous store retailers and
department stores.

Closely watched core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline,
building materials and food services, also jumped by 1.6 percent in
October after climbing by 0.5 percent in September.

"As the [economy][1] heads into 2022, an improving health situation
should reinvigorate consumer confidence while a strengthening jobs
recovery and strong wage gains should support income growth," Daco said.

He added, "Healthy household finances along with some $2.5tn in excess
savings should support consumer spending growth above 4% in 2022,
following an expected 8% advance in 2021."
