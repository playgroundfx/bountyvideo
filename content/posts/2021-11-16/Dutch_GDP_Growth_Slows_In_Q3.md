The Dutch [economy][1] grew at a slower pace in the third quarter
largely due to weak investment, data from the statistical office CBS
showed Tuesday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.9 percent sequentially, following the 3.8
percent expansion posted in the second quarter. However, this was faster
than the economists' forecast of 1.7 percent.

Likewise, the annual growth eased to 5.0 percent from 10.4 percent a
quarter ago.

On the expenditure-side, household spending grew 3.8 percent and
government consumption advanced 0.7 percent. Meanwhile, investment
dropped 2.7 percent.

Exports and imports of goods and services moved up 1.3 percent and 1.6
percent, respectively.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said consumers lifted
their spending in September. The annual growth in consumer spending
improved to 4.6 percent from 3.1 percent in August.  
  
In September, exports grew at a slower pace of 5.3 percent year-on-year
in September, following a 9 percent rise in August, another report from
the CBS revealed. At the same time, imports were 8.1 percent higher than
in September 2020.
