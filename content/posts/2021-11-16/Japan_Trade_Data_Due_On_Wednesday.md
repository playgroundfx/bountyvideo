Japan will on Wednesday release September numbers for core machine
orders and October trade data, setting the pace for a modest day in
Asia-Pacific economic activity.

Machine orders are tipped to rise 1.8 percent on month and 17.4 percent
on year after sinking 2.4 percent on month and jumping 17.0 percent on
year in August.

Imports are expected to climb 31.9 percent on year, down from 38.6
percent in September. Exports are called higher by an annual 9.9
percent, slowing from 13.0 percent in the previous month. The trade
deficit is pegged at 310 billion yen after showing a 622.8 billion yen
shortfall a month earlier.

Australia will see October results for the Westpac leading economic
index, as well as Q3 data for wage prices. The leading index eased 0.02
percent on month in September. Wage prices are expected to add 0.5
percent on quarter and 2.2 percent on year after gaining 0.4 percent on
quarter and 1.7 percent on year in Q2.

Singapore will release October figures for non-oil domestic exports,
with forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.4 percent on month and 15.0
percent on year following the 1.2 percent monthly increase and the 12.3
percent annual gain.

The Philippines will provide September numbers for retail sales; in
August, sales were up 2.0 percent on year.
