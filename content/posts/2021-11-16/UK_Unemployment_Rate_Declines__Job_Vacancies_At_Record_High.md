The UK unemployment rate declined and job vacancies rose to a record
level, underscoring the recovery in the labor market as the end of
furlough scheme had little impact, the Office for National Statistics
said on Tuesday.  
  
The unemployment rate decreased 0.5 percentage points on the quarter to
4.3 percent in the third quarter, the labor force survey revealed. The
expected rate was 4.4 percent.

At the same time, the employment rate increased 0.4 percentage points to
75.4 percent.

During August to October, the number of job vacancies continued to rise
to a new record of 1,172,000, with 15 of the 18 industry sectors showing
record highs, data showed.

In October, there were 29.3 million employees, up 160,000 on the revised
September 2021.

"Record job vacancies suggest that the chronic staff shortages
encountered by businesses are intensifying and this could derail the
recovery by forcing firms into a more long-lasting decline in their
operating capacity," British Chamber of Commerce Head of Economics,
Suren?Thiru, said.

At the Treasury Committee hearing on Tuesday, Bank of England Governor
Andrew Bailey said the official data on labor market due this month and
in December would be critical for the next interest rate decision.

Today's release has given the Bank of England an amber light and the
next labor market release on December 14 will probably give it the green
light to raise interest rates from 0.10 percent to 0.25 percent on
December 16, Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

In July to September, annual growth in average total pay including
bonuses logged an annual growth of 5.8 percent, bigger than the
economists' forecast of 5.6 percent.  
Excluding bonuses, average total pay advanced 4.9 percent annually
versus the expected rate of 5 percent.

The jobless claims decreased by 14,900 in October from the previous
month. The claimant count rate dropped marginally to 5.1 percent from
5.2 percent in September.
