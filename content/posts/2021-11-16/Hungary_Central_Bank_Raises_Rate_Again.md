Hungary's central bank raised its key interest rate again and signaled
that it will be hiked in coming months, citing persistent inflationary
pressures.  
  
The Monetary Council decided to hike the central bank base rate by 30
basis points to 2.10 percent, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank said in a
statement on Tuesday  
The previous change in the rate was a 15 basis point hike in October.  
  
"A persistent rise in external inflationary pressures and increasing
second-round inflation risks have necessitated more extensive and longer
lasting monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening," the bank said. "The Council still
considers it necessary to continue the interest rate tightening cycle on
a monthly basis."

Policymakers expect inflation to rise above 7 percent in November. They
assessed that higher commodity prices are rapidly being incorporated
into consumer prices in a buoyant domestic demand environment, leading
to rising inflation in general.

"In addition to the lasting effects of supply, the pick-up in wage
growth next year due to the increase in the minimum wage and strong
economic growth, the consumer price index is expected to decline only
slowly from the end of this year," the bank said.

Hence, inflation is expected to be substantially higher in 2022 as a
whole than projected in the September Inflation Report, the bank said.

Policymakers assessed that inflation is clearly on an upward path along
the risk scenarios compared to the September projection and the December
forecasts is set to give a clearer picture.

Inflation is set to remain high due to persistently high commodity and
energy prices, rises in international freight costs and increasingly
wider supply disruptions continue to point to a higher and more
persistent external inflation environment.  
  
The tight labor market, coupled with strong wage growth and a higher
inflation environment, may lead to increases in inflation expectations
and to strengthen second-round inflation risks, the bank said.

Official data released earlier Tuesday showed, GDP grew by 6.1 percent
year-on-year in the third quarter, which meant output was 0.7 percent
above its pre-crisis level.  
  
The country's [economy][1] is expected to grow between 6.5 and 7 percent
this year and by between 5 and 6 percent in 2022.
