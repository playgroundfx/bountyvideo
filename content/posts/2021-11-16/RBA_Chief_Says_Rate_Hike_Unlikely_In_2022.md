Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said the latest data and
forecasts do not warrant an increase in the cash rate in 2022.  
  
In order to consider a rate hike next year, the [economy][1] and
inflation would have to turn out very differently from the central
scenario, he said in an address to the Australian Business Economists,
on Tuesday.

"It is likely to take time to meet the condition we have set for an
increase in the cash rate and the Board is prepared to be patient," Lowe
added.

It is possible that faster-than-expected progress continues to be made
towards achieving the inflation target. If so, there would be a case to
lift the cash rate before 2024, the governor noted.

Lowe said it is also possible that progress will be slower than
expected, which would result in the cash rate staying at current levels
for longer.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the cash rate, the Board has said that it will not increase
the cash rate until inflation is sustainably in the target range. It is
likely that wages will need to be growing at 3 point something percent
to sustain inflation around the middle of the target band.

"This doesn't mean that we have a target for wages growth or that wages
growth is the only determinant of inflation," said Lowe.

At the November monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said they will not
raise the cash rate until certain criteria are met, and is prepared to
be patient.
