A report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed U.S. import
prices jumped by more than expected in the month of October.

The Labor Department said import prices shot up by 1.2 percent in
October after rising by 0.4 percent in September. Economists had
expected import prices to increase by 1.0 percent.

The stronger than expected import price growth came as prices for fuel
imports skyrocketed by 8.6 percent in October after spiking by 3.9
percent in September.

Excluding prices for fuel imports, import prices rose by 0.4 percent in
October after inching up by 0.1 percent in September.

Higher prices for non-fuel industrial supplies and materials, automotive
vehicles, foods, feeds, and beverages, and consumer goods contributed to
the increase in non-fuel import prices.

The Labor Department said export prices also surged up by 1.5 percent in
October after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.4 percent in September.

Export prices were expected to advance by 0.9 percent compared to the
0.1 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month.

Prices for agricultural exports jumped by 1.0 percent in October after
tumbling by 1.5 percent in September, with the rebound reflecting higher
prices for wheat, other animal feeds, cotton, meat, and dairy products.

The report showed prices for non-agricultural exports also shot up by
1.5 percent in October after rising by 0.6 percent in September.

Compared to the same month a year ago, import prices in October were up
by 10.7 percent, while export prices were up by 18.0 percent.

"In the near term, import price inflation is poised to remain
uncomfortably high given unyielding supply disruptions, elevated energy
prices, and warming domestic demand in Q4," said Mahir Rasheed, U.S.
Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "However, we expect price dynamics to ease in early 2022 as
demand pressures cool and supply factors gradually improve."
