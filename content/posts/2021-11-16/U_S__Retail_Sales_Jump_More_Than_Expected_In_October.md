Retail sales in the U.S. shot up by more than expected in the month of
October, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Tuesday.

The report said retail sales spiked by 1.7 percent in October after
climbing by an upwardly revised 0.8 percent in September.

Economists had expected retail sales to jump by 1.4 percent compared to
the 0.7 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding sales by motor vehicles and parts dealers, retail sales still
surged up by 1.7 percent in October after rising by 0.7 percent in
September. Ex-auto sales were expected to advance by 1.0 percent.
