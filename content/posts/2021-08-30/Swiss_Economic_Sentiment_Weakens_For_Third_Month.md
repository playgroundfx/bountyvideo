Switzerland's economic sentiment weakened for a third month in a row and
at a sharp rate in August, suggesting that the recovery from the
pandemic is set to continued albeit at a slower pace, results of a
survey showed Monday.  
  
The Economic Barometer fell to 113.5 from 130.9 in July, revised from
129.8, the monthly survey by the KOF economic institute showed.
Economists had forecast a score of 125.0.  
  
The reading remained significantly above its long-term average.

"Accordingly, in the coming months the economic recovery from the
consequences of the pandemic is expected to continue," KOF said.  
  
All indicator groups except those from the construction industry
contributed to this decline, the institute added.

"The fourth wave of the pandemic, which is now becoming increasingly
clear, is apparently fueling doubts about largely unhindered economic
activity in the near future," KOF said.
