UK mortgage approvals and lending declined in October as buyers brought
forward their borrowing to September to take advantage of stamp duty
holiday, official data revealed Monday.

Approvals for house purchases fell to 67,200 in October from 71,900 in
September, the Bank of England said. This was the lowest since June 2020
and also below the expected level of 71,250.

Net borrowing of mortgage debt by individuals totaled GBP 1.6 billion in
October, down from GBP 9.3 billion in September. This was the lowest
since July 2021.

The bank said October's decrease was driven by borrowing brought forward
to September to take advantage of stamp duty land tax relief, before it
was completely tapered off.

Individuals borrowed GBP 0.7 billion in consumer credit in October
versus economists' forecast of GBP 0.4 billion. The majority of this was
GBP 0.6 billion of additional borrowing on credit cards, which was the
strongest net borrowing since July 2020.

Further, data showed that borrowing of non-financial businesses was GBP
0.4 billion in October compared to a net repayment of GBP 0.4 billion in
September.

Net borrowing by large non-financial businesses was GBP 2.0 billion in
October versus GBP 1.1 billion in September. Small and medium sized non-
financial businesses repaid GBP 1.6 billion, on net, rising from a GBP
1.5 billion net repayment in September.
