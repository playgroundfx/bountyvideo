Updated projections show members of the Federal Reserve expect stronger
economic growth and higher inflation this year, although the central
bank still expects to keep interest rates at near-zero levels through
2023.

The updated forecasts were released on Wednesday along with the
announcement of the Fed's universally expected decision to maintain the
target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent.

The central bank also reiterated it plans to continue purchasing bonds
at a rate of at least $120 billion per month until "substantial further
progress" has been made toward its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) goals.

The Fed said members now expect U.S. GDP to soar by 6.5 percent in 2021
compared to the 4.2 percent spike forecast last December.

The forecast for the pace of growth in core consumer prices, which
exclude food and energy prices, was also upwardly revised to 2.2 percent
from 1.8 percent.

In its accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that
indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently.

Nonetheless, the median forecast from Fed members predicts interest
rates will remain at current levels through 2023.

The Fed once again reiterated that rates will remain unchanged until
labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with its
assessments of maximum employment and inflation is on track to
moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

The latest forecasts show GDP growth is expected to slow to 3.3 percent
in 2022 and 2.2 percent in 2023, while core consumer prices are expected
to rise by 2.0 percent in 2022 and 2.1 percent in 2023.

"The updated economic projections released after the Fed's mid-March
meeting show that officials expect strong economic growth this year to
have only a transitory impact on inflation, which explains why most
still aren't thinking about thinking raising interest rates," said
Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "With the Fed keen to let inflation run above its target for a
while, we expect they will keep rates on hold even if higher inflation
proves a little more stubborn than they currently anticipate."

The statement from the Fed once again noted the path of the [economy][1]
will depend significantly on the course of the coronavirus, including
progress on vaccinations.
