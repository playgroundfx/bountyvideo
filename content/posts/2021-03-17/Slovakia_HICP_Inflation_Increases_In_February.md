Slovakia's EU measure of inflation increased in February, data from the
Statistical Office Of the Slovak Republic showed on Wednesday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 0.9 percent year-
on-year in February, following a 0.7 percent gain in January. This was
in line with economists' expectation.

On a month-on-month basis, increased 0.3 percent in February, same as
seen in the preceding month.

Earlier, the statistical office reported that the consumer price index
rose 0.9 percent yearly in February and gained 0.3 percent from a month
ago.

The core inflation rose to 1.3 percent in February from 1.2 percent in
the prior month.
