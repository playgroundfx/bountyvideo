Australia's leading index continued to suggest that the economic growth
will remain positive through much of 2021, latest survey results from
Westpac and the Melbourne Institute showed on Wednesday.

The six-month annualized growth rate in the Westpac Melbourne Institute
Leading Index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity
relative to trend three to nine months into the future, fell to 2.64
percent in February from 3.83 percent in January.

The [economy][1] is expected to grow 4.5 percent this year driven by
strong consumer spending.

Over the last six months, the growth rate in the leading index was
lifted to 2.64 percent from -0.2 percent.

Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac said, the Reserve Bank of
Australia is set to remain on hold for the next few months before the
Board decides whether to extend its Yield Curve Control [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to a
longer bond than the current April 2024 bond.
