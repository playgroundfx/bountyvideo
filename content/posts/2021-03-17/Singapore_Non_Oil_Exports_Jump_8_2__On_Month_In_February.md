The value of non-oil domestic exports in Singapore jumped a seasonally
adjusted 8.2 percent on month in February, Statistics Singapore said on
Wednesday.

That beat forecasts for a decline of 1.0 percent following the
downwardly revised 6.9 percent increase in January (originally 7.0
percent).

On a yearly basis, exports gained 4.2 percent - shy of expectations for
6.6 percent following the downwardly revised 12.7 percent increase in
the previous month (originally 12.8 percent).

Total trade was down 3.3 percent on year after slipping 1.9 percent in
January. It was up 6.0 percent on month after rising 5.7 percent in
January.
