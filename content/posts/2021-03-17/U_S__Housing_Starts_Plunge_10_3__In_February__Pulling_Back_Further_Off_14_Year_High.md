New residential construction in the U.S. showed a substantial decrease
in the month of February, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Wednesday, with housing starts extending the sharp
pullback seen in the previous month.

The report said housing starts plummeted by 10.3 percent to an annual
rate of 1.421 million in February after slumping by 5.1 percent to a
revised rate of 1.584 million in January.

Economists had expected housing starts to decrease by 0.9 percent to a
rate of 1.565 million from the 1.580 million originally reported for the
previous month.

With the steep drop, housing starts continued to give back ground after
reaching a fourteen-year high of 1.670 million in December.

The sharp decline in housing starts came as single-family starts tumbled
by 8.5 percent to a rate of 1.040 million, while multi-family starts
dove by 15.0 percent to a rate of 381,000.

"The pace of starts was likely held down by severe weather, particularly
in the South, which accounts for over half of all housing starts," said
Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics.

The report also showed a bigger than expected decrease in building
permits, which plummeted by 10.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.682
million in February after spiking by 10.7 percent to a revised rate of
1.886 million in January.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, had been
expected to tumble by 7.0 percent to a rate of 1.750 million from the
1.881 million originally reported for the previous month.

The substantial decrease came after building permits reached their
highest level since May of 2006 in the previous month.

Single-family permits slumped by 10.0 percent to a rate of 1.143
million, while multi-family permits plunged by 12.5 percent to a rate of
539,000.

"We expect the pace of housing starts to moderate in 2021 as
homebuilders confront constraints including high lumber prices and
shortages of lots and labor," said Vanden Houten. "However, we think the
February data overstates any actual weakness in the housing market."

The National Association of Home Builders released a report on Tuesday
showing a slightly bigger than expected decrease in U.S. homebuilder
confidence in the month of March.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell to 82 in
March after inching up to 84 in February. Economists had expected the
index to edge down to 83.
