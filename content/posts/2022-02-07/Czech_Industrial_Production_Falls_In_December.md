The Czech Republic's industrial production dropped in December, after
rising in the previous month, preliminary data from the Czech
Statistical Office showed Monday.

Industrial production decreased 2.1 percent year-on-year following a 1.6
percent rise in the previous month.

Manufacturing decreased 2.2 percent annually after a 1.1 percent gain in
November. Output fell 0.9 percent in the mining and quarrying, while
production grew 4.8 percent in the utilities sector.

Compared to the previous month, industrial production fell 2.9 percent
in December.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that construction
output grew 8.1 percent year-on-year and 1.8 percent monthly, in
December.

In the whole year 2021, industrial production rose 6.4 percent.

"Compared to the previous year, the production volume increased in an
overall majority of economic activities of industry in a virtually even
manner," Radek Matejka, director of the farm and industrial statistics
department, said.

"However, due to difficulties in production of motor vehicles, the pre-
covidÂ level has not been attained."
