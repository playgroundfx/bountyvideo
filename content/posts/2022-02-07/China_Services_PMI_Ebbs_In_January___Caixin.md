The services sector in China continued to expand in January, albeit at a
slower pace, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Monday with a PMI
score of 51.4.

That's down from 53.1 in December, although it remains well above the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The rate of growth was the slowest seen in the current five-month
sequence of expansion. Companies often mentioned that activity rose due
to higher amounts of new [business][1]. However, others commented that
the pandemic, and efforts to contain the virus, had weighed on overall
growth.

Total new orders rose marginally at the start of 2022, with the upturn
the second-slowest seen since sales returned to growth last September.
The softer rise in new work was in part due to weaker external demand.
New export orders fell for the first time in four months and at the
quickest pace since October 2020. A number of companies mentioned that
increased COVID-19 cases overseas had weighed on foreign demand.

The survey also showed that the composite index slipped to 50.1 in
January from 53.0 in December.

Composite new work meanwhile fell slightly for the first time since last
August, driven by a modest fall in new business at goods producers and
slower growth of service sector order books. Total new export sales fell
at the quickest rate for 20 months, with lower foreign demand seen
across both monitored sectors.
