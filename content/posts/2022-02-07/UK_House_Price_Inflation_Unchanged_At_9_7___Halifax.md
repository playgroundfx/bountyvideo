UK house prices annual rate of increase remained steady at the start of
the year, while the monthly gain was the weakest in seven months, survey
data from the Lloyds Bank subsidiary Halifax showed Monday.

The house price index rose 9.7 percent year-on-year, same as in
December.

Compared to the previous month, house prices rose 0.3 percent, which was
the slowest increase since June last year, when prices decreased. In
December, house prices climbed 1.1 percent.

The average house price hit a new record high of GBP 276,759 in January
versus GBP 275,996 in December.

"Following the peak activity of 2021, transaction volumes are returning
to more normal levels," Halifax Managing Director Russell Galley said.

"Affordability remains at [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low levels as house price rises
continue to outstrip earnings growth."

Galley said younger generations still face significant barriers to home
ownership as deposit requirements remain challenging despite record
levels of first-time buyers stepping onto the ladder last year.

Halifax expects the situation to become more acute in the short-term as
household budgets face even greater pressure from an increase in the
cost of living, and rises in interest rates begin to feed through to
mortgage rates.

"While the limited supply of new housing stock to the market will
continue to provide some support to house prices, it remains likely that
the rate of house price growth will slow considerably over the next
year," Galley added.
