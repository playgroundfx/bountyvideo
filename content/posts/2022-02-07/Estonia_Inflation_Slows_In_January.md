Estonia's consumer price inflation slowed in January despite the sharp
increases in housing and transport costs, Statistics Estonia reported
Monday.

Consumer price inflation eased to 11.3 percent from 12.2 percent in
December.

Cost of goods advanced 9 percent annually and that of services surged 16
percent from the previous year. Housing costs advanced 31.5 percent and
transport cost was up 17.1 percent.

Both transport and food and non-alcoholic beverages contributed a fifth
of the index rise.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged down 0.1 percent, in contrast
to the 3.1 percent rise in the previous month.  
  
Compared to December, the consumer price index was affected the most by
price decreases of electricity and pipeline gas, price increase of food
and the sales of clothing and footwear.

"The main reason for lower prices of electricity and pipeline gas is the
government decision to put a price cap on these and set the volumes sold
at capped prices," Viktoria Trasanov, leading analyst at Statistics
Estonia, said. In addition, in January, electricity was cheaper than in
December.
