The private sector in Singapore continued to expand in January, albeit
at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Monday with a PMI score of 54.4.

That's down from 55.1 in December, although it remains well above the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Higher demand for Singaporean goods and services drove output higher for
the fourteenth straight month in January. Better demand was observed
across various industries, according to panelists, with the transport,
information & communications [technology][1] sector seeing the highest
growth in new orders.

New orders from abroad also continued to rise at the start of 2022,
accelerating to the fastest pace on record. Anecdotal evidence suggested
that improvements in global demand were seen while higher COVID-19
infections also benefitted related industries such as the healthcare and
medical sectors.
