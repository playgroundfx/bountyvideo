South Africa's producer price inflation increased unexpectedly in
February after easing in the previous month, figures from Statistics
South Africa showed on Thursday.

The producer price index rose 10.5 percent year-on-year in February,
following a 10.1 percent increase in January. Economists had expected an
inflation of 10.0 percent.

In December, producer price inflation was 10.8 percent.

The main contribution for the increase in prices came from coke,
petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic products, metals, machinery,
equipment and computing equipment, and food products, beverages and
tobacco products in February.

Producer prices for the mining industry gained 6.4 percent annually in
February and prices for electricity and water increased 12.9 percent.

Prices for agriculture, forestry and fishing, and intermediate goods
rose by 8.0 percent and 19.3 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 1.1 percent in February.
Economists had forecast a rise of 0.9 percent.
