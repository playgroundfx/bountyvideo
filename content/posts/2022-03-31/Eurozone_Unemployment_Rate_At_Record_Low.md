The euro area unemployment rate dropped to a record low in February
ahead of the war in Ukraine, official data revealed on Thursday.

The jobless rate fell to 6.8 percent in February from 6.9 percent in
January, Eurostat reported. The rate was forecast to drop to 6.7 percent
from January's initial estimated rate of 6.8 percent.

Data showed that the number of unemployed decreased by 181,000 from the
prior month to 11.155 million in February. From the last year,
unemployment decreased by 2.150 million.

The unemployment among youth aged below 25 dropped to 14.0 percent in
February from 14.3 percent in January. Youth unemployment totaled 2.101
million in February.

The rapid recovery of the job market is set to slow from here on, Bert
Colijn, an ING economist, said.

The war adds uncertainty to the employment outlook and could result in
delayed new hiring, Colijn added. This is especially the case in
manufacturing, as the industrial sentiment survey already revealed
declining hiring expectations in March.

Still, the labor market remains very robust at current levels of
unemployment, the economist noted.

In the EU27, the jobless rate came in at 6.2 percent in February, down
from 6.3 percent in the prior month. In the same period last year, the
unemployment rate was 7.5 percent.

Germany's unemployment decreased at a slower pace in March, data
released by the Federal Labor Agency showed Thursday.

The number of people out of work decreased 18,000 in March, following
February's 32,000 fall. Economists had forecast a monthly drop of
20,000. The jobless rate remained unchanged at 5.0 percent in March, in
line with expectations.

Elsewhere, data from Istat showed that Italy's unemployment rate dropped
slightly to 8.5 percent in February from 8.6 percent in January. The
youth unemployment rate was 24.2 percent, down from 24.8 percent a month
ago.
