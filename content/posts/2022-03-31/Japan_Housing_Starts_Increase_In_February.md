Japan's housing starts increased at a faster pace in February, data from
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism showed on
Thursday.

Housing starts rose 6.3 percent yearly in February, following a 2.1
percent increase in January.

Economists had forecast an annual growth of 1.1 percent. This was the
highest since October last year.

Annualized housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted 872,000 in
February from 820,000 in the previous month.

Data also showed that construction orders received by big 50 contractors
declined 2.3 percent year-on-year in February, after an 11.0 percent
increase in January. Construction orders dropped for the first time in
six months.
