France's household spending rebounded in February, but the growth was
less than expected, preliminary data from the statistical office INSEE
showed Thursday.  
  
Household spending increased 0.8 percent month-on-month following a
revised 2.0 percent fall in January. Economists had expected a 1.2
percent increase.  
  
INSEE said the latest increase was driven by the clear rebound in
manufactured goods consumption that rose 2.2 percent monthly in February
after a 2.9 percent slump in January.

The rebound in manufactured goods was primarily led the strong recovery
in consumption in clothing and textiles.

Food consumption decreased at a slower pace of 0.2 percent versus 1.5
percent in the previous month.  
  
Energy consumption also fell at a slower pace of 0.3 percent compared to
1.2 percent in January.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, household consumption decreased 2.3 percent in
February.
