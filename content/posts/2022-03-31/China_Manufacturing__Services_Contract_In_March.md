China's manufacturing and service sectors contracted in March due to the
lockdown, survey results from the National Bureau of Statistics showed
on Thursday.

The non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.4 in March
from 51.6 in February. A score below 50.0 indicates contraction in the
sector.

Similarly, the manufacturing PMI came in at 49.5, down from 50.2 in the
previous month.

Although manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs fell below 50.0 due to
lockdowns for mass-testing in big cities, there will be a rebound in
April, Iris Pang, an economist at ING said.

Most of the population should be able to return to work as usual after
this lockdown, the economist noted. One uncertainty is that people with
positive Covid cases found from this round of mass tests could remain in
isolation facilities in April.
