German unemployment decreased in March but at a slower pace, data from
the Federal Employment Agency showed on Thursday.

The number of people out of work decreased 18,000 in March, following
February's 32,000 fall. Economists had forecast a monthly drop of
20,000.  
  
The jobless rate remained unchanged at 5.0 percent in March, in line
with expectations.

Unemployment is falling and employment is rising as a result of the
easing of [coronavirus][1] restrictions and the beginning spring
revival, Daniel Terzenbach, an official at Federal Employment Agency
said.

The consequences of the war in Ukraine are currently only reflected in
isolated cases in the labor market data, Terzenbach added.

Data released by the statistical office, earlier in the day, showed that
the unemployment rate held steady at seasonally adjusted 3.1 percent in
February. In the same period last year, the rate was 3.9 percent.

According to calculations based on the labor force survey, the number of
unemployed decreased by 20,400, or 1.5 percent, to 1.34 million in
February.
