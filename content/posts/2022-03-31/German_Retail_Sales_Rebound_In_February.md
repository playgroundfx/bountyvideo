Germany's retail sales grew in February, albeit at a slower than
expected pace, for the first time in three months though decades-high
inflation and caution regarding the economic outlook in the backdrop of
the Russia-Ukraine war is set to dampen sales in the coming months.  
  
Retail sales rose 0.3 percent from January, when sales were unchanged
after revision, preliminary data from Destatis showed Thursday.
Economists had forecast 0.5 percent increase in sales for February.  
  
Initially, a 2.0 percent growth was estimated for January. In December,
sales declined a revised 2.3 percent.  
  
Retail sales were 4.4 percent higher when compared to the pre-Covid
month of February 2020.  
  
Compared to the same month last year, retail sales increased 7.0 percent
in February, which was faster than the 6.1 percent increase economists
had forecast. In January, sales grew 10.4 percent.  
  
The strong increase in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) was partly due to the partial
lockdown in February 2021 and the many consumers had brought major
purchases forward to 2020 due to the temporary reduction in VAT. These
developments particularly affected the non-food retail sector at the
beginning of 2021, Destatis said.

Retail sales in the biggest euro area [economy][1] are set for a
contraction in the first quarter, economists at Daiwa Capital Markets
said.  
  
Official data showed this week that Germany's consumer price inflation
jumped to 7.3 percent, its highest level in over four decades in March
as the Russia-Ukraine war led to a surge in energy prices.

Consumer confidence is set to weaken sharply in April, hurt
significantly by the concerns over the war in Ukraine, the latest survey
from GfK showed this week.  
  
Purchasing power is hurt by the escalating inflation that is mainly
driven by higher prices of gas, heating oil and gasoline, GfK said.

Elsewhere on Thursday, data from the Federal Labor Agency showed that
unemployment decreased a less-than-expected 18,000 in March. The jobless
rate was steady at 5.0 percent.

In February, grocery sales edged up 0.1 percent from the previous month,
but fell 5.1 percent from a year ago, Destatis figures revealed.  
  
Non-food sales rose 0.9 percent monthly and 16.2 percent annually,
mainly due to the base effect.  
  
Within this group, sales of textiles, clothing, shoes and leather goods
decreased 0.6 percent from the previous month and those of furniture,
household appliances and construction supplies shrunk 0.3 percent.  
  
Online and mail-order sales logged 1.8 percent monthly increase, but
fell 7.9 percent from the same month last year.
