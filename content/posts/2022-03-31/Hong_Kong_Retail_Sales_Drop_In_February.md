Hong Kong's retail sales declined for the first time in thirteen months
in February, figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Thursday.

The retail sales volume dropped 17.6 percent year-on-year in February,
after a 1.5 percent rise in January.

The value of retail sales decreased 14.6 percent annually in February,
after a 4.0 percent growth in the preceding month.

Sales value of jewelry, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts declined
33.6 percent annually in February.

Sales of clothing, footwear and allied products decreased 39.0 percent
and those of consumer durable goods fell 19.5 percent.

Sales for department stores and fuels decreased by 19.2 percent and 2.2
percent, respectively.

"The value of retail sales fell sharply in February over a year earlier
as the rapid worsening of local epidemic situation and further
tightening of anti-epidemic measures in response led to a drastic fall
in people flow and weaker consumption sentiment," a government spokesman
said.
