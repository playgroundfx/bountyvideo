The Netherlands' consumer confidence improved in June after weakening
sharply in the previous month, after the lockdown restrictions imposed
to prevent the spread of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, were eased,
survey data from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday.

The consumer confidence index rose to -27 from -31 in May. In April, the
reading was -22.

The additional measurement carried out in the second half of June showed
a confidence reading of -26 as the willingness to buy was less negative,
while the view on the economic situation remained unchanged, the agency
said.

In June, the willingness to buy indicator climbed to -8 from -11 and
consumers were less negative about their personal financial situation in
the coming 12 months.

However, households felt it was not yet time to make big purchases. They
were less positive regarding their past economic situation.

The indicator reflecting consumers' view on the present economic
situation remained unchanged at -52. Their assessment of the 12-month
outlook improved.
