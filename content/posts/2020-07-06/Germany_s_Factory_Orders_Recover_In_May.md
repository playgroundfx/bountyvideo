Germany's factory orders recovered on robust demand from both domestic
and foreign [markets][1] in May as containment measures taken to curb
the spread of coronavirus were relaxed, data released by Destatis
revealed Monday.

Factory orders advanced 10.4 percent month-on-month in May, reversing a
sharp 26.2 percent fall posted in April. This was the first increase in
four months but weaker than economists' forecast of 15 percent increase.

Domestic orders increased 12.3 percent and foreign orders rose 8.8
percent in May. Orders from euro area registered a double digit growth
of 20.9 percent, while that from other countries gained only 2 percent.

The [economy][2] ministry said incoming orders indicate that the
industrial recession has bottomed out.

The still low order level also shows that the catch-up process is far
from over, the ministry said. The comparatively small increase in orders
from non-European countries also indicates that the global economic
environment will initially remain difficult.

Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said the lifting of the lockdown
measures has brought V-shaped surges in activity but the return to pre-
crisis levels will not be easy.

Excluding major orders, industrial orders grew 8.9 percent in May, data
showed.  
Capital goods orders surged 20.3 percent and orders for consumer goods
moved up 4.7 percent. New orders for intermediate goods rose only 0.4
percent.

New orders in the automotive industry logged a marked expansion from a
very low level seen in April. But orders were still about 47 percent
below February 2020.

On a yearly basis, manufacturing orders plunged 29.3 percent in May,
slower than the 36.9 percent decrease posted in April.

Further, data showed that manufacturing turnover increased 10.6 percent
month-on-month, in contrast to a fall of 22.4 percent in April.
