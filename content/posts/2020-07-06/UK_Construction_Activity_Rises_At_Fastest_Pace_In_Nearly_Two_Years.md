UK construction activity rose at the fastest pace in nearly two years in
June amid a phased restart of work on site as the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, lockdown restrictions were eased thus boosting output volumes
and [business][2] confidence, the purchasing managers' survey data from
IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Total
Activity Index surged to 55.3 in June, from 28.9 in May.

Economists had forecast a score of 47. A reading above 50 suggests
growth in the sector.

The latest reading signaled the steepest pace of expansion since July
2018, IHS Markit said.

The reopening of the UK construction supply chain following stoppages
and business closures during the early stages of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic boosted activity.

"As the first major part of the UK [economy][3] to begin a phased return
to work, the strong rebound in construction activity provides hope to
other sectors that have suffered through the lockdown period," Tim
Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.

"However, the ongoing reductions in staffing numbers seen in June
provide a stark reminder that underlying conditions across the sector
are a long way off returning to those seen before the public [health][4]
emergency," Moore added.

In June, residential building was best performer amid various
construction sectors with nearly 46 percent of survey respondents
reporting an increase in housing activity.

The latest expansion of residential construction work was the steepest
for just under five years, the survey found.

Commercial work and civil engineering activity also returned to growth
in June, but the rates of expansion were softer than seen for house
building.

Demand stabilized after three months of sharp declines, led by new work
related to infrastructure projects, and purchasing activity increased at
the fastest pace since December 2015.

However, employment levels continued to fall as concerns over the
longer-term demand outlook led to cautious hiring policies. There were
also redundancies alongside furlough arrangements.

Business expectations for the year ahead climbed to its highest since
February amid a boost from the reopening of work on site, but were
relatively subdued.

Exactly 46 percent of the survey panel anticipate a rise in business
activity, while 31 percent forecast a reduction on concerns about the
wider UK economic outlook, the survey found.

Purchasing costs rose at the fastest pace thus far this year as severe
supply chain disruptions continued.
