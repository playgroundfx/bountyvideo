Raising interest rates in the second half of this year or even next year
would be too risky, Eryk Lon, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee
of the National Bank of Poland, said in an article on Monday.

Lon has called for interest rate cuts consistently and is seen as the
most dovish member on the rate-setting body.

The central bank has cut the rate by a cumulative 140 points in three
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sessions since mid-March this year after the outbreak of the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic.

The key reference rate is now at a record low 0.10 percent. The rate was
left unchanged in June.

Elsewhere on Monday, minutes of the April 8 [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session showed that
seven [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers, including Lon, voted in favor to reduce the key
interest rate by 50 basis points to 0.50 percent, while Lukasz Hardt
voted against the decision.
