Analysts at Goldman Sachs on Monday cut the US economic growth forecast
for this year to a contraction of 4.6 percent versus a 4.2 percent
shrinkage predicted earlier.

"The healthy rebound in consumer services spending seen since mid-April
now appears likely to stall in July and August as authorities impose
further restrictions to contain the virus spread," analysts wrote in a
note.

The investment bank expects the US [economy][1] to be back on track in
September.

The bank continues to be optimistic of a strong rebound next year and
left the growth forecast for 2021 unchanged at 5.8 percent.
