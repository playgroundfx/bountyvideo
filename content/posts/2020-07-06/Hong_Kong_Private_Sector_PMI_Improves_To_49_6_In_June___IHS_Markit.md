The private sector in Hong Kong continued to contract in June, albeit at
a much slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Markey revealed on Monday
with a PMI score of 49.6.

That's up from 43.9 in May, although it remains beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders fell at the slowest rate in more
than two years. Employment levels were broadly stable and input cost
inflation returned.

Firms were less pessimistic about the year-ahead outlook during June
than in May, with confidence rising to a five-month high.
