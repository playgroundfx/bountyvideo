Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence improved for the third straight month in
July but outlook remained weak as the [economy][1] is expected to
recover only slowly, survey results from the behavioral research firm
Sentix showed Monday.

As member countries began easing the covid-19 containment measures,
retail sales rebounded at a faster than expected pace in May, official
data showed.

The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index improved to -18.2 in July from -24.8 in
June. However, the score was weaker than economists' forecast of -10.9.

Assessment of current situation improved, while expectations weakened in
July. The current situation index rose to -49.5 in July from -61.5 in
June. Meanwhile, the expectations indicator fell to 19.5 from 21.8 a
month ago.

In Germany, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index came in at -10.5 versus -17.2
in the previous month.

Retail trade volume advanced 17.8 percent on a monthly basis in May, in
contrast to a 12.1 percent decline in April. This was also faster than
the expected 15 percent increase.

Sales of food, drinks and tobacco gained moderately by 2.2 percent,
while non-food product sales surged 34.5 percent in May. Sales of
automotive fuel in specialized stores advanced 38.4 percent.

On a yearly basis, retail sales dropped at a slower pace of 5.1 percent,
following a sharp 19.6 percent decrease in April. Sales were expected to
fall 7.5 percent.

The bounce back in retail sales shows that retention of income
throughout the lockdown has helped to kickstart the recovery in spending
as businesses reopen, Bert Colijn, an ING economist said. An encouraging
start, but the road ahead will be a lot bumpier.
