South Korea had a current account surplus of $2.29 billion in May, the
Bank of Korea said on Tuesday - following the $3.12 billion deficit in
April.

The goods account surplus narrowed to $2.50 billion, compared to $5.50
billion in May 2019. The services account deficit fell to $0.48 billion
from $0.95 billion in May last year, owing to an improvement in the
travel and transport account.

The primary income account surplus narrowed from $1.29 billion a year
ago to $0.54 billion in May of this year, in line with a decrease in the
income from dividends.
