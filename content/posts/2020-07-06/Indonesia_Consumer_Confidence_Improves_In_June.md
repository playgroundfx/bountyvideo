Indonesia's households were less pessimistic in June, thanks to stronger
expectations on the future economic situation, as the restrictions
imposed to prevent the spread of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, were
eased, survey results from the Bank Indonesia showed on Monday.

The consumer confidence index rose to 83.8 in June from 77.8 in May.
Sentiment improved among all categories of respondents, the bank said.

Bank Indonesia attributed the latest improvement in consumer confidence
mainly to stronger expectations for the economic conditions in the next
6 months, which were in line with forecasts for the easing of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the country.

Expectations for growth in [business][2] activity in the next 6 months
increased. However, households' view on the current economic situation
remained low and weak.
