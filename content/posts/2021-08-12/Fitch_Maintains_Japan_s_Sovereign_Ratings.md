Fitch Ratings maintained the sovereign ratings of Japan at 'A' with a
'negative' outlook on Wednesday.

The agency said the ratings balance the strengths of an advanced and
wealthy [economy][1], with correspondingly robust governance standards
and public institutions, against weak medium-term growth prospects and
very high public debt.

Fitch retained a 'negative' outlook, given uncertainty about the medium-
term macroeconomic and fiscal outlook from the continuing pandemic.

Fitch expects the economy to grow 2.5 percent this year and 3.0 percent
in 2022, as Japan recovers from a 4.6 percent contraction in 2020. The
recovery has been delayed by weak domestic demand owing to
[coronavirus][2] containment measures.

Risks to forecasts are to the downside, however, as an ongoing fifth
Covid-19 wave and a state of emergency in several prefectures may
further delay the recovery, Fitch said.

Inflation is expected to remain subdued, averaging 0.3 percent in 2021
and 0.7 percent in 2022, given muted wage dynamics and entrenched low
inflation expectations.  
  
The rating agency expects the Bank of Japan to maintain its current
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings over the next few years, with a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate of
-0.10 percent, yield curve control (with a 0 percent target for the
10-year yield), and quantitative and qualitative easing through large-
scale asset purchases.
