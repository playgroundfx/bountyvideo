The UK [economy][1] recovered strongly in the second quarter, following
the easing of coronavirus restrictions, the first quarterly estimates
from the Office for National Statistics showed on Thursday.

Gross domestic product grew 4.8 percent sequentially in the second
quarter, reversing a 1.6 percent fall in the first quarter. The rate
matched economists' expectations.

Nonetheless, the level of GDP was 4.4 percent below its pre-pandemic
level.

In June, GDP growth improved to 1 percent from 0.6 percent in May. This
was faster than the economists' forecast of 0.8 percent and marked the
fifth consecutive month of growth.

On the production-side, services continued to be the main contributor to
GDP's recovery in June 2021, growing 1.5 percent in June, following a
revised 0.7 percent growth in May.

Production output fell 0.7 percent in June, as planned temporary
closures for maintenance of oil field production sites once again hit
output. At the same time, manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent, after
rising 0.1 percent in May.

Construction output contracted for a third consecutive month, with
output down by 1.3 percent in June.

Data revealed that [business][2] investment increased 2.4 percent in the
second quarter, though it was still 15.3 percent below its pre-pandemic
levels.

Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade gap widened to
GBP 11.98 billion in June from GBP 9.6 billion in May. At the same time,
the trade in services logged a surplus of GBP 9.47 billion, slightly up
from GBP 9.44 billion in the prior month.

As a result, total trade balance posted a shortfall of GBP 2.5 billion
in June versus -GBP 163 million a month ago.
