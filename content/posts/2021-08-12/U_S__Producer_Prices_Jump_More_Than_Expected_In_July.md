After yesterday's report showing U.S. consumer prices rose in line with
estimates, the Labor Department released a separate report on Thursday
showing U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in the month
of July.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
surged up by 1.0 percent in July, matching the jump seen in the previous
month. Economists had expected producer prices to climb by 0.6 percent.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices advanced by 0.9 percent in July after rising by 0.5 percent in
June. Core prices were expected to show another 0.5 percent increase.
