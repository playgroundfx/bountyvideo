First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits saw a modest decrease
in the week ended August 7th, according to a report released by the
Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims edged down to 375,000, a decrease
of 12,000 from the previous week's revised level of 387,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 375,000 from the
385,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average crept up to 396,250, an increase of 1,750 from the previous
week's revised average of 394,500.

The report said continuing claims, a reading on the number of people
receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, slid by 114,000 to 2.866
million in the week ended July 31st.

With the decrease, continuing claims fell to their lowest level since
hitting 1.770 million in the week ended March 14, 2020.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also dropped to a more
than one-year low of 3,101,000, a decrease of 99,750 from the previous
week's revised average of 3,200,750.

Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics, called the
decrease in continuing claims a "sign that more workers may be returning
to the labor market."

"The course of the [coronavirus][1] Delta variant will weigh on how
quickly labor supply recovers to meet record labor demand, but assuming
there are no widespread lockdown measures, we expect the [economy][2] to
add more than 7mn jobs this year," Vanden Houten said.

Last Friday, a more closely watched report released by the Labor
Department showed U.S. employment soared by more than expected in the
month of July.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment spiked by 943,000
jobs in July after surging by an upwardly revised 938,000 jobs in June.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 870,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 850,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

With the stronger than expected job growth, the unemployment rate slid
to 5.4 percent in July from 5.9 percent in June, falling to its lowest
level since March of 2020.
