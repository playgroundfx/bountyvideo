The manufacturing sector in New Zealand continued to expand in July. And
at a faster pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Friday
with a Performance of Manufacturing Index score or 62.6.

That's up from 60.7 in June and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This was the third time in five months that the PMI posted a result over
60.0. While the key sub-index values of Production (66.0) and New Orders
(65.0) both showed further expansion from June, Employment (58.3)
recorded its highest ever result over the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the survey.
