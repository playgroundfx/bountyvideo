First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits saw a modest decrease
in the week ended August 7th, according to a report released by the
Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims edged down to 375,000, a decrease
of 12,000 from the previous week's revised level of 387,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 375,000 from the
385,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average crept up to 396,250, an increase of 1,750 from the previous
week's revised average of 394,500.
