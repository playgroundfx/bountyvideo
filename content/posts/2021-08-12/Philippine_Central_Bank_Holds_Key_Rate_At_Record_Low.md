The Philippine central bank decided to keep its key interest rate at a
record low for the sixth straight meeting on Thursday.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas decided to hold
the key interest rate, which is the overnight reverse repurchase
facility rate, steady at 2.00 percent.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.

"The Monetary Board is of the view that the expected path of inflation
and downside risks to domestic economic growth warrant keeping monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings unchanged," the bank said.

The board said it remains keen on sustaining monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support for
as long as necessary in order for the momentum of economic recovery to
gain more traction.  
  
The bank forecast inflation to settle slightly above the upper end of
the target band of 2-4 percent this year. However, inflation is forecast
to ease towards the midpoint of the target range in 2022 and 2023.

With inflation likely to ease further and the [economy][1] in desperate
need of more support, it is only a matter of time before the Bank is
compelled to ease [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

The economist said the BSP will cut rates by a further 50 basis points
in the second half of the year, with the first in September.

Official data released earlier this week showed that the economy
rebounded 11.8 percent in the second quarter, the biggest expansion
since the fourth quarter of 1988. However, GDP fell 1.3 percent
sequentially.
