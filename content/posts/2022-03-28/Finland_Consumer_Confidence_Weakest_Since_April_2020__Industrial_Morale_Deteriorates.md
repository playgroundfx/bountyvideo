Finland's consumer confidence deteriorated to the lowest since April
2020, and industrial morale was the weakest since May last year as
expectations eroded sharply due to the war in Ukraine, separate survey
results showed on Monday.

The consumer sentiment index decreased to -10.5 in March from 0.5 in
February, Statistics Finland said.

The latest reading was the weakest since April 2020, when it was -13.9.

Only in April 2020 and in the end of 2008, the consumer confidence were
weaker than in March, the agency said.

Data was collected from 1,014 persons between March 1 and 20.

All the four components weakened in March, expectations concerning
Finland's [economy][1] in 12 months deteriorated most sharply.

The expectations index crashed to -31.0 from -3.1 in the previous month.

Separately, data from the Confederation of Finnish Industries showed
that the manufacturing confidence index fell to 15 in March from a
revised 21.0 in February. The reading was above the long-term average of
1.

The construction confidence indicator fell to 4 in March from 11 in the
previous month. The reading was above the long-term average of -6.

The service sector confidence indicator weakened to 14 in March from 18
in the previous month.

The retail trade confidence fell eight points to -6 in March from 2 in
the prior month, which was above the long-term average of -1.

Operating environment has become very difficult for businesses due to
high uncertainty, high inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war, EK Director
Sami Pakarinen said. Hiring intentions in the construction sector cooled
rapidly as the war began, the official added.
