The Bank of Japan offered to buy unlimited amount of 10-year Japanese
Government Bonds after yields rose to the upper end of the target range.

In a statement released Monday, the central bank said it will buy
unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at 0.25 percent for three consecutive
days starting March 29.

Earlier, the central bank had conducted unlimited JGB purchases at 0.25
percent on February 14.

Despite the intervention, the yields on the government bonds continued
to rise against the hawkish stance of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The yield on 10-year JGBs rose to 0.24 percent on Monday and the
Japanese yen declined to a six-year low against the U.S. dollar.

The currency depreciated to 123.66 against the greenback earlier today.
