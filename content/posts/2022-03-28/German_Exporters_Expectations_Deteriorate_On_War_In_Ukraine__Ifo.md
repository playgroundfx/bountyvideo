Confidence among German exporters declined dramatically due to the war
in Ukraine, survey results from the ifo Institute showed on Monday.

The ifo Export Expectations index slipped to minus 2.3 points from +17.0
points in February. This was the lowest score since June 2020.

The institute said the only other time the index suffered a steeper
decline was at the beginning of the [coronavirus][1] crisis in April
2020.

Regarding the coming six months, exporters were significantly more
pessimistic, especially those with economic ties to Russia. The growth
in exports will slow down noticeably, Clemens Fuest, President of the
ifo Institute, said.

Export expectations fell across all manufacturing industries. Car
manufacturers and their suppliers suffered a significant setback and are
expecting exports to decline.

Meanwhile, the electrical and electronics industry continued to
anticipate rising international sales, but to a lesser extent than
recently.
