Hong Kong's merchandise exports and imports rose at softer paces in
February and the trade deficit widened, data from the Census and
Statistics Department showed on Thursday.

Exports rose 0.9 percent year-on-year in February, after an 18.4 percent
increase in January.

Imports gained 6.2 percent annually in February, after a 9.6 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit rose to HK$32.108 billion in February from HK$14.699
billion in the same month last year. In January, the surplus was
HK$6.648 billion.

"Taking the first two months of 2022 together to remove the distortion
caused by the difference in timing of the Lunar New Year, the value of
merchandise exports continued to post double-digit growth over a year
earlier," a government spokesman said.

On a month-on-month basis, exports shrank 31.7 percent and imports
decreased 23.6 percent in February.
