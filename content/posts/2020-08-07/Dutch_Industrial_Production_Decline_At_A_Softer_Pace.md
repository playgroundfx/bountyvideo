Dutch industrial production declined sharply in June, albeit at a softer
pace, figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.

Industrial production decreased 9.7 percent year-on-year in June,
following an 11.9 percent fall in May.

Among the eight largest categories, the production in the machinery
repaid and installation sector declined the most in June, but at a
slower pace compared to previous month.

Production was lower in most of the industry [business][1] classes,
except in building materials and tobacco, the agency said.

Production of repair maintenance and services declined 28.1 percent in
June and means of transportation fell 17.9 percent.

On a seasonally and working-day adjusted basis, industrial production
rose 2.1 percent in June.
