UK house prices increased for the first time in five months in July
driven by pent-up demand, data from the Lloyds Bank subsidiary Halifax
and IHS Markit showed Friday.

House prices grew 1.6 percent on a monthly basis in July after staying
flat in the previous month. This was the first rise since February.

During three months to July, house prices were 0.2 percent lower than in
the preceding three months. On a yearly basis, house prices advanced 3.8
percent.  
  
The latest data adds to the emerging view that the market is
experiencing a surprising spike post lockdown, Russell Galley, Managing
Director, Halifax, said.  
  
As pent-up demand from the period of lockdown is released into a largely
open housing market, a low supply of available homes is helping to exert
upwards pressure on house prices, Galley noted.

However, looking further ahead, there is still a great deal of
uncertainty around the lasting impact of the pandemic. As government
support measures come to an end, the resulting impact on the
macroeconomic environment, and in turn the housing market, will start to
become more apparent, Galley added.
