Australia's [economy][1] is set to log a slow recovery given the ongoing
spread of the coronavirus and the response to contain it, the Reserve
Bank of Australia said in its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy,
released Friday.  
  
According to baseline scenario of RBA, GDP is expected to contract by
around 6 percent over the year to December 2020, but then grow by around
5 percent over 2021.

The outlook for 2020 was largely unchanged from the previous projection
but downgraded the projection for 2021 from 6 percent.

"We now think that, even though the initial contraction was smaller, the
subsequent recovery is likely to be more protracted and progress on
reducing unemployment will be slower," Luci Ellis, RBA Assistant
Governor, said.

"The recovery is expected to be slow and uneven, and GDP will probably
take several years to return to the trend path expected prior to the
virus outbreak," Ellis said.

The recent outbreak of the [coronavirus][2] in Victoria and the
associated introduction of restrictions on activity are likely to reduce
national GDP growth by at least 2 percentage points in the September
quarter.

A contraction in demand represents an enormous shock to the labor
market, Ellis noted.

The unemployment rate is expected to rise to almost 10 percent over the
next six months and gradually decline to around 7 percent over the
latter part of the forecast period.

Underlying inflation is expected to remain below 2 percent over the next
couple of years.
