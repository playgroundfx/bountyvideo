Hungary's trade surplus increased in June, amid a fall in both exports
and imports, data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed
on Friday.

The trade surplus increased to EUR 697 million in June from EUR 496
million in the same month last year.

A moderate decline was observed in both directions of euro-denominated
external trade in goods than in April-May as the direct negative impacts
of [coronavirus][1] pandemic eased, the agency said.

Exports fell 3.1 percent year-on-year in June, following a 28.6 percent
decrease in May.

Imports decreased 5.7 percent annually in June, following a 24.5 percent
fall in the preceding month.
