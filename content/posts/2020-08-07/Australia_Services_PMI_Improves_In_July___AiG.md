The services sector in Australia continued to contract in July, albeit
at a slower rate, the latest survey from the Australian Industry Group
revealed on Friday with a Performance of Service Index score of 44.0.

That's up sharply from 31.5 in June, although it remains beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The Australian PSI continued to indicate contraction in three of the six
services sectors in July. Retail trade and hospitality recovered mildly
in July, with the first monthly result above 50 points since February.

Insufficient businesses were available to respond in two sectors in
July. All activity indicators remained negative in July and all except
inventories contracted at a slower pace. Business inventories contracted
at a faster pace in July.
