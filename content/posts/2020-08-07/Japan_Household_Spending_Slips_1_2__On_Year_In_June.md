The average of household spending in Japan was down 1.2 percent on year
in June, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Friday - coming in at 273,699 yen.

That beat forecasts for a decline of 7.5 percent following the 16.2
percent tumble in May.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 1,019,095 yen, up
15.6 percent on year.

On a monthly basis, household spending surged 13.0 percent - beating
forecasts for a gain of 7.5 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in the
previous month.
