Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said the unemployment
rate will need to be sustained in "the low 4s" for the [economy][1] to
be considered to be operating at full employment.

A further period of strong employment growth will be required to bring
the unemployment rate sustainably in the low 4s, Lowe told the Economic
Society of Australia via a webinar on Thursday. Underemployment will
also need to decline further.

Citing relationship between income growth and unemployment, Lowe said
tighter labor [markets][2] do generate stronger wage increases - the
laws of supply and demand still work. And second, the relationship seems
to be stronger at unemployment rates below 5 percent, Lowe said.

The central bank strategy is to get the unemployment rate down so that
wages growth picks up and inflation returns in a sustainable way to the
target range.

The RBA expects that it will take until 2024 for inflation to be
sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range.

The governor reiterated that the condition for an increase in the cash
rate depends upon the data, not the date; it is based on inflation
outcomes, not the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/).  
  
The recent decision of the central bank to reduce the bond purchases
from A$5 billion to A$4 billion a week does not represent a withdrawal
of support by the RBA, Lowe added.
