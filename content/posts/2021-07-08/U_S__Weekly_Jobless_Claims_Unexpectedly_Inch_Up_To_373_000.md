After reporting first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits at
their lowest level in over a year in the previous week, the Labor
Department released a report on Thursday showing initial jobless claims
unexpectedly inched higher in the week ended July 3rd.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims crept up to 373,000, an
increase of 2,000 from the previous week's revised level of 371,000.

The uptick surprised economists, who had expected jobless claims to drop
to 350,000 from the 364,000 originally reported for the previous week.
