The value of overall bank lending in Japan was up 1.4 percent on year in
June, the Bank of Japan said on Thursday - coming in at 577.832 trillion
yen.

That follows the downwardly revised 2.8 percent increase in May
(originally 2.9 percent).

Excluding trusts, bank lending rose an annual 0.8 percent to 501.459
trillion yen while lending from trusts climbed 5.6 percent on year to
76.373 trillion yen. Lending from foreign banks jumped an annual 9.3
percent to 3.545 trillion yen.

For the second quarter of 2021, bank lending climbed 3.0 percent on
year, slowing from the 6.1 percent growth in the three months prior.
