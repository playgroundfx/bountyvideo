The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it has adopted a
symmetric 2 percent inflation target that will allow a temporary
overshoot and decided to incorporate climate change considerations into
its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework, following a monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) review that was
launched last year.

"This target is symmetric, meaning negative and positive deviations of
inflation from the target are equally undesirable," the bank said in its
latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) strategy review statement.

That said, when the [economy][1] is operating close to the lower bound
on nominal interest rates, it requires especially forceful or persistent
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action to avoid negative deviations from the inflation
target becoming entrenched, the bank said.

This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately
above target, the ECB added.

"The new formulation removes any possible ambiguity and resolutely
conveys that two per cent is not a ceiling," ECB President Christine
Lagarde said.

The new inflation target is the outcome of a strategy review that the
ECB launched in January 2020, the first such exercise since 2003. This
is the third time the bank changed its price stability definition.

The central bank earlier targeted inflation "below, but close to 2
percent", which Lagarde said was seen as "too elaborate and occasionally
giving rise to misperceptions".

"This longer-term development clearly marks a gradual trend towards
more, even if it is subtle, dovishness," ING economist Carsten Brzeski
said.

The rushed communication and emphasis on higher inflation during
transitory periods could be seen as an attempt to avoid any tapering
discussion over the summer, the economist added.

The first regular monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting of the Governing Council
applying the new strategy is set to be held on July 22. The next
strategy review is expected to take place in 2025.

Policymakers unanimously approved the new monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) strategy,
Lagarde said.  
  
ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers also confirmed that the set of interest rates remains
the primary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) instrument, while other tools such as
forward guidance, asset purchases and longer-term refinancing
operations, will remain an integral part of the central bank's toolkit,
to be used as appropriate.

The Governing Council also confirmed that the Harmonized Index of
Consumer Prices, or HICP, remains the appropriate measure for assessing
price stability.

However, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers recommended the inclusion of the costs related to
owner-occupied housing in the HICP to better represent the inflation
relevant for households.  
  
The inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the HICP is a multi-year
project, the bank said.  
  
The ECB Governing Council committed to an ambitious climate-related
action plan and the bank will strive to systematically reflect
environmental sustainability considerations in its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

The bank said it will expand its analytical capacity in macroeconomic
modeling, statistics and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) with regard to climate change.  
  
The ECB plans to include climate change considerations in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) operations in the areas of disclosure, risk assessment,
collateral framework and corporate sector asset purchases.

Policymakers also decided to implement the action plan in line with
progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of
environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting.
