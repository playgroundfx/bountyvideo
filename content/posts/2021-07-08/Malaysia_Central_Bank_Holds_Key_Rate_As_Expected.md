Malaysia's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged on
Thursday despite significant downside risks to economic growth outlook.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to
maintain the Overnight Policy Rate at 1.75 percent.

The [economy][1] performed better-than-expected in the first quarter of
2021. The re-imposition of nationwide containment measures will curb
virus infections cases but will dampen the growth momentum, the bank
said.

Going forward, the gradual relaxation of containment measures, alongside
the rapid progress of the domestic vaccination programme and continued
strength in external demand will provide support for the growth recovery
into 2022, the bank said.

Nonetheless, the growth outlook remains subject to significant downside
risks.  
  
The increase in inflation is forecast to be transitory and headline
inflation is projected to moderate in the near term as this base effect
dissipates.

Core inflation is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5
percent and 1.5 percent for the year, amid continued spare capacity in
the economy.

Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will continue to be determined by new data and information and
their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic
growth.

The decision to hold the interest rate despite the poor economic outlook
means any further loosening is unlikely, Alex Holmes, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

But with the recovery set to be slow and fitful, the BNM will leave
interest rates at their current low until at least the end of 2022, the
economist added.
