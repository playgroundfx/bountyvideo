The European Central Bank said on Thursday it will aim for a symmetric 2
percent inflation target and will allow a temporary overshoot.  
  
"This target is symmetric, meaning negative and positive deviations of
inflation from the target are equally undesirable," the bank said in its
latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) strategy review statement.  
  
That said, when the [economy][1] is operating close to the lower bound
on nominal interest rates, it requires especially forceful or persistent
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action to avoid negative deviations from the inflation
target becoming entrenched, the bank said.

"This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is
moderately above target," the ECB added.

The new inflation target is the outcome of a strategy review that the
ECB launched in January 2020, the first such exercise since 2003.  
  
The central bank's earlier targeted Eurozone inflation "below, but close
to 2 percent."
