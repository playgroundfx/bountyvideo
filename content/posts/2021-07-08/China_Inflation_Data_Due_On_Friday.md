China is on Friday scheduled to release June figures for consumer and
producer prices, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

Inflation is called flat on month after slipping 0.2 percent in May;
it's expected to rise 1.3 percent on year - steady from the previous
reading. Producer prices are seen higher by an annual 8.8 percent,
slowing from 9.0 percent in the previous month.

The Philippines will release May trade data; in April, imports
skyrocketed 140.9 percent on year and exports surged an annual 72.1
percent for a trade deficit of $2.734 billion.
