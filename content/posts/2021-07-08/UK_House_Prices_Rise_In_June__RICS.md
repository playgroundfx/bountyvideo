UK house prices increased in June driven by the sheer lack of supply on
the market, monthly report from the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, or RICS, showed on Thursday.

The net house price balance rose to 83 percent in June from 82 percent
in May. All parts of the country continued to exhibit strong house price
inflation, led by exceptionally robust upward pressure in Yorkshire &
the Humber, Northern Ireland and Wales.

A net 56 percent of survey participants expect prices to increase
further over the next twelve months.

The RICS noted that there is a clear excess of demand over supply. The
net balance for new instructions came in at -34 percent, down from -24
percent previously.

Further, a net balance of +14 percent reported an increase in new buyer
enquiries in June. Although this is the fourth successive positive
monthly reading, it does represent a noticeable moderation compared to
the recent high of +43 percent posted back in April.

The number of agreed sales picked up once again in June, evidenced by a
net balance of +8 percent of respondents noting an increase.

Looking ahead, near term sales expectations suggested a broadly flat
outlook in the three months ahead, with the latest net balance slipping
to -4 percent from +8 percent.
