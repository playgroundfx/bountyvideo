A measure of the public assessment of the Japanese [economy][1]
increased in June, survey data from the Cabinet Office showed on
Thursday.

The current conditions index of the Economy Watchers' Survey, which
measures the current situation of the economy, increased to 47.6 in June
from 38.1 in May. In April, the reading was 39.1.

However, a reading below 50 suggests pessimism.

The outlook index that signals future activity rose to 52.4 in June from
47.6 in the previous month. In April, the reading was 41.7.
