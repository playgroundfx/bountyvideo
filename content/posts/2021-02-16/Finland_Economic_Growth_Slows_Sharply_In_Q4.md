Finland's economic expansion slowed drastically in the fourth quarter of
2020, preliminary estimates from Statistics Finland showed Tuesday, amid
a resurgence in the [coronavirus][1] infections across Europe.

Gross domestic product grew 0.2 percent from the third quarter, when the
[economy][2] expanded 3.3 percent.

The economy grew for a second consecutive quarter after a massive 3.9
percent output decline in the second quarter and a 1.5 percent fall in
the first three months of the year.

On a year-on-year basis, GDP fell a working day adjusted 2.0 percent in
the final three months of the year following a 2.7 percent slump in the
third quarter. The annual decline was 6.2 percent in the second quarter
and 1.5 percent in the three months to March.

The number of employed decreased by around 1.5 percent from a year ago.

GDP decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent month-on-month in
December following a 0.9 percent increase in the previous month.

Compared to the same month a year ago, output fell a working day
adjusted 1.8 percent after a revised 0.8 percent drop in November. The
output has been falling since February.

Primary production that includes agriculture grew around 6 percent
annually in December. Secondary output, including industry and
construction, decreased about 1.0 percent and services output shrank
around 2.0 percent.  
  
The statistical office is set to publish detailed data for the fourth
quarter and full year 2020 on February 26.
