New York manufacturing activity grew at its fastest pace in months in
February, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York on Tuesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index jumped
to 12.1 in February from 3.5 in January, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to rise to 6.0.

With the much bigger than expected increase, the general business
conditions index reached its highest level since hitting 17.0 last
September.
