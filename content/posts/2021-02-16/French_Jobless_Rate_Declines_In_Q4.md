The French jobless rate declined in the fourth quarter as the number of
people activity searching for job decreased amid fresh restrictions
imposed to curb the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, data published by the
statistical office Insee revealed Tuesday.

The ILO jobless rate fell to 8 percent in the fourth quarter from 9.1
percent in the third quarter. The rate was forecast to drop marginally
to 9 percent.

At the same time, the unemployment rate in Metropolitan France came in
at 7.7 percent, down from 8.9 percent a quarter ago.

The decrease in unemployment was primarily due to the increase in the
employment rate, which recovered again on average over the quarter, the
Insee said.

"The fall in unemployment was also partly a "trompe-l'oeil" fall: due to
the second confinement, between October 30 and December 15, a
significant number of people switched to inactivity (halo around
unemployment or inactivity outside the halo), not being able to make
active job search under the usual conditions," the statistical office
said.

The unemployment rate among youth aged between 15 and 24 declined to
18.4 percent from 22.0 percent a quarter ago.

The employment rate rose by 0.6 points to 65.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, after a similar increase in the third quarter.
