The Netherlands' [economy][1] shrank modestly in the fourth quarter of
2020, led by a decline in household consumption, defying expectations
for an expansion.

Gross domestic product decreased 0.1 percent from the previous quarter,
when the economy expanded a revised 7.8 percent, preliminary figures
from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday. Economists had
forecast 0.2 percent growth.

impact of the [coronavirus][2] pandemic and subsequent lockdown
restricitons.  
  
Household spending decreased 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter and
government consumption dropped 0.1 percent. Exports increased 1.0
percent and imports grew 1.1 percent. Investments rose 1.8 percent.  
  
Declines in the trade, transport and hotel and catering industry were
the leading contributors to the contraction of GDP. Business services,
industry and the information and communication sector made a positive
contribution to GDP.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, GDP fell for the fourth consecutive quarter,
down 2.9 percent after a 2.5 percent fall in the previous three months.
Economists had forecast a 2.4 percent fall.  
  
In the year 2020, the economy shrank a record 3.8 percent, the first
decline since 2013 and the worst fall since the 3.7 percent contraction
in 2009 amid the global financial crisis. In 2019, the economy grew 1.7
percent.  
  
Consumer spending decreased a record 6.6 percent as catering, recreation
and culture, transport and clothing sectors were shut for several months
due to the coronavirus pandemic.
