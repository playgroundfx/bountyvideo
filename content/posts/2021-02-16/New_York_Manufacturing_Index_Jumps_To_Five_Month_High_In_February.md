New York manufacturing activity grew at its fastest pace in months in
February, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York on Tuesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index jumped
to 12.1 in February from 3.5 in January, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to rise to 6.0.

With the much bigger than expected increase, the general business
conditions index reached its highest level since hitting 17.0 last
September.

The surge by the headline index was partly due to an acceleration in the
pace of new orders growth, as the new orders index climbed to 10.8 in
February from 6.6 in January.

The number of employees index also inched up to 12.1 in February from
11.2 in January, indicating a slightly faster rate of job growth.

The report also said the prices paid index surged up to 57.8 in February
from 45.5 in January, while the prices received index climbed to 23.4
from 15.2.

On the other hand, the shipments index slid to 4.0 in February from 7.3
in January, pointing to a slowdown in the pace of growth.

The New York Fed said the index for future business conditions rose to
34.9 in February from 31.9 in January, suggesting firms remain
optimistic about future conditions.

"Manufacturing's near-term prospects are fairly bright, with solid goods
demand, pandemic fiscal relief from the American Rescue Plan, and
inventory restocking all set to keep activity growing at a healthy
clip," Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Looking farther ahead, factory gears will grind at a slower
speed heading into the summer months as vaccine diffusion and improving
[health][2] conditions tilt the recovery in favor of hard-hit services,
though manufacturing will stay well supported overall in 2021."

On Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is scheduled to release
its report on regional manufacturing activity in the month of February.
The Philly Fed Index is expected to dip to 20.0 in February from 26.5 in
January.
