India's consumer prices increased more than expected in June largely
driven by higher food prices, data from the National Statistical Office
revealed Monday.

Consumer prices climbed 6.09 percent year-on-year in June, which was
above economists' forecast of 5.3 percent.

The government did not release the headline consumer price inflation
data for April and May due to insufficient data during the nationwide
lockdown. In March, inflation was 5.9 percent.

The central bank aims to keep headline consumer price inflation at 4
percent within a band of +/- 2 percent.

Food price inflation slowed to 7.87 percent in June from 9.2 percent in
May.

Data showed that clothing and footwear prices increased 3.53 percent and
housing cost advanced 3.55 percent. Fuel and light cost moved up 2.69
percent annually.
