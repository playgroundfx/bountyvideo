Germany's [economy][1] began to recover after easing of coronavirus
containment measures, the Economy Ministry said Monday.

The economy has passed the trough. However, the ministry said the
recovery process is just beginning and the capacities are still
underutilized.

According to ministry, industrial production has bottomed out.
Production is expected to pick up in months ahead on increased order
intake. Nonetheless, weak demand from non European economies remains a
risk for the further recovery.

Further, the government noted that leading indicators recovered somewhat
but a lasting improvement is not expected in the coming months.
