Ireland's construction sector expanded for the first time in four months
in June, data from the IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.9 in
June from 19.9 in May. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the
sector.

"Mirroring the pattern of the headline PMI, all three sectoral sub-
indices recorded sharp gains last month," Simon Barry, chief economist
Republic of Ireland at Ulster Bank, said.

"Overall, the June PMI is an encouraging sign that the construction
sector is now more clearly in recovery mode following the easing of
restrictions which took hold during May," Barry said.

All three categories of activity increased in June. Housing activity and
commercial activity expanded sharply, while civil engineering activity
contracted at a softer pace.

New [business][1] declined for the fourth month in a row in June due to
Covid-19 pandemic. Employment level declined sharply, albeit at a
reduced rate.

Input buying expanded in June as the projects restarted and purchasing
activity showed stabilization.

Input costs increased sharply in June, with the rate of inflation rising
from May.

Confidence among the firms about the next 12 months continued to rise
and firms reported a positive year ahead outlook for the first time in
four months.
