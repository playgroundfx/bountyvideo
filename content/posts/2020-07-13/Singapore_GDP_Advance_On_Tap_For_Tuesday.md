Singapore will on Tuesday see an advance estimate for Q2 gross domestic
product, headlining a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

GDP is expected to plummet 37.4 percent on quarter and 10.5 percent on
year after slipping 4.7 percent on quarter and 0.7 percent on year in
the previous three months.

China will release June figures for imports, exports and trade balance.
Imports are expected to sink 10.0 percent on year after losing 16.7
percent in May. Exports are called lower by an annual 1.5 percent after
sliding 3.3 percent in the previous month. The trade balance is tipped
to show a surplus of $58.6 billion, down from $62.39 billion a month
earlier.

Japan will provide final May numbers for industrial production, with
forecasts suggesting a decline of 8.4 percent on month and 25.9 percent
on year following the 9.8 percent monthly fall and the 15.0 percent
yearly drop in the previous reading.
