The manufacturing in Taiwan climbed up into expansion territory in July,
the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 50.6.

That's up from 46.2 in June, and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, operating conditions improved slightly. Output stabilized
and new [business][1] returned to growth, but employment continued to
decline.

The rate of job shedding quickened since June and was modest overall. A
number of firms commented on relatively subdued sales and efforts to
raise efficiency.
