The manufacturing sector in Malaysia was roughly flat in July, the
latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 50.0.

That's down from 51.0 in June and it now sits right on the line that
separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output rose for the second straight month, while firms
remained optimistic about their 12-month outlook.

Input prices rose at their fastest pace since October 2018.

A lack of pressure on capacity, and efforts to limit input costs, led to
further caution among manufacturers when making hiring decisions.
Employment was consequently scaled back for the fourth month running.
