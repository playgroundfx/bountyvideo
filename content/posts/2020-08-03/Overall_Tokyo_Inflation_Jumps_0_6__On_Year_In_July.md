Overall consumer prices in the Tokyo region were up 0.6 percent on year
in July, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Tuesday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.4 percent and was up
from 0.3 percent in June.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, advanced an annual 0.4
percent - again exceeding expectations for 0.2 percent, which would have
been unchanged.

Individually, prices were up for food, housing furniture, clothing,
medical care, communication and recreation. Prices were down for fuel
and education.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall inflation and core CPI
both added 0.3 percent.
