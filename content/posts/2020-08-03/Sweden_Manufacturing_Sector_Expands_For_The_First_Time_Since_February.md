Sweden's manufacturing sector expanded for the first time in five months
in July, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF
showed on Monday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector increased to
51.0 in July from a revised 47.6 in June. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

"The July outcome shows that the [economy][1] in the Swedish
manufacturing industry continues to recover at a rapid pace after the
deep decline this spring," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

The sub-index for order intake and production increased in July.
Employment in manufacturing declined further and delivery time
lengthened.

Production plans for the next six months remained unchanged in July and
indicated a weaker price pressure.

"Whether it is temporary or if the companies have become more careful in
their production plans remains to be seen in the coming months,"
Kennemar said.
