The euro area manufacturing sector returned to growth in July for the
first time in a year-and-a-half as output and demand continued to
recover with the further easing of restrictions related to the
[coronavirus][1] disease, final data from IHS Markit showed Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.8 in July from
47.4 in June. This was also above the flash reading of 51.1.

Both production and new orders returned to growth in July. The marked
expansion in output was registered for the first time since the start of
2019 and the growth in new orders was the strongest since early 2018.

Nonetheless, firms continued to operate below capacity and employment
decreased for the fifteenth straight month.

On the price front, the survey showed that input prices remained inside
deflationary territory. Due to competitive pressures and weak demand led
to another cut in output charges.

Finally, looking ahead to the coming 12 months, [business][2] confidence
continued to recover in July, rising since June to its highest level
since January.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the next
few months numbers will be all important in assessing whether the recent
uplift in demand can be sustained, helping firms recover lost production
and alleviating some of the need for further cost cutting going forward.

At the country level, only Greece and the Netherlands registered PMI
readings below 50.0 as the majority returned to growth in July.

Spain was the strongest-performing nation. France reported solid gain,
while Germany and Italy reported moderate expansion.

Spain's factory PMI came in at 53.5 versus 49.0 in June and the expected
score of 52.0. Orders, purchasing and production all reported to be up,
with demand higher in both domestic and international [markets][3].

As firms continued to ramp up their operations after coronavirus-induced
shutdowns, France's final manufacturing PMI rose to 52.4 in July from
52.3 in June. The flash reading was 52.0. The improvement was driven by
a marked expansion in output, which came despite a lack of new order
growth.

Driven by a steep rebound in new orders, Germany's headline IHS
Markit/BME final manufacturing PMI rose to 51.0 in July from 45.2 in
June. Production was ramped up but employment continued to fall sharply.
The sector expanded for the first time since December 2018.

Italy's manufacturing sector logged its strongest growth since June
2018. The PMI advanced more-than-expected to 51.9 from 47.5 in June. The
expected reading was 51.2.
