Italy's manufacturing sector grew for the first time in nearly two years
in July, survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to 51.9 in July
from 47.5 in June. This was the highest reading since June 2018 and
above economists' forecast of 51.2.  
  
Output rose for the second month in a row amid the first increase in
order book volumes since July 2018.

Easing lockdown measures and subsequent improvements in demand
conditions were linked by panelists to the rises in both production and
new [business][1].

However, employment declined for the fourteenth successive month in
July.  
  
On the prices front, the survey showed that cost burdens rose for the
first time since January amid reports of greater raw material costs.
Firms kept up discounting efforts in July with average charges falling
for the sixth month running and moderately.

Finally, firms remained optimistic with regards to output over the year
ahead.
