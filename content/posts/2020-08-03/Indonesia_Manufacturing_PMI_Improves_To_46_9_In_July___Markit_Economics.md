The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to contract in July,
albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Monday with a six-month high manufacturing PMI score of 46.9.

That's up from 39.1 in June, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production and new orders declined at much slower rates,
while [business][1] optimism remained elevated.

Gradual steps to restart the Indonesian [economy][2] also led to a much
softer fall in overall demand. The downturn in total new orders was only
marginal in July despite a substantial fall in export sales.
