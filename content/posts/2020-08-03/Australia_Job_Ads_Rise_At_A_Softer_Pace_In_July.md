Australia's job advertisement increased at a softer pace in July, data
from ANZ showed Monday.

Job ads increased 16.7 percent month-on-month in July, following a 41.4
percent rise in June.

However, job advertisements decreased by 34 percent annually in July.
Job ads remained below 30 percent since February.

"The second wave of COVID-19 cases and return to Stage 3 restrictions in
Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire have undoubtedly weighed on the
recovery in labor demand so far," ANZ Senior Economist Catherine Birch
said.

"Payroll jobs turned down in early July and some industries that were
less affected earlier in the pandemic, such as construction and
professional services, may now be suffering lagged impacts," Birch
added.
