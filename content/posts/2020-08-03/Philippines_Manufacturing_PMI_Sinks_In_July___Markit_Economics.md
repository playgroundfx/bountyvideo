The manufacturing sector in the Philippines continued to contract in
July, and at a sharper rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics
showed on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 48.4.

That's down from 49.7 in June, and it moves further beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, [business][1] conditions worsened as manufacturers saw a
decline in production.

New orders decreased modestly amid a much sharper drop in exports.
Employment declined at its sharpest pace in four months.
