The manufacturing sector in Vietnam slipped back into contraction in
July, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 47.6.

That's down from 51.1 in June, and it falls back beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders fell after having risen in June.
There was further reduction in employment, although firms remained
optimistic about future output.

With new orders taking a step back, firms were able to deplete their
backlogs of work again in July. Outstanding [business][1] decreased for
the sixth month running, and to a greater extent than in the prior
survey period.
