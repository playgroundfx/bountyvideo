Spain's manufacturing sector rebounded at the fastest rate since 2018 as
businesses continued to reopen following the lockdown, survey data from
IHS Markit showed Monday.  
  
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose more-than-expected to
53.5 in July from 49.0 in June. This was the highest reading since April
2018 and the expected score was 52.0.

There were concurrent returns to growth in both output and new orders.
Manufacturers also raised their purchasing activity. Despite the
upswings in production and order books, firms continued to operate well
below capacity.  
  
Employment declined for a fifteenth successive month, with several
companies expecting to experience excess capacity for the foreseeable
future.

Confidence about the future also remained subdued in July.

Manufacturing input costs continued to fall in July. However, overall
degree of deflation was the softest in nearly a year. Due to
competition, manufacturers reduced their output charges for the eleventh
successive month.
