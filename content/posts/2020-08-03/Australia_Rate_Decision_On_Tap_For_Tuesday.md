The Reserve Bank of Australia will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
and then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a modest
day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

The RBA is widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate at the
record low of 0.25 percent.

Australia will also release June figures for imports, exports, trade
balance and retail sales. In May, imports were down 6.0 percent on
month, while exports fell 4.0 percent for a trade surplus of A$8.025
billion. Retail sales are expected to rise 2.4 percent on month after
spiking 16.9 percent in May.

South Korea will see July numbers for consumer prices, with forecasts
calling for an increase of 0.1 percent on month and 0.35 percent on
year. That follows the 0.2 percent monthly increase and the flat annual
reading in June.

Japan will provide July numbers for Tokyo-area consumer prices, which
are considered a leading indicator for the nationwide trend. In June,
Tokyo overall inflation gained 0.3 percent on year and core CPI rose 0.2
percent.
