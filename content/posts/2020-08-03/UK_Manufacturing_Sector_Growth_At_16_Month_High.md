The UK manufacturing sector expanded the most in more than a year in
July as output growth hit a 32-month high due to further loosening of
the lockdown conditions in place due to the [coronavirus][1] disease,
final data from IHS Markit showed Monday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply final
manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a 16-month high of 53.3
in July from 50.1 in June. However, this was below the flash estimate of
53.6.

Respondents noted that manufacturers either restarted or raised
production in response to clients reopening. Although this is a positive
start, it will take several months of growth to fully recoup the output
lost since the start of the pandemic.

Production was raised to the greatest extent since November 2017. Driven
by domestic demand, new orders expanded for the first time since
February. Meanwhile, export [business][2] fell for the ninth straight
month.

The survey showed that sentiment among manufacturers reached its highest
since March 2018.

Employment fell for the sixth consecutive month in July, albeit to the
least marked extent since March. Purchasing activity was raised for the
first time since last October.

Average input prices rose for the eighth month in a row, and at the
fastest pace in over a year. The pass-through of higher costs resulted
in a further rise in output charges.

"Despite the solid start to the recovery, the road left to travel
remains long and precarious," Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said.

There is a significant risk of further redundancies and of furloughed
workers not returning unless demand and confidence stage more
substantial and long-lasting rebounds in the months ahead, Dobson added.
