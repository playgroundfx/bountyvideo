The manufacturing sector in Thailand continued to contract in July,
albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 45.9.

That's up from 43.5 in June, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders both fell at slower but still sharp
rates. Export sales fell severely and [business][1] expectations
remained deeply pessimistic.

With the downturn extending into the third quarter, manufacturing
employment continued to fall during July amid an ongoing rise in spare
capacity.
