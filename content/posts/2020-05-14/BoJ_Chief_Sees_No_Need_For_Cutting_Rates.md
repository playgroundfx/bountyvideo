Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday that there is no
need to cut rates deep into negative zone.

In a seminar, Kuroda said there is no change in the bank's stance of
aiming 2 percent inflation target, although it is likely to take an
extended period of time to achieve it. Due to the global spread of
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, inflation is expected to be weak on lower
oil prices.

It is extremely important in the current phase to maintain accommodative
financial conditions, he said.

Kuroda added that the top-priority is to protect employment, businesses
and people's livelihoods until the spread of Covid-19 is contained.

The central bank is determined to do whatever it takes to ensure smooth
financing and maintain stability in the financial [markets][2], said
Kuroda.
