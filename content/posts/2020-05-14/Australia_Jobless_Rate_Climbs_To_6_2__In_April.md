The unemployment rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 6.2
percent in April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.
That was up from 5.2 percent in March but was well beneath expectations
for 8.3 percent.

The Australian [economy][1] lost 594,300 jobs last month - missing
forecasts for a decline of 575,000 following the increase of 5,900 jobs
in the previous month.

The participation rate was 63.5 percent in April, well shy of
expectations for 65.2 percent and down from 66.0 percent a month
earlier.
