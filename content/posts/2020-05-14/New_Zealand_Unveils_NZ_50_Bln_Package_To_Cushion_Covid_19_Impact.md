The New Zealand government announced an unprecedented economic package
on Thursday to cushion the blow of [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19,
pandemic.

In the Budget 2020, Finance Minister Grant Robertson on Thursday,
unveiled a NZ$50 billion 'COVID Response and Recovery Fund' which will
invest in wage subsidy extension, free training and apprenticeships,
house build programme, infrastructure development, and support for
exporters and SMEs.

"This is the most significant financial commitment by a New Zealand
government in modern [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)," Robertson said.

Of the total NZ$50 billion, investments totaling NZ$13.9 billion have
already been made from the fund and NZ$15.9 billion is set aside to
continue with the immediate response, leaving NZ$20.2 billion for future
investment.

These investments will be funded through long-term borrowing. The
government debt is forecast to peak at 53.6 percent in 2023 and 2024.

New Zealand's real growth rate was forecast to decline to -4.6 percent
in the year ending June 2020, driven by a quarterly decline in GDP of
over 20 percent in the June 2020 quarter.

Annual average GDP growth is projected to return to positive from the
year ending September 2021 onwards.

The unemployment is expected to increase significantly, rising to 8.3
percent in the year ending June 2020, before peaking at 9.8 percent in
September 2020, and then recovering thereafter.

Operating deficits will average 9.3 percent of GDP between 2020 and
2022. Careful economic management will see the deficit reduce to 1.3
percent of GDP by 2024, Robertson said.
