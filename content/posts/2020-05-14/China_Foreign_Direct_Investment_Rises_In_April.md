Foreign direct investment to mainland China grew in April, as the
country attempts to recover from the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19,
pandemic, official data showed on Thursday.  
  
Foreign direct investment rose 8.6 percent year-on-year in U.S. dollar
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) in April, the state-run [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) agency Xinhua reported citing data
from the Ministry of Commerce.

Foreign investment totaled $10.14 billion during the month.

In yuan [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), FDI increased 11.8 percent year-on-year to CNY 70.36
billion.  
  
However, foreign investment decreased by 8.4 percent year-on-year in the
January to April period to $41.34 billion, due to the Covid-19 impact.
