Spain's consumer price inflation slowed as initially estimated to the
lowest since mid-2016, final data from the statistical office INE showed
Thursday.

Consumer prices fell 0.7 percent on a yearly basis in April, as
estimated, after staying flat a month ago. This was the biggest fall
since June 2016, when prices were down 0.8 percent.

At the same time, core inflation held steady at 1.1 percent.

Meanwhile, month-on-month, consumer prices gained 0.3 percent, in
contrast to a 0.4 percent drop in March. The rate came in line with the
estimate published on April 30.  
  
The annual fall was largely driven by a 6.8 percent decrease in
transportation and 6.6 percent fall in housing costs. Meanwhile, food
and non-alcoholic beverages prices advanced 4 percent.

Inflation, based on the harmonized index of consumer prices declined 0.7
percent, reversing a 0.1 percent rise in March. The annual rate was
revised from 0.6 percent. A similar faster drop was last seen in July
2016.

On a monthly basis, HICP inflation eased to 0.4 percent from 0.6
percent. The monthly rate matched preliminary estimate.
