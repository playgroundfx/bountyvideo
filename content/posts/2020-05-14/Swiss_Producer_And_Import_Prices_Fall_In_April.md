Switzerland's producer and import prices declined in April mainly due to
lower prices for petroleum products, the Federal Statistical Office
reported Thursday.

Producer and import prices fell 4 percent in April from the same period
last year.

The producer price index slid 2 percent, while import prices logged a
sharper drop of 7.8 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer and import prices declined 1.3 percent in
April. Producer prices were down 0.6 percent and import prices decreased
2.9 percent.

The 2.9 percent decrease in import prices was driven by petroleum and
natural gas prices, machinery, electrical equipment, metal products and
pharma.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said the unemployment
rate declined to 4.5 percent in the first quarter from 4.9 percent in
the same period last year.

At the same time, the number of employed grew 1.1 percent in the first
quarter.

These indicators reflect the averages for the quarter and are only
marginally affected by the Covid-19 crisis, the statistical office said.
