UK retailers expect sales to fall at the start of the year after broadly
stabilizing in December, the latest monthly Distributive Trades Survey
data from the Confederation of British Industry showed Monday.

The retail sales balance fell to -3 percent in December from -25 percent
in November. However, a net 33 percent expects sales to fall in the year
to January.

The survey which was in field between November 23 and December 14,
covering the latter part of the second English lockdown and the return
to tiered restrictions, revealed significant divergence across sub-
sectors.

While grocers, furniture vendors and retailers of 'other normal goods'
logged strong growth, clothing, footwear and department stores continued
to report volumes were lower than a year earlier.

Ben Jones, principal economist at the CBI, said "It says something about
the challenges the retail sector has faced during 2020 that stable sales
volumes in the run-up to Christmas were seen as a good result for the
time of year."

"The new year looks set for an unpromising start, with retailers
anticipating a sharp fall in sales in January," Jones added. "An
expected deterioration in the labour market will likely weigh on
household spending, even assuming the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines
paves the way for a gradual lifting of restrictions as the year
progresses."
