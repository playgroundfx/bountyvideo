The private sector in Hong Kong continued to expand in August, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Friday
with a PMI score of 53.3.

That's up from 51.3 in July, and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Hong Kong SAR's private sector expanded at the fastest pace in seven-
and-a-half years, reflecting better economic conditions amid the
stabilization of COVID-19 conditions. Business confidence improved
alongside higher demand and [business][1] activity in August. That said,
COVID-19 disruptions to supply chains sustained, leading to the
lengthening of delivery times and higher prices in August.

Output and new orders both increased for the fifth straight month and at
rates which were each multi-year highs. Panelists commonly associated
the pickup in business activity with better economic activity amid low
COVID-19 infections, in addition to the boost from the distribution of
consumption vouchers.
