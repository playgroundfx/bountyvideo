Russia's service sector contracted for the first time this year in
August amid weaker demand and [business][1] confidence, data from IHS
Markit showed on Friday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.3 in August from 53.5
in July.

This was the first decline since December last year. Any reading below
50 indicates contraction in the sector.

New business eased in August though new export orders expanded.

The rate of cost inflation eased to the lowest in seven months and
selling prices softened.

Employment dropped for the first time since January and backlogs of work
declined.

Business expectations worsened in August, with the degree of confidence
sliding to its weakest level since November last year.

The composite output index fell to 48.2 in August from 51.7 in July.

"Our current forecast expects a further hike in interest rates as
consumer price inflation remains above target," Sian Jones, senior
economist at IHS Markit, said.
