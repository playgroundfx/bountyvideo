U.S. job growth fell well short of economic estimates in the month of
August, according to a closely watched report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 235,000
jobs in August after soaring by an upwardly revised 1.053 million jobs
in July.

Economists had expected employment to jump by about 750,000 jobs
compared to the spike of 943,000 jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

Despite the much weaker than expected job growth, the unemployment rate
fell to 5.2 percent in August from 5.4 percent in July, matching
economist estimates.
