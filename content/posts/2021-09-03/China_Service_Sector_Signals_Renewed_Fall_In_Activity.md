China's service sector signaled a renewed fall in [business][1] activity
in August as rising coronavirus infection at home and abroad weighed on
operations and demand, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 46.7 in August
from 54.9 in July. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the
sector.

According to official survey, released earlier this week, the non-
manufacturing PMI, which measures the performance of the services and
construction sectors, declined to 47.5 in August from 53.3 a month ago.

Total new orders received by services companies fell for the first time
in 16 months in August, IHS Markit said. Service providers signaled a
slight reduction in employment for the second time in the past three
months.

Lower staffing levels and pandemic-related disruption led to a second
successive monthly rise in the amount of outstanding business.

Input prices rose moderately, which was largely linked to higher
staffing costs and increased transport fees. Meanwhile, output prices
fell, following a solid increase in the previous month.  
  
Services companies in China remained upbeat towards the year-ahead
outlook in August, as firms generally anticipated activity would
increase.

The composite output index posted 47.2 in August, down from 53.1 in
July, to signal a renewed fall in overall business activity across
China. Although moderate, it marked the first decline in output since
April 2020, the survey showed.

"Official economic indicators for July were worse than the market
expected, indicating mounting downward pressure on economic growth,"
Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group said.

Authorities need to take a holistic view and balance the goals of
containing Covid-19, stabilizing the job market, and maintaining
stability in prices and supply, Wang added.
