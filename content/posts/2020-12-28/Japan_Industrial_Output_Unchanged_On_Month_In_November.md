Industrial output in Japan was flat on a seasonally adjusted basis in
November, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on Monday.

That missed expectations for an increase of 1.2 percent following the
4.0 percent gain in October.

On a yearly basis, industrial production sank 3.4 percent, matching
forecasts following the 3.0 percent drop in the previous month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI maintained its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it is picking up.

Industries that increased included production machinery,
[business][1]-oriented machinery and iron and steel. These were offset
by declines among motor vehicles, chemicals and plastic products.

Shipments were down 0.9 percent on month and 3.9 percent on year, while
inventories fell 1.1 percent on month and 8.7 percent on year. The
inventory ratio slipped 1.8 percent on month and 1.2 percent on year.

Industries that contributed to the decline in shipments included motor
vehicles, electrical machinery and petroleum products. These were
mitigated by gains among production machinery, business oriented
machinery and electronic parts and devices.

Industries that contributed to the decline in inventories included
chemicals and production machinery. These were offset by gains among
iron and steel, paper and plastic products.

According to the METI's forecast of industrial production, output is
expected to sink 1.1 percent in December and then spike 7.1 percent in
January.

Industries contributing to the loss in December include transport
equipment, business oriented machinery and electrical machinery.

Industries contributing to the gain in January include production
machinery, business oriented machinery and electronic parts.
