Industrial production in Japan was unchanged on a seasonally adjusted
basis in November, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on
Monday.

That missed expectations for an increase of 1.2 percent following the
4.0 percent gain in October.

On a yearly basis, industrial production sank 3.4 percent, matching
forecasts following the 3.0 percent drop in the previous month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI maintained its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it is picking up.
