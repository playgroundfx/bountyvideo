Dutch producer confidence improved in December to its highest level
since March, data from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed on
Monday.

The producer sentiment index rose to a nine-month high of -0.4 in
December from -3.8 in November. This was below the average score of 0.3
seen over the past twenty years.

Opinion on expected activity improved in December. Producers were less
negative about the order book for the seventh straight month, and their
assessment of stocks of finished products was more positive, the agency
said.

There were more entrepreneurs who expected their production to increase
in the coming three months, the agency said.

Producers were more positive in the wood and building materials
industry, while sentiment in food industry was more negative.
