Hong Kong's merchandise exports grew in November after falling in the
previous month, data from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Monday.

Exports rose 5.6 percent year-on-year in November, after a 1.1 percent
decrease in October.

Imports gained 5.1 percent annually in November, following a 0.6 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit widened to HK$25.609 billion in November from
HK$26.168 billion in the same month last year. In October, the deficit
was HK$36.756 billion.

For the January to November period, exports decreased 2.8 percent year-
on-year and imports fell 5.0 percent. The trade deficit was HK$296.603
billion.

"Looking ahead, while the continued strengthening of the Mainland
[economy][1] should render support to Hong Kong's exports, the sharp
deterioration of epidemic situations in many advanced economies of late
may slow the pace of global economic recovery in the coming months and
constrain Hong Kong's export performance," the government spokesman
said.
