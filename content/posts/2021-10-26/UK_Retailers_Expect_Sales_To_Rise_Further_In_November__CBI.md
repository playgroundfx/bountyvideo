UK retailers expect sales to be above seasonal norms in November, the
Distributive Trades Survey results from the Confederation of British
Industry revealed on Tuesday.

The retail sales balance rose to 30 percent in October from 11 percent
in September. A net 35 percent forecast sales to increase further next
month.

A net 48 percent of retailers reported order growth in October versus 20
percent in September. However, a net 41 percent expects orders to ease
slightly next month.

However, this pick-up may partly reflect a comparison with October 2020,
when sales and orders both declined amid rising Covid-19 cases and a
tightening of social restrictions.

"The UK's economic recovery has been pretty bumpy lately and the same
seems true of the retail sector," Ben Jones, CBI principal economist,
said. Sales performance has jumped around in recent months, while stock
shortages continue to bite.

"Disruption to supply chains, combined with staff shortages and
uncertain public [health][1] conditions mean retailers are finding it
difficult to plan for the winter ahead," Jones added.
