Eurozone banks plan to tighten their conditions for housing loans
further in the fourth quarter, the Bank Lending Survey from the European
Central Bank showed on Tuesday.

In the fourth quarter, banks plan to tighten credit standards for loans
to firms and to ease criteria slightly for consumer credit.

Lending standards for consumer credit and other lending to households
remained broadly unchanged in the third quarter.

Banks' overall [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) and conditions agreed in loan contracts, eased
slightly for loans to firms, while they tightened for housing loans and
remained broadly unchanged for consumer credit in the third quarter.  
  
There was a slight increase in firms' demand for loans or drawing of
credit lines in the third quarter.

Driven by improved consumer confidence and the low general level of
interest rates, demand for housing loans and for consumer credit to
households increased in the third quarter. Lenders expect net demand to
increase further for loans to firms and households in the fourth
quarter.

Euro area banks' access to retail and wholesale funding continued to
improve in the third quarter. The survey was conducted among 146 banks
between September 20 and October 5.
