Singapore consumer price inflation moderated slightly in August
reflecting lower private transport price growth, data published by the
Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry
showed on Thursday.

Consumer price inflation slowed to 2.4 percent from 2.5 percent. The
rate came in line with economists' expectations.

The moderation reflected lower private transport inflation, which more
than offset the rise in core inflation. Private transport costs rose at
a slower pace of 10.8 percent, largely due to the smaller increase in
car prices and the decline in other private transport services costs.

Meanwhile, MAS core inflation edged up to 1.1 percent in August from 1.0
percent in July.

The increase in core rate was largely driven by higher food inflation
and the smaller decline in the cost of retail and other goods.

On a monthly basis, core inflation came in at 0.2 percent and overall
consumer price inflation at 0.5 percent.

MAS core inflation is projected to increase gradually in the coming
months. For 2021 as a whole, MAS core inflation is expected to average
0-1 percent, while overall inflation is forecast to come in between 1-2
percent.
