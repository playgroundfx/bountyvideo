France's private sector logged the slowest pace of growth since April as
the rates of expansion lost steam in manufacturing and services sectors
in September, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The flash composite output index dropped to a five-month low of 55.1 in
September from 56.9 in August. The reading was also below economists'
forecast of 55.8.

"The index has been trending lower since it peaked in June, and this
could easily continue as we head into the autumn and winter period
across Europe," Joe Hayes, a senior economist at IHS Markit said.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to an eight-month low
of 55.2 from 57.5 in the prior month. The score was forecast to drop
moderately to 57.0. The manufacturing output growth was curtailed by
shortages of raw materials and other key components.

At the same time, the services PMI came in at 56.0, as expected, but
down from 56.3 in August.
