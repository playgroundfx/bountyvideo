Brazil's central bank raised its key interest rates by 100 basis points
on Wednesday and signaled another hike of the same magnitude at the next
meeting to bring inflation down to the target.

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee, known as Copom, unanimously decided to
increase the Selic rate by 100 basis points to 6.25 percent from 5.25
percent.

The bank has raised its rate by a massive 425 basis points so far this
year.

Policymakers observed that, at the current stage of the tightening
cycle, this pace is the most appropriate to guarantee inflation
convergence to the target and allow the committee to gain more
information regarding the state of the [economy][1].

"For the next meeting, the Committee foresees another adjustment of the
same magnitude," the bank said in a statement.

"The Copom emphasized that its future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) steps could be adjusted to
ensure the achievement of the inflation target and will depend on the
evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on
inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," the bank said.
