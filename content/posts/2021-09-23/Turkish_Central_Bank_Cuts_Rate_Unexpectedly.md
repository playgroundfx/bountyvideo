Turkey's central bank cut its key interest rates unexpectedly on
Thursday as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed that the recent inflationary pressures
were due to transitory factors and that the tighter [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance was
hurting bank lending.  
  
The Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Sahap Kavcioglu, lowered
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate, which is the one-week repo auction rate, from 19
percent to 18 percent. Economists had expected the rate to be left
unchanged.  
  
The central bank said it will "continue to use decisively all available
instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in
inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of
the primary objective of price stability".

Policymakers decided to cut the rate despite concerns over rising
inflation. The country's President Tayyip Erdogan has been seeking lower
interest rates over the past few months.  
  
"Looking ahead, we expect inflation to fall sharply over the next six to
nine months and, against the backdrop of political pressure, that is
likely to trigger further aggressive easing," Capital Economics
economist Jason Tuvey said.  
  
The firm expects the one-week repo rate to be lowered to 12.00 percent
by the middle of next year.  
  
"But looser monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the context of an [economy][1] already
operating above its pre-virus trend risks causing imbalances to building
and sowing the seeds of another balance of payments crisis," Tuvey
added.
