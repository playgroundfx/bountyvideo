The Conference Board released a report on Thursday showing a bigger than
expected increase by its index of leading U.S. economic indicators in
the month of August.

The report said the leading economic index advanced by 0.9 percent in
August after climbing by 0.8 percent in July. Economists had expected
the index to rise by 0.6 percent.

The bigger than expected increase by the index reflected positive
contributions from eight of the ten indicators, including average weekly
initial jobless claims, the ISM New Orders Index and building permits.

"While the Delta variant—alongside rising inflation fears—could create
headwinds for labor [markets][1] and the consumer spending outlook in
the near term, the trend in the LEI is consistent with robust economic
growth in the reminder of the year," said Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior
Director of Economic Research at The Conference Board.

He added, "Real GDP growth for 2021 is expected to reach nearly 6.0
percent year-over-year, before easing to a still-robust 4.0 percent for
2022."

The report said the coincident economic index edged up by 0.2 percent in
August following a 0.6 percent increase in July.

The lagging economic index also inched up by 0.1 percent in August after
rising by 0.5 percent in the previous month.
