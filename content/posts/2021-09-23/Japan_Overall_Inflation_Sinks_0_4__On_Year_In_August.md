Overall inflation in Japan was down 0.4 percent on year in August, the
Ministry of Communications and Internal Affairs said on Friday - shy of
expectations for -0.3 percent, which would have been unchanged from the
July reading.

Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food costs, was unchanged
on year. That matched forecasts following the 0.2 percent annual decline
in the previous month.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall inflation was down 0.2
percent and core CPI eased 0.1 percent.
