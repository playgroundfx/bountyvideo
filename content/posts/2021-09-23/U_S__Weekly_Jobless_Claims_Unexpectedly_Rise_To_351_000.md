A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time
claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased for the
second straight week in the week ended September 18th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose to 351,000, an
increase of 16,000 from the previous week's revised level of 335,000.

With the uptick, jobless claims climbed further off the pandemic-era low
of 312,000 set in the week ended September 4th.

The continued rebound surprised economists, who had expected jobless
claims to dip to 320,000 from the 332,000 originally reported for the
previous month.
