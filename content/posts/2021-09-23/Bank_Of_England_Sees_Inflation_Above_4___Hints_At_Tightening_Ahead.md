The Bank of England left its key interest rate at a record low and
quantitative easing unchanged, but [markets][1] are pricing a rate hike
next year after the bank warned that inflation is set to peak above 4
percent this winter.

The Monetary Policy Committee unanimously decided to leave the key
interest rate unchanged at 0.10 percent.

The MPC also retained the existing stock of corporate bond purchases at
GBP 20 billion and the government bond purchases target at GBP 875
billion, taking the size of the total quantitative easing to GBP 895
billion.

While seven members voted to maintain the quantitative easing, Dave
Ramsden joined Michael Saunders to seek an end to the current asset
purchase programme as soon as practical rather than continuing it until
around the end of the year, as currently planned.

These two members voted to reduce the target for the stock of government
bond purchases from GBP 875 billion to GBP 840 billion.

The latest statement from the Bank of England suggested that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
tightening is nearing. The MPC noted that some "modest tightening" over
the forecast period was likely to be necessary.

The MPC is getting closer to interest rate rises, Ruth Gregory, an
economist at Capital Economics, said. As such, the first rate hike will
be sometime in 2022 rather than in 2023.

Given the number of headwinds facing the [economy][2] this winter, a
rate hike is unlikely until the second half of 2022 - later than
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are expecting, James Smith, an ING economist, said.

The announcement came after the US Federal Reserve signaled that the
tapering of asset purchases is coming soon. In the statement, the Fed
said, "a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be
warranted".

As inflation exceeded the 2 percent target by more than one percentage
point in August, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey wrote an open letter to the
Chancellor Rishi Sunak citing the reasons for higher inflation.

Bailey said inflation is expected to rise further in the near term, to
slightly above 4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year due to high
energy and goods prices.

Nonetheless, inflation was expected to fall back to close to the 2
percent target in the medium term as the current elevated global cost
pressures will prove transitory.

Citing supply constraints on output, the bank downgraded its growth
outlook for the third quarter of 2021. The level of UK GDP for the third
quarter was revised down by around 1 percent since the August Report.
