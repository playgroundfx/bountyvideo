Reflecting a sharp increase in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing new orders
for U.S. manufactured durable goods spiked by much more than expected in
the month of July.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders skyrocketed by 11.2
percent in July after surging up by a revised 7.7 percent in June.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to increase by 4.3 percent
compared to the 7.6 percent jump that had been reported for the previous
month.

Excluding the substantial increase in orders for transportation
equipment, durable goods orders rose by a much more modest 2.4 percent
in July after climbing by 4.0 percent in June. The increase still
exceeded estimates for 2.0 percent growth.
