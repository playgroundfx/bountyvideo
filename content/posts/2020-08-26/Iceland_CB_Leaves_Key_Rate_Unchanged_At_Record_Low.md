Iceland's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record
low on Wednesday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Iceland retained
its key interest rate, which is the seven-day term deposit rate at 1.00
percent.

The bank has reduced the rate four times so far this year.

According to the latest macroeconomic forecast, the [economy][1] is set
to contract 7 percent this year and unemployment to reach roughly 10
percent by the year-end.

Although the outlook for the second half of 2020 was somewhat poorer
than was forecast in May, the contraction for the year as a whole was
revised from -8 percent. The outlook was revised up mainly due to the
robust private consumption seen during the spring and summer.

According to the Bank's forecast, inflation is expected to average about
3 percent over the remainder of 2020.

The bank said lower interest rates, together with actions taken by the
central bank this spring, have supported domestic demand.  
  
The impact of these measures has yet to emerge in full, however, and
they will continue to support the economy and facilitate a more rapid
recovery than would otherwise occur, the bank added.
