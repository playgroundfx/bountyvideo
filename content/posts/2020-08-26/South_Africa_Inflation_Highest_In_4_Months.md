South Africa's consumer price inflation rose to the highest in four
months in July, figures from Statistics South Africa showed on
Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 3.2 percent year-on-year in July,
following a 2.2 percent increase in June. Economists had expected a 3.1
percent rise.

The latest inflation was the highest since March, when it was 4.1
percent.

The main contributions to the annual inflation came from food and non-
alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and
services.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 4.3 percent
annually in July and housing and utilities cost rose by 3.2 percent.

Prices of miscellaneous goods and services rose 6.7 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, the consumer price index increased 1.3
percent in June. Economists had forecast a rise of 1.2 percent.

The core inflation, which excludes prices of non-alcoholic beverages,
fuels and energy, was 3.2 percent in July. Economists had expected a 3.0
percent increase.

On a monthly basis, the core CPI rose 0.7 percent in July. Economists
had forecast a rise of 0.5 percent.
