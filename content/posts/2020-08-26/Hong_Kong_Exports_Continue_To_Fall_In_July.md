Hong Kong's merchandise exports decreased at a faster pace in July, data
from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Wednesday.

Exports fell 3.0 percent year-on-year in July, following a 1.3 percent
decrease in June. Shipments declined for the fifth consecutive month.

At the same time, imports declined 3.4 percent annually in July,
following a 7.1 percent fall in the previous month.

Consequently, the trade deficit narrowed to HK$29.82 billion in July
from HK$32.17 billion in the same month last year. In June, the deficit
was HK$33.34 billion.

For the January to July period, exports decreased 6.3 percent year-on-
year and imports fell 8.5 percent. The trade deficit was HK$205.32
billion.

"Exports to the US, the EU and many other major Asian [markets][1] fell
further on a year-on-year basis amid subdued external demand," a
government spokesman said.

"Meanwhile, exports to the Mainland sustained moderate growth alongside
the solid economic recovery there," spokesman added.

"Looking ahead, the threat of COVID-19 will remain until an effective
vaccine or treatment is widely available," spokesman said.

"The weak global [economy][2], together with the tense China-US
relations, will continue to cloud the outlook for Hong Kong's
merchandise exports in the near term," spokesman added.
