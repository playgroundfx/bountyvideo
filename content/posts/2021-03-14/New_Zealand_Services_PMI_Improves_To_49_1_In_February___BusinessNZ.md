The services sector in New Zealand continued to contract in February,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ showed on
Monday with a Performance of Services Index score of 49.1.

That's up from 48.0 in January, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Among the individual components, sales (50.8), employment (50.9) and new
orders (50.3) were in expansion territory, while inventories (45.9) and
supplier deliveries (40.8) continued to contract.

"When simply averaging across all responses to the PSI and PMI surveys
gives a composite reading of 51.6 for February," BNZ Senior Economist
Craig Ebert said. "But re-weighting for the fact services comprise
around 70 percent of the [economy][1] and the composite index yields
49.7. With this, we remain decidedly cautious on GDP growth for Q1."
