The value of core machine orders in Japan was down a seasonally adjusted
4.5 percent on month in January, the Cabinet Office said on Monday -
coming in at 841.7 billion yen.

That exceeded expectations for a decline of 5.5 percent following the
upwardly revised 5.3 percent increase in December (originally 5.2
percent).

On a yearly basis, core machine orders climbed 1.5 percent - again
beating forecasts for a decline of 0.2 percent after spiking 11.8
percent in the previous month.

The forecast for Q1 2021 core machine orders suggests a decline of 6.0
percent on quarter and 5.2 percent on year.
