Citing progress towards it goals of maximum employment and price
stability, the Federal Reserve hinted Wednesday that tapering of the
central bank's asset purchases could begin in the near future.

The Fed said in the announcement of its latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision
that a "moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted"
if progress towards its dual goals continues broadly as expected.

The central bank currently plans to continue its bond purchases at a
rate of at least $120 billion per month but is expected to begin scaling
back later this year.

During his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell
indicated the central bank could begin tapering its asset purchases as
soon as its next meeting in early November.

"While no decisions were made, participants generally viewed that so
long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that
concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate,"
Powell said.

Powell said substantial further progress has been achieved with regard
to the Fed's inflation goal, while "the test for substantial further
progress on employment is all but met."

The comments about tapering asset purchases came as the Fed announced
its widely expected decision to keep the target range for the federal
funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent.

The Fed also reiterated that it expects it will be appropriate to
maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached
levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation is on track to
moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

However, the latest projections from the Fed showed a majority of
officials now expect interest rates to be raised next year compared to
previous forecasts calling for the first rate hike in 2023.

Fed officials also downwardly revised forecasts for U.S. GDP growth in
2021 to 5.9 percent from 7.0 percent, while forecasts for GDP growth in
2022 were upwardly revised to 3.8 percent from 3.3 percent.

Core consumer price inflation is expected to reach 3.7 percent this year
compared to the 3.0 percent forecast in June. Price growth is expected
to pullback to 2.3 percent in 2022, which is still above the Fed's 2
percent target.

In the statement, the Fed described inflation as "elevated" but
continued to attribute the price growth to "transitory factors."
