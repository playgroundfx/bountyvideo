The Bank of Japan kept its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus unchanged on
Wednesday, ahead of next week's presidential election of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to select a successor to the outgoing Prime
Minister Yoshihide Suga.

The board, governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, on Wednesday, voted 8-1, to hold
the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that financial
institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The board unanimously voted on the details of the scheme intended to
support efforts on climate change.

According to the outline of Climate Response Financing Operations, the
bank will start accepting applications for the operation from Wednesday
and its first loan disbursement is set to take place late December.

While higher long-term yields could ease the downward pressure on bank
lending rates and improve the [health][1] of banks, the Bank is expected
to keep its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate unchanged at -0.1 percent and its 10-year yield
target at 0.0 percent for the foreseeable future, Capital Economics,
said.

The BoJ said the [economy][2] is likely to recover, with the impact of
COVID-19 waning gradually, mainly due to progress with vaccinations and
supported by an increase in foreign demand and other fiscal measures.

However, the bank sees high uncertainties to the outlook due to the
impact of the pandemic on domestic and overseas economies. The bank
observed that exports and industrial production continued to increase
despite some exports and production affected by supply-side constraints.
