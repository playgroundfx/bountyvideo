The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in September,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed
on Thursday with a manufacturing PMI score of 57.3.

That's up from 52.0 in August and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Output and new orders returned to growth after a brief month of
contraction in August as manufacturers reported to have better adapted
to ongoing COVID-19 conditions. Improved demand meanwhile drove firms to
hire staff and acquire inputs at faster rates in September.

That said, supply constraints simultaneously intensified with suppliers'
delivery times having lengthened at the fastest pace since the April
2020 survey record. Shortages of inputs and delivery delays also led to
increased price pressures for manufacturers as input price inflation
accelerated to the fastest on record. Overall optimism amongst
manufacturers nevertheless sustained in September, with [business][1]
confidence having risen to the highest since June.

The survey also showed that the services index improved to 44.9 in
September from 42.9 in August. The composite index also improved, rising
from 43.3 to 46.0.
