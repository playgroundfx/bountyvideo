Consumer confidence in Australia took a hit in January, the latest
survey from Westpac Bank revealed on Wednesday with a consumer
confidence index score of 107.0.

That's down from 112.0 in December, although it remains above the line
of 100 that separates optimism from pessimism.

The January reading represents a 4.5 percent monthly drop following the
4.1 percent increase in the previous month.

An increase in the number of [coronavirus][1] cases is blamed for the
decline, along with the resulting lockdown measures in various parts of
the country.
