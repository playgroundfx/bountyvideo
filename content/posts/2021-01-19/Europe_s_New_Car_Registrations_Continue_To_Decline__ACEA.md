Europe's new car registrations continued to fall in December, data
published by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or
ACEA, showed on Tuesday.

Car registrations were down 3.3 percent on a yearly basis, but slower
than the 12 percent fall logged in November.

Data showed that the four largest EU [markets][1] reported very
different results. Sales in Italy declined 14.9 percent and that in
France slid 11.8 percent. Meanwhile, Germany registered a robust growth
of 9.9 percent and Spain's sales remained stable.

In the whole year of 2020, the market recorded its biggest yearly drop
in demand since records began.

EU passenger car market contracted 23.7 percent to 9.9 million units as
a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic. All 27 EU markets recorded
double-digit declines throughout 2020.
