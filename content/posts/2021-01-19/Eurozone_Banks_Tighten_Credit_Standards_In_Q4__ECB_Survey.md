Eurozone banks tightened lending conditions across all loan categories
in the fourth quarter, the January Bank Lending Survey from the European
Central Bank showed Tuesday.

The banks credit standards for loans to enterprises, loans to households
for house purchases and consumer credit were tightened in the fourth
quarter.

The lenders cited the deterioration of the general economic outlook,
increased credit risk of borrowers as well as a lower risk tolerance as
relevant factors for the tightening.

In the first quarter of 2021, banks expect credit standards to continue
to tighten for loans to firms and households.

The survey showed that firms' demand for loans declined further in the
fourth quarter, while demand for housing loans continued to increase
reflecting a catching-up in demand after the first lockdown period in
the second quarter.

For consumer credit and other lending to households, a net percentage of
banks reported a decline in demand in the fourth quarter.

Lenders noted that [coronavirus][1]-related government guarantees
supported credit standards and helped keep [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) and conditions for
loans to firms more favorable in 2020.
