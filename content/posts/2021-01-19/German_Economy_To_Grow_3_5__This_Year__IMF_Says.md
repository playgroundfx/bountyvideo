Germany's [economy][1] is set to grow 3.5 percent this year after a 5.4
percent contraction in the coronavirus-hit 2020, the International
Monetary Fund said in a report released Tuesday.  
  
The economic recovery in the biggest euro area economy would be choppy
and unevenly distributed across sectors, and with quarterly swings
conditioned by volatile infection dynamics through early 2021, the IMF
said in the Article IV Consultation report.

"The recovery should firm up once there is wide distribution of
effective vaccines, but output is not expected to return to its pre-
crisis level until 2022," the report said.  
  
"The baseline projection is subject to unusually large uncertainty, with
risks tilted to the downside as resurgent infection waves may trigger
renewed or prolonged lockdowns and deepen economic scarring."

Germany's export dependence and financial openness also make it
vulnerable to shocks to external demand, the lender said.  
  
Longstanding challenges related to population aging, infrastructure gaps
and an impending green energy transition will be compounded by
structural changes ushered in by the pandemic, the IMF added.  
  
The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 4.3 percent from 4.2
percent.

The short-time work program, known as Kurzarbeit, should remain the main
pillar of labor market support during the economic recovery, the report
said.

That said, the IMF stressed the importance of additional measures
targeted at groups hard-hit by the pandemic or not covered by
Kurzarbeit, particularly women, youth, and elderly workers, to prevent
widening inequality and deeper labor market scarring.  
  
The budget deficit is projected to narrow to 3.4 percent of GDP this
year from 6.3 percent last year.
