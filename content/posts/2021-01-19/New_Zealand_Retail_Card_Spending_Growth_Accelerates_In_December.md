New Zealand retail card spending growth accelerated in December driven
by higher spending on groceries, furniture and electronics, Statistics
New Zealand reported Tuesday.

Total retail card spending grew 3.5 percent year-on-year, which was
faster than the 1.4 percent annual growth posted in November.

At the same time, actual card spending using electronic cards climbed
4.3 percent or NZ$20 billion.

Retail spending rose in four of the six industries in December. Spending
on groceries and liquor had the largest retail industry rise, up 7.5
percent. Spending on long-lasting goods advanced 6.7 percent.

"The continued spending on groceries and liquor coincides with the first
month of the summer holidays," retail statistics manager Craig Liken
said.

Meanwhile, spending on hotels, motels, and other accommodation was down
32 percent due to the restrictions on international travel amid global
pandemic.
