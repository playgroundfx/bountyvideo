The euro area current account surplus declined in November due to a
sharp fall in secondary income, the European Central Bank reported
Tuesday.

The current account surplus fell to EUR 25 billion in November from EUR
26 billion in October. The surplus totaled EUR 24 billion in the same
period last year.

The visible trade surplus remained unchanged at EUR 34 billion and the
services trade surplus held steady at EUR 9 billion.

Primary income rose to EUR 1 billion from -EUR 5 billion a month ago.
Meanwhile, secondary income declined to -EUR 20 billion from -EUR 12
billion in October.

During twelve months to November, the current account surplus totaled
EUR 231 billion or 2.0 percent of euro area GDP, down from EUR 278
billion or 2.3 percent a year earlier.

At the same time, in twelve months ended November, the financial account
surplus dropped to EUR 221 billion from EUR 229 billion in the same
period last year.
