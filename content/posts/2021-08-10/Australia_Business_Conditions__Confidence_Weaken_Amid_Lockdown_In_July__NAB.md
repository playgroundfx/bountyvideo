Australia's [business][1] conditions and confidence declined sharply in
July amid strict restrictions in many states to curb the spread of the
virus, survey results from National Australia Bank showed on Tuesday.

The business conditions index fell to 11 in July from 25 in June.
Conditions softened in all industries, with the exception of mining -
where it remained elevated.

The deterioration in conditions has been less severe than 2020, but
could worsen should lockdowns persist or become more widespread, NAB
cautioned.

The forward-looking indicators also softened and, with forward orders
now back in negative territory and capacity utilization now back around
average, suggest little improvement in conditions in the near term, NAB
said.

The business confidence index came in at -8 in July versus +11 in the
previous month. Transport and utilities, manufacturing and finance,
business and property reported very large declines in July.

"It is now widely expected that we will see a negative print for GDP in
Q3," Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB, said.

"However, we know that once restrictions are removed that the
[economy][2] has tended to rebound relatively quickly. We will continue
to track the survey very closely for an indication of just how quickly
that happens - particularly forward orders and capacity utilisation as
we assess how the disruption has fed into expansion plans as conditions
bounce back," Oster, added.
