Preliminary data released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed
labor productivity in the U.S. increased by much less than expected in
the second quarter.

The Labor Department said labor productivity jumped by 2.3 percent in
the second quarter after soaring by a downwardly revised 4.3 percent in
the first quarter.

Economists had expected productivity to surge up by 3.5 percent compared
to the 5.4 percent spike that had been reported for the previous
quarter.

The report also showed unit labor costs climbed by 1.0 percent in the
second quarter, just shy of economist estimates for an increase of 1.1
percent.

Meanwhile, the 1.7 percent jump in labor costs previously reported for
the first quarter was revised to a 2.8 percent decrease.
