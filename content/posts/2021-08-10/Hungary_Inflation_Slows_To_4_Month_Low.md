Hungary's consumer price inflation eased to a four-month low in July,
data published by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on
Tuesday.

Consumer prices grew 4.6 percent on a yearly basis, slower than the 5.3
percent increase seen in June. This was the lowest since March, when
prices were up 3.7 percent. The rate of growth was forecast to slow to
4.8 percent.

Nonetheless, inflation continued to stay above the central bank's target
range of 2-4 percent.

There were significant increases in prices of alcoholic beverages and
tobacco and motor fuels. Food prices advanced 3.1 percent and alcoholic
beverages and tobacco prices surged 11.1 percent. Motor fuel prices
became 19.8 percent higher.

Month-on-month, consumer prices were up 0.5 percent versus 0.6 percent
in June.

Core inflation eased to 3.5 percent in July from 3.8 percent in June. On
a monthly basis, core inflation came in at 0.4 percent, down from 0.6
percent in the prior month.

The central bank had raised its key base rate by 30 basis points each in
June and July, citing the above target inflation.
