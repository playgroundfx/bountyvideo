Preliminary data released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed
labor productivity in the U.S. increased by much less than expected in
the second quarter.

The Labor Department said labor productivity jumped by 2.3 percent in
the second quarter after soaring by a downwardly revised 4.3 percent in
the first quarter.

Economists had expected productivity to surge up by 3.5 percent compared
to the 5.4 percent spike that had been reported for the previous
quarter.

The smaller than expected increase in productivity, a measure of output
per hour, came as a 7.9 percent leap in output was partly offset by a
5.5 percent jump in hours worked.

"We anticipate limited productivity scarring from the pandemic and
expect a mix of cyclical and structural factors will power above-trend
productivity growth in the post-Covid era," said Lydia Boussour, Lead
U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "These factors include a strong investment cycle, increased
[business][1] dynamism, faster technology adoption, and lasting remote
work."

The report also showed unit labor costs climbed by 1.0 percent in the
second quarter, just shy of economist estimates for an increase of 1.1
percent.

Meanwhile, the 1.7 percent jump in labor costs previously reported for
the first quarter was revised to a 2.8 percent decrease.

The Labor Department said hourly compensation surged up by 3.3 percent
in the second quarter after climbing by a revised 1.4 percent in the
first quarter.

Real hourly compensation, which takes into account changes in consumer
prices, tumbled by 4.8 percent in the second quarter after slumping by
2.2 percent in the first quarter.
