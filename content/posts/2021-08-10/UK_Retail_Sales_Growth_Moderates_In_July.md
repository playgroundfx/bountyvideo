UK retail sales continued to grow in July but the pace of growth slowed,
the British Retail Consortium reported Tuesday.

Total retail sales grew 6.4 percent on a yearly basis in July. At the
same time, like-for-like sales were up 4.7 percent.

The lifting of restrictions did not bring the anticipated in-store
boost, with the wet weather leaving consumers reluctant to visit
shopping destinations, Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

Paul Martin, retail partner, KPMG, said retail sales grew at a slower
rate as the reopening of the hospitality and leisure sectors led to a
dilution in consumer spending.

Over the coming months the [health][1] of the sector is expected to grow
at a much slower rate as retailers face increasing challenges on a
number of fronts, said Martin.
