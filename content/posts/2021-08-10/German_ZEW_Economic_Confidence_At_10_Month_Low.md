German economic confidence deteriorated more-than-expected to a ten-
month low in August, survey data from the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for
European Economic Research showed Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany fell to 40.4 from
63.3 in July. The score was forecast to drop moderately to 56.7.

With the third consecutive drop in index, the reading reached its lowest
since November 2020.

Meanwhile, the assessment of the economic situation advanced 7.4 points
to 29.3 points in August. But this was slightly below the economists'
forecast of 30.0.

The third straight fall in expectations points to increasing risks for
the German [economy][1], such as from a possible fourth COVID-19 wave
starting in autumn or a slowdown in growth in China, ZEW President Achim
Wambach, said.

"The clear improvement in the assessment of the economic situation,
which has been ongoing for months, shows that expectations are also
weakening due to the higher growth already achieved," Wambach added.

The financial market experts' sentiment concerning the economic
development of the euro area also weakened for the third consecutive
time. The corresponding index decreased 18.5 points to 42.7 points in
August.

By contrast, the indicator for the current economic situation climbed
8.6 to 14.6 points in August.

Further, the survey showed that inflation expectations for the Eurozone
fell by 27.4 points in parallel with the decline in economic
expectations. The inflation indicator currently stands at 42.2 points.
