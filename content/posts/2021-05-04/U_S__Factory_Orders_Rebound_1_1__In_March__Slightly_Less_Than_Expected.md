New orders for U.S. manufactured goods showed a notable rebound in the
month of March, according to a report released by the Commerce
Department on Tuesday.

The Commerce Department said factory orders jumped by 1.1 percent in
March after falling by a revised 0.5 percent in February.

Economists had expected factory orders to surge up by 1.3 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent drop originally reported for the previous
month.

The rebound by factory orders came as orders for durable goods increased
by 0.8 percent in March following a 0.9 percent slump in February.

Orders for non-durable goods also shot up by 1.5 percent in March after
edging down by 0.1 percent in the previous month.

The report also showed shipments of manufactured goods spiked by 2.1
percent in March after tumbling by 1.9 percent in February.

Inventories of manufactured goods also advanced by 0.7 percent in March
following a 0.8 percent increase in the previous month.

With shipments jumping more than inventories, the inventories-to-
shipments ratio fell to 1.38 in March from 1.40 in February.
