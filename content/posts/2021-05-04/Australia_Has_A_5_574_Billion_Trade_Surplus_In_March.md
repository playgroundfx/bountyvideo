Australia posted a seasonally adjusted merchandise trade surplus of
A$5.574 billion in March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Tuesday.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of A$8 billion following the
upwardly revised A$7.595 billion surplus in February (originally A$7.529
billion).

Exports were down A$681 million or 2 percent on month to A$38.274
billion after slipping a downwardly revised 1.3 percent in the previous
month (originally -1.0 percent).

Imports rose A$1.340 billion or 4.0 percent on month to A$32.700 billion
after advancing a downwardly revised 4.7 percent a month earlier
(originally 5 percent).
