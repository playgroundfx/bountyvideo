The UK manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace on record in April
underpinned by production and new orders, final data from IHS Markit
showed on Tuesday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index rose to 60.9 in April from 58.9 in March and was above
the flash estimate of 60.7.

Output increased for the eleventh straight month in April. The latest
increase was attributed to a loosening of lockdown restrictions,
improved demand and rising backlogs of work.

Total new orders rose for the third straight month, largely due to a
further revival of domestic market conditions.

The degree of confidence among manufacturers was at its highest level in
seven years. Optimism reflected expectations for less disruption related
to COVID-19 and Brexit, economic recovery, improved client confidence
and planned new product launches.

Supply-chain delays and input shortages led to another near-record
lengthening of vendor lead times. Employment in the manufacturing sector
rose for the fourth successive month, with the rate of job creation
staying close to March's seven-year high.

On the price front, the survey showed that average selling prices rose
at the fastest pace since charges data were first collected in November
1999.

Although manufacturers have passed on higher input costs to customers,
it is hoped that this inflationary backdrop will subside once supply and
demand come back into line as covid-related logistic delays ease, Rob
Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said.
