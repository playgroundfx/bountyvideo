Ireland's manufacturing growth remained strong in April and the sector
expanded at a slightly faster pace, survey data from IHS Markit showed
on Tuesday.

The seasonally adjusted AIB factory Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
rose to 60.8 in April from 57.1 in March. Any reading above 50.0
indicates expansion in the sector.

New orders rose for the second straight month in April and new export
orders grew at the second-sharpest pace since February 2018.

Production increased for the second month in a row and at the fastest
rate in nine months. Backlogs of work rose at the second-fastest rate
ever recorded in April.

Firms output expectation for the coming 12 months strengthened on record
in April.

The number of workforce increased at the fastest rate since December
2017. Input buying increased in April and suppliers' delivery time
lengthened.

Input prices rose at the fastest pace in ten years and output prices
increased at a series-record pace.

"Firms widely expect vaccination programs to allow a full reopening of
economies, providing a major fillip to [business][1] activity," Oliver
Mangan, AIB chief economist, said.
