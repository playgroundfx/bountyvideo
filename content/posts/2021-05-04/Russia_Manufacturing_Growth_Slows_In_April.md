Russia's manufacturing expansion eased in April as output growth slowed
and new orders declined, survey data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The IHS Markit Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
eased to 50.4 in April from 51.1 in March. A PMI reading above 50
signals growth in the sector.

Output continued to increase in April and production grew at a softer
pace. New orders contracted for the first time due to weaker client
demand.

New export orders declined in April, albeit at a softer pace. Suppliers'
delivery time lengthened.

Input cost increased in April and the rate of cost inflation was the
fastest for six years. Selling prices increased and was the sharpest
since February 2015.

Employment continued to rise in April and backlogs of work declined.

"Nevertheless, optimism among firms continued to prevail as hopes of
economic recovery and stronger demand lifted confidence to its highest
since January 2020," Sian Jones, economist at IHS Markit, said.
