A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the U.S.
trade deficit widened in the month of March.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $74.4 billion
in March from a revised $70.5 billion in February.

The trade deficit was nearly in line with estimates, as economists had
expected the deficit to widen to $74.5 billion from the $71.1 billion
originally reported for the previous month.

The wider trade deficit came as the value of imports surged up by 6.3
percent to $274.5 billion, while the value of exports spiked by 6.6
percent to $200.0 billion.
