Swiss consumer sentiment improved in April as expectations regarding
economic outlook turned positive, quarterly survey results from the
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, showed on Tuesday.

The consumer confidence index rose to -7.1 in April from -14.2 in
January. The score has returned approximately to its pre-crisis level of
early 2020.

Among components of the index, the gauge measuring households'
expectations regarding general economic development climbed to +3.4, the
highest value recorded since autumn 2018, from -17.7 points in January.

Increasing likelihood of making major purchases also helped to raise the
consumer sentiment index. The corresponding index came in at -13.4
versus -19.6 in the previous quarter.

The index measuring the past financial situation rose to -12.0 from
-12.4 and the expected financial situation gained to -6.4 from -7.2 in
the preceding period.
