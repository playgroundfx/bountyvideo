British mortgage lending logged its biggest increase on record in March
largely driven by the extension of stamp tax duty holiday, the Bank of
England said Tuesday.

The lending secured on dwellings increased by GBP 11.8 billion in March,
which was the strongest since the series began in April 1993. Economists
had forecast and increase of GBP 5.8 billion following a GBP 6.4 billion
rise in February.

The number of mortgage approvals fell to 82,735 in March from 87,385 in
February. Economists had forecast approvals to rise to 92,300.

The BoE said the strong borrowing was driven by the expected ending of
the temporary stamp duty tax relief at the end of March, which has now
been extended to the end of June.

Data showed that individuals made significant net repayments of consumer
credit since March 2020. A further net repayment of GBP 0.5 billion in
March this year was, however, a little smaller than seen on average each
month over the past year.

Smaller firms borrowed an additional GBP 0.71 billion in March, while
large businesses repaid GBP 1.4 billion.

These figures provide another reason to think that consumer spending was
starting to gather some momentum in March, Ruth Gregory, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

And with consumers in position to power the recovery, this should mark
the start of a rapid recovery that will push GDP back to its pre-crisis
level in early 2022, the economist added.

Data revealed that M4 money supply increased 0.6 percent on month in
March, taking the annual growth to 8.9 percent.
