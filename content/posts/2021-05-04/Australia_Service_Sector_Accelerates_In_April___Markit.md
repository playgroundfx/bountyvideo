The services sector in Australia continued to expand in April, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday
with a services PMI score of 58.8.

That's up from 55.5 in March and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Business conditions improved amid faster expansions in both activity and
new [business][1]. Positive demand conditions, including a renewed rise
in new export sales, encouraged service providers to bolster hiring for
the sixth consecutive month to accommodate greater operating capacity
needs.

The survey also showed that the composite index improved to 58.9 from
55.5 in the previous month.

Overall business activity growth was supported by a considerable
expansion in manufacturing output and an unprecedented rise in services
activity in April.
