New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods unexpectedly decreased in
the month of February, the Commerce Department revealed in a report
released on Wednesday.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders slumped by 1.1 percent
in February after spiking by an upwardly revised 3.5 percent in January.

The pullback came as a surprise to economists, who had expected durable
goods orders to climb by 0.8 percent compared to the 3.4 percent jump
that had been reported for the previous month.

Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said the
unexpected drop in durable goods orders was "mainly due to the
disruption caused by the severe winter storms, which we already knew
weighed heavily on manufacturing output last month."

Orders for transportation equipment showed a notable pullback, tumbling
by 1.6 percent in February after soaring by 7.5 percent in January.

Partly reflecting ongoing plant shutdowns stemming from a global
semiconductor shortage, orders for motor vehicles and parts plunged by
8.7 percent.

Excluding the steep drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders still fell by 0.9 percent in February after surging up by
1.6 percent in January. Economists had expected a 0.6 percent increase.

Orders for fabricated metal products, machinery, computer and electronic
products and primary metals all decreased during the month.

The report also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a key indicator of [business][1] spending, fell by 0.8 percent
in February after rising by 0.6 percent in January

Shipments in the same category, which is the source data for equipment
investment in GDP, slumped by 1.0 percent in February after jumping by
1.9 percent in January.

"With the weather returning to seasonal norms and the next fiscal
stimulus payments already being distributed, orders are likely to
rebound in March and, as a result, business equipment investment still
looks on course for unusually strong growth of 10-15% annualized in the
first quarter," Hunter said.
