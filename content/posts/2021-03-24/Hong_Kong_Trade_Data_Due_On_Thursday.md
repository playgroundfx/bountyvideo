Hong Kong will on Thursday release February figures for imports, exports
and trade balance, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

In January, imports were up 37.7 percent on year and exports surged an
annual 44 percent for a trade deficit of HKD25.2 billion.

Thailand will provide February numbers for industrial production, with
forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.6 percent on year following the
2.8 percent contraction in January.
