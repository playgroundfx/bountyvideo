Iceland's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged for a second
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session in a row, citing stronger than projected economic
activity in recent quarters and slowing inflation.

The Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the key interest rate,
which is the rate on seven-day term deposits, unchanged at 0.75 percent,
the Central Bank of Iceland said in a statement Wednesday.

The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in
November.

Economic contraction in 2020 was 6.6 percent, which was slower than the
7.7 percent shrinkage that the bank projected in February.

While recent surveys and other indicators suggest a continuing recovery,
uncertainty is pronounced, the bank said.

Domestic as well as foreign economic developments will depend on the
path of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic and the progress made in
vaccination, the bank added.

Effects of last year's depreciation of the kr√≥na still weigh heavily but
have probably begun to subside, the bank said.

The currency appreciated recently and inflation slowed in February.

"As a result, the outlook is for inflation to start tapering off this
spring, although the near-term outlook has probably deteriorated since
February," the bank said.

Though inflation expectations have risen slightly, the bank said it is
too soon to determine whether they have become less firmly anchored to
the inflation target of 2.5 percent.

The next [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session is scheduled for May 19.
