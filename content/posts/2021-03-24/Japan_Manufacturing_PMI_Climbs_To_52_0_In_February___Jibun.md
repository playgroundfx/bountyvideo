The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to expand in March, and at a
slightly faster pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank showed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 52.0.

That's up from 51.4 in February and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Output growth softened slightly, although new orders expanded at their
fastest pace since October 2018. But job shedding persisted and
sentiment eased to a nine-month low.

Japan's services PMI came in at 46.5, up from 45.8 in February, while
the composite index had a score of 48.3 - up from 48.2 in the previous
month.
