The euro area private sector returned to growth in March underpinned by
a record expansion in manufacturing as global demand continued to revive
from the pandemic, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The composite output index rose to an eight-month high of 52.5 in March
from 48.8 in February. The reading was forecast to climb to 49.1.

The score exceeded the neutral level of 50.0 for the first time since
last September, suggesting expansion in the private sector.

Divergent trends were seen by sector. Manufacturing output growth
improved sharply to a record high, while the service sector was again
hit by virus-related restrictions.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index reached a record 62.4 from
57.9 in the prior month. The score was well above forecast of 57.7.

Although the services PMI advanced to a seven-month high of 48.8 from
45.7 in February, the reading was below the neutral 50.0. The expected
reading was 46.0.

"The outlook has deteriorated, however, amid rising COVID-19 infection
rates and new lockdown measures," Chris Williamson, chief [business][1]
economist at IHS Markit said.

"This two-speed nature of the [economy][2] will therefore likely persist
for some time to come, as manufacturers benefit from a recovery in
global demand but consumer-facing service companies remain constrained
by social distancing restrictions," Williamson added.

The survey indicated that the first quarter GDP could be better than
expected, Bert Colijn, an ING economist said. With lockdowns being
extended into the second quarter though, the economist expects the rapid
economic rebound to take off later.  
  
According to flash survey, the manufacturing upturn in the currency bloc
was led by a record surge of factory production in Germany. Germany also
outshone in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of service sector performance.

Germany's private sector growth accelerated to a 37-month high in March.
The flash composite output index rose to 56.8 from 51.1 in February. The
reading was well above economists' forecast of 51.6.

The result was driven by improved performances across both manufacturing
and services.

The services PMI came in at 50.8 versus 45.7 in the prior month. The
expected reading was 46.2.

The manufacturing PMI advanced to 66.6 from 60.7 in the previous month
and well above forecast of 60.8. The latest score was the highest since
April 1996.

Meanwhile, France's private sector continued to contract in March with
the decline predominantly driven by service providers. Nonetheless, the
pace of decline slowed markedly from the previous month.

The composite output index increased to 49.5 from 47.0 in February. The
score was forecast to rise moderately to 47.2.

The services PMI came in at 47.8 versus 45.6 in the prior month and the
forecast of 45.5.

The manufacturing PMI climbed to a 39-month high of 58.8 in March, up
from 56.1 a month ago and above economists' forecast of 56.5.
