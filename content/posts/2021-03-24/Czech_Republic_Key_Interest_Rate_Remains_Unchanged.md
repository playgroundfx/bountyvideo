The Czech Republic's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged
Wednesday, for a seventh straight session, citing substantial risks to
the economic outlook.

The bank board unanimously decided to keep interest rates unchanged, the
Czech National Bank said in a statement.

The benchmark two-week repo rate was held steady at 0.25 percent, as
expected. The previous change in the rate was a 75 basis points
reduction in May last year at the peak of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The central bank reduced the rate by a cumulative 200 basis points last
year after a pre-pandemic quarter-point hike early February.

The bank left the discount rate unchanged at 0.05 percent and the
lombard rate at 1 percent on Wednesday.

The uncertainties and risks of the current forecast in the context of
the ongoing pandemic remains "very substantial", the bank said.

"A slower fading out of the unfavorable epidemic situation, and thus
slower opening of the domestic and European economies, remains the most
substantial risk," the CNB said.

"This could lead to a need to keep the monetary conditions accommodative
for rather longer than in the forecast."

The bank expects inflation to fluctuate around the target of 3 percent
this year and to be slightly above it next year as a result of an
increase in excise duty on cigarettes.

The CNB expects the [economy][2] to return to year-on-year growth in the
second quarter. The bank forecast economic growth of more than 2 percent
for this year and expects the pace to pick up further next year,
fostering a gradual return of economic activity to the pre-pandemic
level.

The koruna will continue to appreciate gradually, the central bank said.

Capital Economics economist Liam Peach expects the bank to provide
further guidance about the outlook for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at its meeting in May.

"We think the first interest rate hike to 0.50 percent will come in
November once most virus restrictions have been eased and the economic
recovery has started to take shape," the economist added.
