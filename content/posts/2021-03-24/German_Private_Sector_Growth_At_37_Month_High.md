Germany's private sector growth accelerated in March driven by a record
expansion in manufacturing, flash data from IHS Markit showed on
Wednesday.

The flash composite output index rose to a 37-month high of 56.8 from
51.1 in February. The reading was well above economists' forecast of
51.6.

The result was driven by improved performances across both manufacturing
and services.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 50.8 versus 45.7 in
the prior month. The expected reading was 46.2.

The manufacturing PMI advanced to 66.6 from 60.7 in the previous month
and well above forecast of 60.8. The latest score was the highest since
April 1996.

The survey hinted at the prospect of a better-than-expected economic
performance in the first quarter, Phil Smith, an associate director at
IHS Markit said.
