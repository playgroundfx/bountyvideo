Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged again on
Wednesday in a bid to support a highly uncertain economic recovery.

The Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate
unchanged at 0.50 percent, the Bank of Thailand said in a statement. The
decision was in line with economists' expectations.

The previous change in the key rate was a quarter-point reduction in May
last year amid the peak of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

Downside risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook
remained high in the period ahead and the [economy][2] would thus need
support from the continued low [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate, the Bank of Thailand said in
a statement.

"The Committee therefore voted to maintain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at this
meeting to preserve the limited [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) space to act at the appropriate
and most effective timing," the bank said.

The central bank lowered its growth forecast for the Thai economy for
this year and next to 3.0 and 4.7 percent, respectively, citing lower
tourist figures and the impacts of the new wave of the Covid-19
outbreak. A fast recovery in exports is expected to underpin growth.

The bank expects headline inflation to return to the target in the
middle of 2021.

Policymakers stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
tools if necessary, the bank added.

"With the economy set to remain in the doldrums both monetary and fiscal
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are going to have to remain loose for a long time to come,"
Capital Economics economist Gareth Leather said.

"We expect the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate to remain at its current level throughout
2021 and 2022."
