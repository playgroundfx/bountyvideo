Switzerland's [economy][1] is set for its worst slump since 1975 this
year due to the impact from the coronavirus, or Covid-19, and a revival
is likely in the second half of the year, if there is no second wave of
the pandemic, the Federal Government's Expert Group said in a report
released on Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product adjusted for sporting events is forecast to fall
by 6.2 percent this year, which is slightly better than the 6.7 percent
decline predicted in April, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs,
or SECO, said.  
  
That would be the worst slump since 1975, the SECO added.  
  
The unemployment rate is expected to average 3.8 percent this year.  
  
Experts expect private consumption to remain subdued for the rest of the
year due to the high uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and also
projected a significant reduction in investment in machinery amid the
underutilized production capacity and deterioration in businesses'
financial situation.  
  
The Swiss economy is likely to grow 4.9 percent in 2021, which is
smaller than the 5.2 percent expansion predicted in April.  
  
This projection is based on the assumption that no renewed
intensification of the [health][2] [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures becomes necessary,
that the second-round economic effects in the form of lay-offs and
corporate bankruptcies remain limited and that demand from abroad
returns to normal levels gradually.  
  
However, the labor market is expected to improve only very slowly and
the unemployment rate is forecast to climb further to 4.1 percent next
year. Employment is expected to log only a minimal rise.  
  
"The course the economy will take hinges on the progression of the
pandemic," the SECO said. "Forecast uncertainty therefore remains
extraordinarily high."

Further, the risk of upheaval on the financial [markets][3] and further
upward pressure on the Swiss franc is high amid rising debt levels and
the risk of defaults and insolvencies, globally, the report added.
