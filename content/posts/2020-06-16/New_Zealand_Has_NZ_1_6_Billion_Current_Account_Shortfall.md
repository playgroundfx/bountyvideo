New Zealand had a seasonally adjusted current account deficit of NZ$1.6
billion in the first quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand said on
Wednesday.

That missed expectations for a surplus of NZ$1.482 billion but was an
improvement over the NZ$2.66 billion shortfall in the three months
prior.

The seasonally adjusted goods deficit narrowed to NZ$213 million, while
the services surplus narrowed to NZ$983 million.

The primary income deficit widened to NZ$2.2 billion and the financial
account recorded a net outflow of NZ$7.7 billion.
