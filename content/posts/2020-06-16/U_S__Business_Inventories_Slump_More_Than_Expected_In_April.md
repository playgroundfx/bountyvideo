A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a bigger
than expected decrease in U.S. [business][1] inventories in the month of
April.

The Commerce Department said business inventories tumbled by 1.3 percent
in April after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in March.

Economists had expected business inventories to decrease by 0.8 percent
compared to the 0.2 percent dip originally reported for the previous
month.

The bigger than expected decrease reflected a sharp pullback in retail
inventories, which plunged by 3.7 percent in April after jumping by 1.1
percent in March.

Manufacturing inventories also fell by 0.4 percent in April after
slumping by 1.1 percent in March, while wholesale inventories rose by
0.3 percent after tumbling by 1.1 percent.

The report also showed business sales plummeted by 14.4 percent in April
following a 5.2 percent nosedive in the previous month.

Wholesale sales plunged by 16.9 percent, while manufacturing and retail
sales cratered by 13.5 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively.

With sales falling by much more than inventories, the total business
inventories/sales ratio spiked to 1.67 in April from 1.45 in March.
