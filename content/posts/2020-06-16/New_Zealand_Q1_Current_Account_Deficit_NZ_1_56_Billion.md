New Zealand posted a seasonally adjusted current account deficit of
NZ$1.56 billion in the first quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand
said on Wednesday.

That missed expectations for a surplus of NZ$1.482 billion but was an
improvement over the NZ$2.66 billion shortfall in the three months
prior.

The seasonally adjusted goods deficit narrowed to NZ$213 million, while
the services surplus narrowed to NZ$983 million.

The primary income deficit widened to NZ$2.2 billion and the financial
account recorded a net outflow of NZ$7.7 billion.

The smaller deficit was driven by trade in goods with the goods deficit
narrowing NZ$613 million to NZ$213 million. New Zealand's services
surplus narrowed by NZ$83 million to NZ$983 million during the quarter.

"Travel restrictions began in early February to combat the spread of
COVID-19, followed by a shutdown of New Zealand's borders to all non-
residents from 19 March," international statistics senior manager Peter
Dolan said.

A NZ$342 million fall in spending by international students and visitors
was the main driver for the overall fall in services exports (down
NZ$460 million), followed by a fall in transportation services exports,
down NZ$83 million.

Services imports were also down NZ$376 million during the quarter with
travel services imports down NZ$165 million and transportation services
imports down NZ$63 million.

Volatility in world financial [markets][1], sparked by the COVID-19
pandemic, caused large valuation changes in our international assets and
liabilities. This drove a net rise of NZ$10.1 billion in net
international liability position.

New Zealand's net international liability position reached NZ$182.0
billion (58.0 percent of GDP), the highest percentage of GDP since the
December 2016 quarter.

Foreign investment in New Zealand earned overseas [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s NZ$4.1
billion in Q1, NZ$110 million less than in the December 2019 quarter.
This was driven by a fall in income earned on portfolio investment
(NZ$327 million) but was partly offset by an increase in income earned
on direct investment (NZ$224 million).
