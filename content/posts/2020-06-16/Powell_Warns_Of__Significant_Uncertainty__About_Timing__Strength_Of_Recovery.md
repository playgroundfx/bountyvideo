Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged recent signs of
improvement in the [economy][1] during congressional testimony on
Tuesday but cautioned that "significant uncertainty remains about the
timing and strength of the recovery."

During his semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,
Powell noted some recent indicators have pointed to stabilization and
even a modest rebound in economic activity following the
[coronavirus][2]-induced downturn.

Powell specifically cited the Labor Department's recent jobs report
showing employment unexpectedly jumped by 2.5 million jobs in the month
of May.

The Fed chief attributed the surprise job growth to some businesses
reopening amid the easing of restrictions on mobility and commerce and
the extension of federal loans and grants as well as stimulus checks and
unemployment benefits supporting household incomes and spending.

However, Powell noted that output and employment levels remain far below
their pre-pandemic levels and warned that there continues to be
significant uncertainty about the economic outlook.

"Much of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path
of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it," Powell said.
"Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full
recovery is unlikely."

The Fed Chair cautioned that a prolonged economic downturn has the
potential to create longer-term damage from permanent job loss and
[business][3] closures.

"Long periods of unemployment can erode workers' skills and hurt their
future job prospects," Powell said. "Persistent unemployment can also
negate the gains made by many disadvantaged Americans during the long
expansion."

"If a small or medium-sized business becomes insolvent because the
economy recovers too slowly, we lose more than just that business," he
added. "These businesses are the heart of our economy and often embody
the work of generations."

In light of the continued uncertainty, Powell said the Fed remains
committed to using its full range of tools to support the economy and
reiterated that interest rates will remain at current near-zero levels
until the central bank is confident that the economy has weathered
recent events.

The Fed's latest economic projections indicated most central bank
officials expect rates to remain at current levels through 2022.

Powell also touched on the Fed's recent move to start buying individual
corporate bonds, which he said is intended to support employment and
spending.

When asked about the move in the question-and-answer portion of his
testimony, Powell explained that decision was made out of an "excess of
caution" to preserve gains for market function.

"If the market function continues to improve, then we are happy to slow
or even stop the purchases. If it goes the other way, we will increase,"
Powell said. "I don't see us as wanting to run through the bond market
like an elephant."

Commenting on Powell's prepared remarks, Michael Pearce, Senior US
Economist at Capital Economics, noted there was no mention of potential
future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools the Fed might turn to, including explicit caps on
Treasury yields.

"With yields currently at very low levels, there is little need for such
a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) yet, so for now we expect the Fed's emphasis to remain on
ensuring its lending programs are operating smoothly, while adding to
calls for fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to provide more support," Pearce said.

Powell is scheduled to make his second virtual appearance on Capitol
Hill on Wednesday, when he testifies before the House Financial Services
Committee.
