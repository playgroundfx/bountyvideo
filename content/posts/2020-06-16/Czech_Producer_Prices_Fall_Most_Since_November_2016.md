The Czech Republic's producer prices declined at the fastest pace since
late-2016 in May, figures from the Czech Statistical Office showed on
Tuesday.

The industrial producer price index decreased 0.9 percent year-on-year
in May, following a 0.8 percent decline in April. Economists had
expected a 1.7 percent fall. This was the biggest contraction since
November 2016.

Prices for mining and quarrying declined 3.1 percent annually in May  
and manufacturing cost fell 2.6 percent. Energy prices decreased 6.9
percent.

Meanwhile, prices for electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning grew
8.0 percent. Prices for water supply and food, beverages and tobacco,
rose by 6.4 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.4 percent in May, largely due
to lower prices in 'coke, refined petroleum products'. Economists had
expected a fall of 0.3 percent.
