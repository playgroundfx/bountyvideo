Suggesting housing is well positioned to lead a post-pandemic economic
recovery, the National Association of Home Builders released a report on
Tuesday showing a continued rebound in U.S. homebuilder confidence in
the month of June.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index spiked to 58
in June from 37 in May, continuing to rebound from the nearly eight-year
low of 30 set in April. Economists had expected the index to climb to
45.

"Housing clearly shows signs of momentum as challenges and opportunities
exist in the single-family market," said NAHB Chief Economist Robert
Dietz. "Builders report increasing demand for families seeking single-
family homes in inner and outer suburbs that feature lower density
neighborhoods."

He added, "At the same time, elevated unemployment and the risk of new,
local virus outbreaks remain a risk to the housing market."

The much bigger than expected jump by the housing market index reflected
substantial increases by all three component indices.

The index gauging current sales conditions surged up to 63 in June from
42 in May, while the component measuring sales expectations in the next
six months soared to 68 from 46 and the measure charting traffic of
prospective buyers vaulted to 43 from 21.

Looking at the monthly average regional HMI scores, the NAHB said the
Northeast surged 31 point to 48, the South jumped 20 points to 62, the
Midwest posted a 19-point gain to 51 and the West catapulted 22 points
to 66.

On Wednesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of May.

Housing starts are expected to jump to an annual rate of 1.095 million
in May from 891,000 in April, while building permits are expected to
surge up to an annual rate of 1.228 million from 1.066 million.
