Japan's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged and expanded
the size of the [coronavirus][1] lending program on Tuesday to support
the coronavirus pandemic-hit [economy][2].

The Policy Board of the Bank of Japan voted 8-1 to retain the interest
rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that financial institutions
maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The central bank raised the size of the coronavirus lending program to
JPY 110 trillion from JPY 75 trillion. The program includes purchases of
commercial paper and corporate bonds in addition to loans to banks.

The credit easing measures implemented included purchasing corporate
debt and lending measures to support small businesses and households.

The BoJ reiterated that its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate would remain at present
or lower levels and added that it would closely monitor the impact of
Covid-19 and is prepared to take additional easing measures if
necessary.

The BoJ expects the Japanese economy is to remain in a severe situation
for the time being due to the impact of Covid-19 at home and abroad.

"As the impact of COVID-19 subsides, the economy is likely to improve,
supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's
economic measures, as well as through the expected materialization of
pent-up demand and a projected recovery in production from the decline
brought about by COVID-19," the bank said.

Inflation excluding fresh food is likely to be negative for the time
being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the decline in crude oil prices,
the bank said. The BoJ expects the core inflation rate to turn positive
as the economy improves, and then increase gradually.

Regarding the risks to the outlook, the BoJ pointed out that there have
been extremely high uncertainties over the consequences of Covid-19 and
the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies.  
  
"It is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of
COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth
expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning
of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system
stability being maintained," the central bank said.

Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant do not expect the BoJ to
boost its lending program any further. The total amount of support for
corporate funding is now equivalent to nearly 20 percent of the debt of
non-financial firms and bank lending surged by a massive 3.3 percent
between March and May, the economist pointed out.

Thieliant also do not expect the bank to cut its interest rates once the
virus is brought under control on concerns of the impact of the low
interest rates on the [health][3] of the banking sector.
