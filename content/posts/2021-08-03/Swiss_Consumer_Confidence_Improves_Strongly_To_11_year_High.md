Switzerland's consumer confidence rose sharply in July to its highest
level in over a decade as households turned strongly optimistic
regarding the [economy][1], survey data from the State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs showed Tuesday.

The consumer confidence index rose to 7.8 from -6.5 in the previous
quarter. The latest consumer confidence reading was well above its long-
term average of -5 points and its highest level since July 2010.

More people now expect a general upswing in the economy and a fall in
unemployment, the SECO said.  
  
The sub-index reflecting the expectations of general economic growth
climbed to 48.5 from 5.2. The score was the highest since the survey
began in 1972.  
  
The index measuring expectations on the future financial situation
climbed to 2.6 from -6.0. The reading was above its long-term average
for the first time in over six years.  
  
The gauge indicating households' willingness to make major purchases
rose to -12.1 from -13.2.
