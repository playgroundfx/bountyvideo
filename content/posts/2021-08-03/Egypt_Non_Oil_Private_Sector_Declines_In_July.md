Output decreased for the seventh time in eight months and new orders
declined in July.

Staffing level increased for the first time since October 2019 and
backlogs of work increased for eight months.

Confidence for the coming year continued to exceed the series average in
July on hopes that the pandemic will end. Delivery time lengthened in
July.

Input price inflation was the lowest since March and output charges
