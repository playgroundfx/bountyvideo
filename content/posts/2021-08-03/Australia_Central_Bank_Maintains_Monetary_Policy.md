Australia central bank left its key interest rate and the yield target
for government bonds unchanged, as widely expected, on Tuesday.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a record low of
0.10 percent.

The board maintained the target of 10 basis points for the April 2024
Australian Government bond.

The board also decided to continue to purchase government securities at
the rate of A$5 billion a week until early September and then A$4
billion a week until at least mid November.

The bank reiterated that it will not increase the cash rate until actual
inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. The
central scenario for the [economy][1] is that this condition will not be
met before 2024.
