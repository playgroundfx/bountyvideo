The UAE non-oil private sector growth was the fastest in two years in
July, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.0 in July from 52.2 in June. A
score above 50 indicates expansion.

Output and new order indices increased to the highest level since July
2019. Export sales fell for the third straight month.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in July and backlogs of work
increased.

The rate of job creation was the fastest since January 2019 and
purchasing activity increased.

Input prices increased in July and output charges rose for the second
month in a row.

The 12-month outlook remained positive in July with the hope of easing
Covid-19 restrictions and the Expo 2020. The overall [business][1]
expectations declined for the first time in eight months.
