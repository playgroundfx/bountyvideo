The manufacturing sector in New Zealand fell deeply back into
contraction in August, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on
Friday with a manufacturing PMI score of 40.1.

That's down sharply from 62.2 in July, and it moves well beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

A renewed nationwide lockdown in response to Covid-19 is the culprit.

Individually, production, deliveries, finished stocks and new orders all
contracted, while employment somehow continued to expand.

"Employment (54.5) managed to keep its head above water, but all other
sub-index values were in contraction with Production (27.7) the hardest
hit," BusinessNZ's executive director for manufacturing Catherine Beard
said.

"Although manufacturers outside of Auckland have returned to alert
levels that allow [business][1] operations to restart, any moves towards
the sector getting back into expansion will ultimately depend on how
soon Auckland can also return to lower alert levels."
