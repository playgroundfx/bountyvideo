Growth in Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity unexpectedly
reaccelerated in the month of September, according to a report released
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity jumped to
30.7 in September from 19.4 in August, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to edge down to 19.0.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said the survey's future general activity
and new orders indexes continued to moderate, but the surveyed firms
remained generally optimistic about growth over the next six months.
