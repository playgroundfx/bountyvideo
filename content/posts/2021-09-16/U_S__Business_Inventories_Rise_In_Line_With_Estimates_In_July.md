Business inventories increased in line with economist estimates in the
month of July, the Commerce Department revealed in a report released on
Thursday.

The report said [business][1] inventories rose by 0.5 percent in July
after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.9 percent in June.

Economists had expected business inventories to rise by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Wholesale and manufacturing inventories climbed by 0.6 percent and 0.5
percent, respectively, while retail inventories rose by 0.4 percent.

The Commerce Department said business sales also increased by 0.5
percent in July after jumping by 1.6 percent in June.

Wholesale and manufacturing sales surged by 2.0 percent and 1.6 percent,
respectively, more than offsetting a 2.2 percent slump in retail sales.

With inventories and sales both rising, the total business
inventories/sales ratio came in at 1.25 in July, unchanged from the
previous month.

"Inventories will stay scant relative to sales for the rest of 2021,"
said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics. "Strong
demand and supply side pressures in the form of high input prices,
logistical bottlenecks, hiring constraints, and raw material shortages
will drag on inventory restocking efforts."

He added, "We expect to see a more constructive environment for
inventory growth next year as supply chain pressures ease and sales
return to more normal and predictable patterns."
