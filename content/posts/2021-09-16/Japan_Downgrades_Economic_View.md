Japan's government downgraded its economic assessment amid rising
downside risks from the current domestic and overseas infections and
negative effects through the supply chains.

"The Japanese [economy][1] remains in picking up, although the pace has
weakened in a severe situation due to the Novel Coronavirus," the
Cabinet Office said in its September report.

The government lowered its assessment of both private spending and
industrial production.

The Cabinet Office said private consumption shows weakness further and
industrial production is picking up, although some weakness is seen
recently.

Further, the government repeated that [business][2] investment is
picking up and exports continue to increase moderately.

The government reiterated that corporate profits are picking up,
although some weaknesses remain in non-manufacturers due to the
influence of the infectious disease.

On labor market, the government repeated that employment situation shows
steady movements in some components such as job offers, while weakness
remains, due to the influence of the infectious disease.

Regarding short-term prospects, the government said the economy is
expected to show movements of picking up, supported by the effects of
the policies and improvement in overseas economies while taking measures
to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and accelerating
vaccinations.
