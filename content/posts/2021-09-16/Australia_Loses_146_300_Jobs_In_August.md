The Australian [economy][1] parted ways with 146,300 jobs in August, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

That was well off from forecasts for the loss of 90,000 jobs following
the addition of 2,200 jobs in July.

68,000 full-time jobs were lost last month, while 78,200 part-time jobs
were lost.

The unemployment rate somehow fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.5 percent
versus forecasts for 4.9 percent and down from 4.6 percent in the
previous month.

The participation rate slipped to 65.2 percent, missing forecasts for
65.7 percent and down from 66.0 percent a month earlier.
