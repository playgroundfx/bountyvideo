Europe's passenger car registrations declined in August and July after
four months of accelerated growth, data from the European Automobile
Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, revealed on Thursday.

Passenger car sales decreased 19.1 percent year-on-year in August
following a decline of 23.2 percent in July. Sales totaled 622,993 units
in August.

For the second month in a row, the largest car [markets][1] posted
double-digit declines.  
  
Sales in Spain posted the biggest fall of 28.9 percent. Italy's sales
decreased 27.3 percent and Germany's sales fell 23.0 percent. France
logged a decline of 15.0 percent.

Over the first eight months of 2021, sales volumes showed an increase of
11.2 percent, counting 6.8 million new passenger cars. Despite the weak
performance of EU markets during the summer months, substantial gains
earlier in the year kept cumulative growth in positive territory, data
showed.
