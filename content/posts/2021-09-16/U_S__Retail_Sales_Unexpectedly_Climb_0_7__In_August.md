After reporting a steep drop in U.S. retail sales in the previous month,
the Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing retail
sales unexpectedly rebounded in the month of August.

The Commerce Department said retail sales climbed by 0.7 percent in
August after plunging by a revised 1.8 percent in July.

The rebound surprised economists, who had expected retail sales to
decrease by another 0.8 percent compared to the 1.1 percent slump
originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail sales surged
up by 1.8 percent in August after tumbling by a revised 1.0 percent in
July.

Economists had expected ex-auto sales to edge down by 0.2 percent
compared to the 0.4 percent drop originally reported for the previous
month.
