Australia's leading index improved in September suggesting that momentum
continued to show a significant improvement consistent with the
[economy][1] moving out of recession, data from Westpac showed
Wednesday.

The six-month annualized growth rate in the Westpac Melbourne Institute
Leading Index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity
relative to trend three to nine months into the future, rose to -0.48
percent in September from -2.28 percent in August.

The leading index growth rate has lifted a whopping 5.11 percentage
points since April, data showed.

The main components driving the improvement have been US industrial
production, the S&P/ASX 200, aggregate monthly hours worked, the
Westpac-MI Consumer Expectations index, and the Westpac-MI "Unemployment
Expectations index.

However, these gains have been partially offset by a bigger drag from
commodity prices and the dwelling approvals.

Westpac upgraded its growth outlook for 2021 to 2.8 percent and that for
2022 to 3.5 percent.

Key factors behind the improvement are a boost to consumer demand, as
households spend around 50 percent of the personal tax cuts, and a lift
in [business][2] investment in response to the accelerated depreciation
allowances.

Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac expects the cash rate, the three
year bond target rate and the rate on the Term Funding Facility to be
reduced from 0.25 percent to 0.10 percent at the upcoming meeting on
November 3.
