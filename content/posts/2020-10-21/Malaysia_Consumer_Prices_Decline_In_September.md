Malaysia's consumer prices fell in September, data from the Department
of Statistics showed Wednesday.

Consumer prices declined 1.4 percent year-on-year in September, same as
in August. Economists had expected a 1.3 percent decrease.

The annual fall was largely driven by the decline in transportation
cost, when prices fell 9.9 percent.

Prices for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels declined 3.0
percent yearly in September and prices for clothing and footwear fell
0.6 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices remained unchanged in September.

The core inflation was 1.0 percent in September.

During the January to September period, consumer prices fell 1.1 percent
from the same period last year.
