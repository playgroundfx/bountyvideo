Belgium's consumer confidence weakened slightly in October amid a
resurgence of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, survey data from the
National Bank of Belgium showed on Wednesday.

The consumer confidence index eased to -17 from -16 in September.

"The deterioration of the COVID-19 pandemic has most certainly weighed
somewhat on consumer confidence, which has clearly been eroded over the
survey period, that nevertheless closed before the curfew and renewed
closure of bars and restaurants at national level were announced," the
bank said.

The survey period was from September 30 to October 15.

All of the sub-indicators were largely unchanged in October, except that
of savings intentions, which rose.
