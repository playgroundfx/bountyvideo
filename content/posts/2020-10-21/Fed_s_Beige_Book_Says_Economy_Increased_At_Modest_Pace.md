Economic activity continued to increase across all Federal Reserve
districts, according to the central bank's Beige Book report released on
Wednesday.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in the twelve Fed districts, noted the pace of economic
growth characterized as slight to modest in most districts.

The report said manufacturing activity generally increased at a moderate
pace, while residential housing [markets][1] continued to experience
steady demand for new and existing homes.

Banking [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s also cited increased demand for mortgages as the key
driver of overall loan demand, the Fed said.

Meanwhile, the Fed said commercial real estate conditions continued to
deteriorate in many districts, with the exception being warehouse and
industrial space where construction and leasing activity remained
steady.

The report also said consumer spending growth remained positive, but
some districts reported a leveling off of retail sales and a slight
uptick in tourism activity.

Employment increased in almost all districts, the Fed said, although
growth remained slow. Job gains were reported most consistently for
manufacturing firms, but firms continued to report new furloughs and
layoffs.

On the inflation front, the Beige Book said prices rose modestly across
districts since the previous report. Input costs generally increased
faster than consumer prices, although some sectors—notably construction,
manufacturing, retail, and wholesale—passed along the higher costs to
consumers.
