Eurozone money supply grew at a faster pace in April and credit to the
private sector growth accelerated further, data published by the
European Central Bank showed Friday.

The broad monetary aggregate M3 expanded 8.3 percent year-on-year in
April, faster than the 7.5 percent increase seen in March.

Likewise, growth in narrow measure, M1, improved to 11.9 percent from
10.4 percent in March.

Data showed that credit to the private sector increased 4.4 percent
after rising 4.2 percent in the previous month. At the same time, growth
in adjusted loans to the private sector slowed marginally to 4.9 percent
from 5 percent.

Loans to households grew at slower pace of 3 percent, while loans to
non-financial corporations rose at a faster rate of 6.6 percent.

Bank lending to firms jumped again in April, suggesting that government
loan guarantees and cheap ECB funding for banks are having the desired
effects, Jack Allen-Reynolds, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

As the central bank's work is far from done, the economist expects the
ECB to announce a further increase in its support for government bond
