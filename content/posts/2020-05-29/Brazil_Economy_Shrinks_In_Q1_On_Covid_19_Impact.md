Brazil's [economy][1] shrunk in the first quarter of 2020 due to the
impact of the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic, preliminary figures
from the statistical office IBGE showed on Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product decreased a seasonally adjusted 1.5 percent from
the first quarter, when the economy expanded 0.4 percent. That was in
line with economists' expectations.  
  
Industrial output fell 1.4 percent and services logged a 1.6 percent
decline. Farm output grew 0.6 percent.

Household consumption decreased 2 percent, while gross fixed capital
formation grew 3.1 percent. Government consumption rose 0.2 percent.

Exports shrunk 0.9 percent, while imports grew 2.8 percent.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, GDP fell a non-adjusted 0.3 percent after a 1.7
percent increase in the final three months of 2019. Economists had
forecast a 0.4 percent decline.  
  
The latest decline in the GDP highlights that the economy had slipped
into a deep downturn by March, even though the country was slow to
impose lockdown measures, Capital Economics economist William Jackson
noted.  
  
The economist said more timely figures point to a double-digit fall in
GDP in Q2.  
  
"With this coming alongside multi-decade low inflation, the central bank
is likely to cut interest rates further," Jackson said.  
  
The economist expects another 50 basis points cut in the Selic rate to
2.5 percent.
