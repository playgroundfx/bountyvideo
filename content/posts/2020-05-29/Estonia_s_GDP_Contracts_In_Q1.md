Estonia's [economy][1] contracted in the first quarter on weak household
spending and investment, data published by Statistics Estonia showed
Friday.

Gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent on a yearly basis in the first
quarter, compared to fourth quarter's 3.9 percent expansion.  
  
The impact of the [coronavirus][2] was not yet considerable, Robert
Müürsepp, leading analyst at Statistics Estonia, said. "However, the
virus seems to have negatively affected trade, transport and
accommodation and food service activities."

The main cause for the economic downturn were net product taxes, which
fell in the first quarter by 18.8 percent, mainly due to a drop in VAT
and fuel excise duty receipts, the agency added.

Household consumption growth decelerated sharply to 0.3 percent and
investments declined 6.9 percent.

At the same time, exports dropped by 2.6 percent and imports by 5.2
percent.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was down by seasonally adjusted 3.7 percent in
the first quarter. Year-on-year, GDP fell by adjusted 0.8 percent.
