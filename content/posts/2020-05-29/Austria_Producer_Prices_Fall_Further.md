Austria's producer prices continued to declined for the eleventh
straight month in April, due to the effects of Covid-19 crisis, figures
from Statistics Austria showed on Friday.

The producer price index declined 2.4 percent year-on-year in April,
following a 1.5 percent fall in March.

The decline in producer prices was mainly driven by a fall in energy
prices and intermediate goods by 8.8 percent and 2.4 percent,
respectively.

Meanwhile, prices for capital goods rose 0.9 percent in April and those
for consumer goods increased 1.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices fell 0.8 percent in April, following
a 0.9 percent decrease in the preceding month.
