The UK car production was the lowest since the Second World War as
factories were closed in April amid [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, or SMMT, said Friday.

Car production declined 99.7 percent on a yearly basis in April. As the
coronavirus crisis forced plants to close, just 197 premium, luxury and
sports cars left factory gates in April.

The year-to-date car production was down 27.6 percent, with 121,811
fewer cars built, SMMT said.

Instead of making cars, manufacturers refocused efforts on producing
personal protective equipment including face shields, visors and medical
gowns for use by healthcare professionals.

According to latest analysis, car production could fall below one
million units this year. This would be lower than in 2009.

"Manufacturers are starting to emerge from prolonged shutdown into a
very uncertain world and ramping up production will be a gradual
process, so we need government to work with us to accelerate this
fundamentally strong sector's recovery, stimulate investment and
safeguard jobs," Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said.
