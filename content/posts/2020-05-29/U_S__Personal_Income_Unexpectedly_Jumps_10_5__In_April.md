Reflecting the distribution of stimulus checks by the federal
government, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday
unexpectedly showing a substantial increase in U.S. personal income in
the month of April.

The Commerce Department said personal income spiked by 10.5 percent in
April after tumbling by a revised 2.2 percent in March.

The jump in personal income came as a surprise to economists, who had
expected income to plunge by 6.5 percent compared to the 2.0 percent
slump originally reported for the previous month.

Meanwhile, the report showed a steep drop in personal spending,
reflecting the impact of the [coronavirus][1]-induced lockdown.

The Commerce Department said personal spending plummeted by 13.6 percent
in April after a revised 6.9 percent slump in March.

Economists had expected spending to tumble by 12.6 percent compared to
the 7.5 percent nosedive originally reported for the previous month.
