Reflecting supply-side challenges related to building materials,
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and labor, the National Association of Home Builders released
a report on Monday showing an unexpected dip in U.S. homebuilder
confidence in the month of July.

The report showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index edged down
to 80 in July from 81 in June. The modest decrease surprised economists,
who had expected the index to inch up to 82.

With the unexpected drop, the housing market index slipped to its lowest
level since hitting 78 in August of 2020.

"Builders are contending with shortages of building materials, buildable
lots and skilled labor as well as a challenging regulatory environment,"
said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz.

He added, "This is putting upward pressure on home prices and sidelining
many prospective home buyers even as demand remains strong in a low-
inventory environment."

The unexpected decrease by the housing market index came as the
component measuring traffic of prospective buyers tumbled to 65 in July
from 71 in June.

The index gauging current sales conditions also edged down to 86 in July
from 87 in June, while the gauge charting sales expectations in the next
six months rose to 81 from 79.

On Tuesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of June.

Housing starts are expected to jump by 1.6 percent to an annual rate of
1.597 million, while building permits are expected to climb by 1 percent
to an annual rate of 1.700 million.
