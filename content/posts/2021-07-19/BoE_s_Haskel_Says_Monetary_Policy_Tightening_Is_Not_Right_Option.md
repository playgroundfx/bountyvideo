Bank of England Policymaker Jonathan Haskel said the tightening of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is not the right choice for the foreseeable future.

"In the immediate term, the risk of a pre-emptive monetary tightening
curtailing the recovery continues to outweigh the risk of a temporary
period of above-target inflation," he said in an online webinar on
Monday.  
  
"For the foreseeable future, in my view, tight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) isn't the right
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," said Haskel.

The higher oil price will provide a temporary boost to expected CPI
inflation readings to above 3 percent by the end of the year, the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker noted. These pressures and erratic data readings should be
temporary and therefore could be looked through, he said.

As much of inflation will be high temporarily due to the low base and
the [economy][1] is fully not recovered yet and faces two headwinds over
the coming months: the highly transmissible Delta variant and a
tightening of the fiscal stance, tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would not
be the correction option.
