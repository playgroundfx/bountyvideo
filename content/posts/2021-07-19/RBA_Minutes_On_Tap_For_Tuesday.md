The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its July 6 meeting, headlining a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

At the meeting, the bank decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a
record low of 0.10 percent, as widely expected. It also scaled back its
quantitative easing program citing stronger-than-expected economic
recovery and suggested that interest rates will remain at the current
level until 2024.

Japan will release inflation data for June; in May, overall inflation
was up 0.3 percent on month and down 0.1 percent on year, while core CPI
was up 0.1 percent on year.

Taiwan will release June numbers for export orders, with forecasts
suggesting a surge of 29.45 percent on year - slowing from 34.5 percent
in May.

China will see July prime rate figures for its one-year and five-year
loans; in June, the rates were 3.85 percent and 4.65 percent,
respectively.

Hong Kong will see unemployment data for June; in May, the jobless rate
was 6.0 percent.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia are
closed on Tuesday for the Eid-ul-Adha; they will re-open on Wednesday.
