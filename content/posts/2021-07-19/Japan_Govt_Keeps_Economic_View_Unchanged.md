Japan's government retained its economic assessment for the second
straight month in July, the Cabinet Office said in its monthly report,
released Monday.

The Japanese [economy][1] showed weakness in some components further,
although it remains in picking up in a severe situation due to the Novel
Coronavirus.

The government maintained its view on private consumption, [business][2]
investment and exports.

Meanwhile, the assessment about business conditions was raised this
month, saying conditions show movements of picking up, although some
severe aspects remain.

Last month, the government said firms' judgments on current business
conditions appear to be pausing for picking up, while some severe
aspects still remain.

In the near-term, the government expects the economy to show movements
of picking up, supported by the effects of the policies and improvement
in overseas economies.
