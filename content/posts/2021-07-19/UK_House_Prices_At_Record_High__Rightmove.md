UK house prices increased to a new record high for the fourth straight
month in July largely driven by the shortfall of property coming for
sale, data from property [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove said on Monday.

House prices increased 5.7 percent on a yearly basis in July, but slower
than the 7.5 percent increase logged in June.

Month-on-month, house prices gained 0.7 percent, following a 0.8 percent
rise in June. The latest monthly growth was the largest at this time of
year since July 2007.

Rightmove said its analysis found a shortfall of 225,000 homes for sale
which, if available, would have helped to maintain a more normal level
of property stock for sale and would have helped stabilize prices.  
  
Data revealed a marked imbalance between supply and demand for homes
with four beds and more, resulting in an average price hike of 6.7
percent in the last six months.  
  
With the ongoing need for housing, high activity levels despite the June
stamp duty deadline now passing, and with residential property prices
appreciating better than many other asset classes, positive sentiment is
expected to continue.

It is likely that the first half of 2021 has seen a record number of
moves when compared with the first six months of any other year, induced
by the pandemic's side-effect of a new focus on what one's home needs to
provide, Tim Bannister, Rightmove's Director of Property Data, said.

Demand has also been boosted by the ongoing creation of new households,
and property being seen as an asset to hold, with [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low
returns from many other forms of investment, Bannister added.
