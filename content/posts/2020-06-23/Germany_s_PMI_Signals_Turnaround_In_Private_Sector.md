Following a record downturn, Germany's private sector showed signs of a
turnaround in June, flash data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The flash composite output index climbed to 45.8 in June from 32.3 in
the previous month. This was the highest reading in four months and
above economists' forecast of 44.2.

The survey highlighted the effects of easing lockdown restrictions and
also an improvement in [business][1] confidence. There were identical
rates of decline in services business activity and manufacturing
production.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to 44.6 from 36.6
a month ago. The expected level was 41.5.

At the same time, the services PMI came in at 45.8 versus 32.6 in the
previous month and well above forecast of 42.0.

"However, while the loosening of lockdown restrictions has had a
positive effect on some parts of the [economy][2], the PMI's latest
reading is still within contraction territory, which shows this is
likely to be a protracted recovery as coronavirus-related disruption and
uncertainty continue to weigh on demand," Phil Smith, principal
economist at IHS Markit said.
