Australia's private sector rebounded in June reflecting the loosening of
restrictions related to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, survey results
published by IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The Commonwealth Bank flash composite output index climbed to 52.6 in
June from 28.1 in the previous month. A score above 50 indicates
expansion.

The increase was centered on the service sector, which saw a rise in
activity for the first time in five months. Meanwhile, manufacturing
production continued to fall, although at a much softer pace.

New orders stabilized, ending a four-month sequence of decline, but
companies continued to reduce employment as they generally operated
below normal capacity.

Input prices increased for the first time in three months. Output prices
also increased in June, but at a slower pace than input costs.

Confidence around the 12-month outlook for activity improved to the
highest for nine months amid optimism that economic conditions will
return to normal.

The flash services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.2 in June from
26.9 in the previous month.

At the same time, the manufacturing PMI came in at 49.8 versus 44.0 in
May.
