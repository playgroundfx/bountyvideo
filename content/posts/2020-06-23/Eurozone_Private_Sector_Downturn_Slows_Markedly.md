The euro area private sector contracted at a much slower pace in June as
lockdowns related to [coronavirus][1] pandemic were further relaxed,
provisional survey results published by IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The flash composite output index advanced more-than-expected to 47.5
from 31.9 in May. The score was forecast to rise to 42.4.

The latest gain took the PMI to its highest since February, though
indicating an overall decline in [business][2] output. Output decreased
again in both manufacturing and services, the latter showing the
slightly steeper rate of decline.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 47.3 from 30.5 in the
previous month. This was also above economists' forecast of 41.0.

Likewise, the factory PMI rose to 46.9 in June from 39.4 in May. The
expected level was 44.5.

The ongoing downturn in output was linked to a fourth consecutive
monthly deterioration of inflows of new business, which in turn
contributed to a further steep decline in backlogs of orders for
companies to work through.

The relaxation of some lockdown measures, and planned easing in months
ahead helped propel business sentiment for the coming year to its
highest since February.

The rate of job losses moderated in both sectors. Average prices charges
for goods and services dropped for the fourth consecutive month.
Meanwhile, input prices increased for the first time since February.

"While second quarter GDP is still likely to have dropped at an
unprecedented rate, the rise in the PMI adds to expectations that the
lifting of lockdown restrictions will help bring the downturn to an end
as we head into the summer," Chris Williamson, chief business economist
at IHS Markit, said.

Today's PMI numbers provide further evidence of what initially looks
like a textbook v-shaped recovery, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist
said.

As much as more than a month of lockdowns had sent economies into a
standstill, the gradual reopenings of the last two months have led to a
sharp rebound in activity. However, it is anything but certain that the
Eurozone [economy][3] can maintain this momentum, Brzeski added.

By region, France led the improvement with output returning to growth
for the first time since February. However, Germany lagged behind,
reporting a steeper fall in output than the rest of the region outside
of France and Germany.

France's private sector expanded for the first time in four months in
June. The composite output index rose to a four-month high of 51.3 from
32.1 in May. The reading was also above economists' forecast of 46.3.

Output growth was recorded in both the manufacturing and service
sectors, with the former posting its quickest rise in production since
February 2018.

The manufacturing PMI improved to 52.1 in June from 40.6 in May. The
expected score was 46.0. At the same time, the services PMI came in at
50.3 versus 31.1 a month ago and forecast of 44.2.

Although Germany's private sector showed signs of a turnaround in June,
the overall activity continued to shrink.

The flash composite output index gained to 45.8 in June from 32.3 in the
previous month. This was the highest reading in four months and above
economists' forecast of 44.2.

There were identical rates of decline in services business activity and
manufacturing production.

The manufacturing PMI advanced to 44.6 from 36.6 a month ago. The
expected level was 41.5. At the same time, the services PMI stood at
45.8 compared to 32.6 in the previous month and well above forecast of
42.0.
