Europe passenger car registrations are forecast to log its biggest fall
on record this year due to the major economic crisis posed by the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, on Tuesday
said, car sales will tumble around 25 percent in 2020.

Car sales for the year are seen at around 9.6 million units versus 12.8
million in 2019.

According to ACEA, the EU market contracted 41.5 percent so far this
year. This situation is expected to ease to a certain extent in the
months ahead as lockdown and containment measures are lifted throughout
the region.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of volume, the forecast for 2020 represents the lowest number
of new cars sold since 2013, when the industry had come through six
consecutive years of decline in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial
crisis, the association said.

"Given the unprecedented collapse in sales to date, purchase incentives
and scrappage schemes are urgently required right across the EU to
create much-needed demand for new cars," ACEA Director General, Eric-
Mark Huitema, said.
