Consumer prices in Australia were up 3.5 percent on year in the fourth
quarter of 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 3.2 percent and was up
from 3.0 percent in the third quarter.

On a quarterly basis, consumer prices rose 1.3 percent - again topping
forecasts for 1.0 percent and up from 0.8 percent in the three months
prior.

The most significant price rises were for new dwelling purchase by
owner-occupiers (+4.2 percent) and automotive fuel (+6.6 percent).

The ABS also said that the Reserve Bank of Australia's trimmed mean was
up 1.0 percent on quarter and 2.6 percent on year, while the weighted
median added 0.9 percent on quarter and 2.7 percent on year.
