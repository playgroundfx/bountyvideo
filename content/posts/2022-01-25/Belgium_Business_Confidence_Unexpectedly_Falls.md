Belgium's [business][1] confidence weakened unexpectedly at the start of
the year, preliminary data from the National Bank of Belgium showed
Tuesday.

The business confidence index dropped to 2.7 from 3.6 in December.
Economists had expected to reading to improve to 4.2.

Morale eroded in all branches of activity, except for business services
where confidence among company bosses improved.

industry revealed a slight drop in the capacity utilization rate to 78.5
percent in January from 79.1 percent in October last year.
