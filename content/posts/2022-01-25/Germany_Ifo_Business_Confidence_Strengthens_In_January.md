German [business][1] confidence improved at the start of the year as
companies expect the disruptions from the Omicron variant to ease in
coming months, survey results from the ifo Institute showed on Tuesday.

The business climate index rose to 95.7 in January from revised 94.8 in
the previous month. The reading was forecast to remain unchanged at
94.7.

While companies' assessments of the current situation were somewhat less
positive, their expectations improved considerably in January.

The current situation index came in at 96.1, down from 96.9 in December
and economists' forecast of 96.3.

Meanwhile, the expectations index advanced to 95.2 in January from 92.7
in the previous month. The expected score was 93.0.

The German [economy][2] is starting the New Year with a glimmer of hope,
Clemens Fuest  
President to the ifo Institute said.

With the Omicron wave likely to recede in February and March, the
economy should return to growth in the first quarter, Andrew Kenningham,
an economist at Capital Economics, said. The economy is expected to grow
0.5 percent sequentially.

In manufacturing, business sentiment jumped significantly as companies
were more satisfied with their current business, the survey showed.
Also, they were more optimistic about the coming months.

In the service sector, business confidence rose again after falling for
three consecutive months. Pessimism disappeared from companies'
expectations. However, service providers were less satisfied with their
current situation.

The business climate improved in trade. While companies' assessments of
their current situation were slightly worse, their expectations
brightened noticeably.

In construction, the business climate index rose. Companies were
somewhat more satisfied with their current business. The expectations
indicator also rose.
