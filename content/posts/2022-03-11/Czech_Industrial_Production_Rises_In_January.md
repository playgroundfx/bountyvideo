The Czech Republic's industrial production increased in January after
falling in the previous month and construction output growth eased, data
from the Czech Statistical Office showed on Friday.

Industrial production rose a working-day adjusted 1.0 percent year-on-
year in January, after a 1.6 percent decline in December. Economists had
forecast a 0.4 percent fall.

Manufacturing output grew 1.7 percent yearly in January and mining and
quarrying production increased 0.6 percent.

Meanwhile, electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning declined 3.8
percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 3.1
percent in January.

"January results of industry followed the trend from the end of the
previous year," Veronika Dolezalova, head of industrial statistics unit
at CSO, said.

"The production of motor vehicles decreased due to persisting lack of
parts and temporary shutdowns, however, other economic activities of
industry were successful and industry as a whole slightly increased."

Industrial new orders increased 6.9 percent year-on-year in January.

Construction output rose a working-day adjusted 6.4 percent annually in
January, after a 9.8 percent growth in December.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the construction output rose 1.6 percent
monthly in January.

"After five months, civil engineering construction surpassed building
construction as for the result, however, both the segments were growing
with a similar pace," Petra Curinova, Head of the construction
statistics unit, said.
