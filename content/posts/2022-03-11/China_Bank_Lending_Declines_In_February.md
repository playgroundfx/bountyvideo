China's bank lending declined more than expected in February, data from
the People's Bank of China revealed on Friday.

Banks extended CNY 1.23 trillion new yuan loans in February compared to
CNY 3.98 trillion loans provided in January. This was also below the
economists' forecast of CNY 1.48 trillion.

Aggregate financing declined to CNY 1.19 trillion, well below the
expected level of CNY 2.2 trillion.

The slowdown in lending suggests that more easing measures will be
needed to meet the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) objectives that were recently laid out at the
National People's Congress, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

The economist said [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are likely to be keen to see a renewed
rebound in credit growth over the coming months given the ongoing
economic weakness.

The next public easing move could come as soon as next Tuesday, when the
PBoC will have the opportunity to cut the rate on its medium-term
lending facility, the economist added.
