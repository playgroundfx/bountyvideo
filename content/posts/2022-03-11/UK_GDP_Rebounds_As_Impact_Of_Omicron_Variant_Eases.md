The UK [economy][1] rebounded at a faster-than-expected pace at the
start of the year after the impact of the Omicron variant eased, data
released by the Office for National Statistics revealed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.8 percent in January, in contrast to the
0.2 percent fall in December. Economists had forecast a marginal growth
of 0.2 percent for January.

GDP was 0.8 percent above its pre-[coronavirus][2] level. In three
months to January, GDP advanced 1.1 percent from the previous three
months.

All sectors expanded in January with services contribution the most to
the growth. Services output posted 0.8 percent expansion, underpinned by
wholesale and retail trade.

Industrial production was up 0.7 percent, preliminary driven by 0.8
percent growth in manufacturing.

Economists had forecast industrial output to grow 0.1 percent in January
after rising 0.3 percent in December. Similarly, growth in manufacturing
was seen unchanged at 0.2 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial output growth improved to 2.3 percent from
0.4 percent. Likewise, manufacturing gained 3.6 percent after rising 1.3
percent.

Construction output increased 1.1 percent, following an increase of 2.0
percent in December.

With high inflation filtering into higher price/wage expectations, this
would not stop the Bank of England from raising interest rates further,
with the next hike on Thursday, Paul Dales, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.  
  
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of a recession in
the UK by exacerbating the already acute inflationary squeeze on
consumers and businesses and derailing the supply of critical
commodities to many sectors of the economy, Suren Thiru, head of
economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said.

In a separate communiqu√©, the ONS said the trade deficit increased
sharply in January due to the surge in imports from EU countries.

The visible trade deficit widened to GBP 26.5 billion from GBP 12.35
billion in December. In the same period last year, the shortfall was GBP
15.3 billion. The expected deficit was GBP 12.6 billion.

There was a 20.7 percent decrease in exports to EU countries, while
exports to non-EU countries increased 4.2 percent. Imports from EU
countries gained 24.3 percent, while imports from non-EU countries
remained flat.

Data showed that merchandise exports fell 15.8 percent on month,
reversing a 3.1 percent rise in December. At the same time, growth in
imports accelerated to 21.8 percent from 1.4 percent.

Meanwhile, the trade in services resulted in a surplus of GBP 10.34
billion, which was bigger than December's GBP 10.02 billion surplus.

Consequently, the total trade balance showed a record deficit of GBP
16.2 billion versus a GBP 2.34 billion deficit in December.
