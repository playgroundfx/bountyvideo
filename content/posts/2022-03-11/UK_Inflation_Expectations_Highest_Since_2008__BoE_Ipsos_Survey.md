Inflation expectations among Britons reached the highest since 2008, the
quarterly Inflation Attitudes Survey from the Bank of England and Ipsos
showed Friday.

The inflation rate for the coming year is seen at 4.3 percent compared
to 3.2 percent expected in November. The 4.3 percent is the highest
since 2008.

The five-year ahead inflation expectations advanced to 3.3 percent from
3.1 percent in the previous survey period.

Further, the survey showed that by a margin of 59 percent to 7 percent,
survey respondents assessed that the [economy][1] would end up weaker
rather than stronger if prices started to rise faster, compared with 55
percent to 10 percent in November.

About 65 percent of Britons expect interest rates to rise over the next
12 months, up from 60 percent in the previous survey.

About 33 percent of respondents said the inflation target was 'about
right', down from 37 percent in November.

The war in Ukraine means that UK inflation is going to stay higher for
longer, James Smith, an ING economist said. That indicates that the BoE
is likely to raise rates again next Thursday and probably again in May.

However, Smith said [markets][2] are likely overestimating the pace of
tightening this year.
