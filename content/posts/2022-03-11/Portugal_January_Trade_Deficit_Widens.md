Statistics Portugal showed on Friday.

The trade deficit worsened EUR 1.939 billion from EUR 898 million in the
same month last year. In December, the deficit was EUR 2.424 million.

Exports rose 22.2 percent year-on-year in January, after a 24.1 percent
growth in December.

Imports grew 37.5 percent annually in January, following a 35.1 percent
rise in the previous month.

Exports and imports of industrial supplies and imports of fuels and
lubricants were significant in January, the statistical office said.

On a month-on-month basis, exports increased 6.6 percent, while imports
declined 1.8 percent.
