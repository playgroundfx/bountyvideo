Australia's central bank left its record low interest rate and
quantitative easing unchanged on Tuesday.

The board of Reserve Bank of Australia, governed by Philip Lowe, decided
to maintain cash rate and the targeted yield on three-year government
bonds of 25 basis points.

It is likely that fiscal and monetary stimulus will be required for some
time given the outlook for the [economy][1] and the labour market, Lowe
said in a statement.

The bank vowed to maintain accommodative approach as long as it is
required.

The Board will not increase the cash rate target until progress is being
made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be
sustainably within the 2-3 per cent target band, Lowe said.
