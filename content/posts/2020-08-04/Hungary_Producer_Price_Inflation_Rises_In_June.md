Hungary's producer prices grew at a faster pace in June after easing in
the previous month, figures from the Hungarian Central Statistical
Office showed on Tuesday.

The producer price index rose 3.1 percent year-on-year in June, after a
1.7 percent increase May. In April, prices rose 3.7 percent.

The development of prices was influenced by economic trends due to the
[coronavirus][1] epidemic, their impact was felt in the forint exchange
rate changes and the world market prices of raw and base materials, the
agency said.

Domestic market producer prices fell 1.1 percent in June, while foreign
market prices grew 5.2 percent.
