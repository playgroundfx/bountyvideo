India's service sector contracted sharply in July as restrictions
imposed to curb the [coronavirus][1] disease weighed on activity, survey
results from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The IHS Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index rose moderately to
34.2 in July from 33.7 in June. However, a score below 50 indicates
contraction.

Business activity and new work logged substantial reductions in July as
lockdown restrictions stifled demand and forced companies to cease
operations.

Subsequently, firms made further cuts to staff numbers, with the rate of
job shedding the most marked on record.

Looking ahead, the 12-month outlook for output was negative for a third
consecutive month, with fears of a substantial economic downturn common
among survey respondents.  
  
The survey showed that the composite output index, which measures
combined services and manufacturing output, dropped to 37.2 from 37.8 in
June. The score indicates a quicker rate of contraction, albeit not as
severe as those in April and May.
