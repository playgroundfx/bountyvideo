Thailand's central bank retained its record low interest rates as the
[economy][1] is expected to recover gradually in line with the
relaxation of the coronavirus containment measures.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank of Thailand unanimously voted to
retain the interest rate at 0.50 percent. The bank had reduced the rate
by 25 basis points in May.

Although the economy is forecast to recover gradually, overall economic
activities would take at least two years before returning to the pre-
pandemic level, the bank said.

given the economic outlook.

The bank expressed its willingness to ease [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) further. The MPC said
it would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools
if necessary.

Inflation is forecast to remain negative this year. However, headline
inflation would rise toward the target in 2021 in tandem with gradually
rising crude oil prices and the economic recovery, the bank said.
