Spain's service sector grew at the fastest pace in five months in July,
data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.9 in July from 50.2
in June. This was the highest reading since February. A score above 50
indicates expansion.

The survey showed that incoming new [business][1] disappointed and firms
continued to operate below capacity.

Jobs were reduced again, whilst expectations remained [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly
subdued. Operating expenses rose further, but profitability was again
under pressure as firms reduced output prices.

The private sector [economy][2] returned to growth in July, expanding
for the first time in five months as both manufacturing and service
sector activity increased.

The composite output index advanced to 52.8 from 49.7 in the previous
month, to signal a solid rate of growth that was the best since April
2019.
