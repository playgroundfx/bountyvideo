Sweden's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in five months in
July, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF
showed on Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector increased to 54.8
in July from 50.9 in June. This was the highest since February. Any
reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

A rapid improvement was seen in the services sector, though the
interpretation of the July outcome was normally more uncertain due to
holiday effects, Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said. "We need more
data to make sure if it is a lasting recovery."

All the sub-indices increased in June, except in employment which ended
up out of growth zone for the sixth straight month. Services providers
became less optimistic, but continued to rise.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
53.7 in July from 50.0 in the previous month. This was the highest score
in five months.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the [economy][1] in the
[business][2] sector has brightened in recent months, but so far the
effects on employment have been modest, even though the decline has
slowed down, Kennemar said.
