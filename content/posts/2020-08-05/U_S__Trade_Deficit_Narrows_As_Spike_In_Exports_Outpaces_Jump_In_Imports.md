Reflecting a sharp increase in the value of exports, the Commerce
Department released a report on Wednesday showing the U.S. trade deficit
narrowed in the month of June.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed to $50.7 billion
in June from a revised $54.8 billion in May.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to narrow to $50.1 billion
from the $54.6 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The narrower deficit came as the value of exports spiked by 9.4 percent
to $158.3 billion in June after tumbling by 4.3 percent to $144.7
billion in May.

Exports of automotive vehicles, parts and engines showed a significant
increase along with exports of capital goods and industrial supplies and
materials.

The jump in the value of exports outpaced a notable increase in the
value of imports, which surged up by 4.7 percent to $208.9 billion in
June after dipping by 0.7 percent to $199.5 billion in May.

Substantial increases in imports of automotive vehicles, parts and
engines and consumer goods were partly offset by a sharp drop in imports
of industrial supplies and materials, particularly non-monetary gold.

"The latest trade figures confirm that both exports and imports began
rebounding in June, and we expect a continued recovery over the coming
months as production catches up with the recovery in consumption," said
Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "However, with key U.S. export categories such as travel
services and commercial aircraft exports likely to remain depressed for
a while to come, we do not expect the trade deficit to continue
narrowing over the coming months."

The Commerce Department noted the goods deficit narrowed to $72.2
billion in June from $76.2 billion in May, while the services surplus
inched up to $21.5 billion from $21.4 billion.
