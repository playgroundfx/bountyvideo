The UK service sector logged its strongest growth in five years in July
as the phased reopening of [business][1] operations lifted corporate and
household spending, final data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The final IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply
services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.5 in July from 47.1 in
June. The flash score was 56.6.

The index has risen in each month after reaching a survey-record low of
13.4 in April, but the latest reading was the first to exceed the
neutral 50.0 threshold since the pandemic began.

The composite output index, which combines the manufacturing and
services, improved to 57.0 in July from 47.7 in June. The flash score
was 57.1.

The reading signaled the fastest growth in the private sector since June
2015. In the manufacturing sector, output growth was the strongest since
November 2017.  
  
In the service sector, respondents reported higher business activity due
to the easing of measures taken to curb the spread of the
[coronavirus][2]. New business volume increased for the first time in
five months. However, international travel restrictions contributed to a
sustained reduction in new export sales.

Backlogs of work in the service sector dropped again in July. A lack of
pressure on business capacity and weaker-than-expected demand resulted
in lower staffing numbers.  
  
Further, the survey showed that business expectations among service
providers rose further in July, with optimism reaching a five-month
high.

Finally, average cost burdens increased at a strong pace in July, but
intense competition for new work meant that service providers' output
charges were broadly unchanged since the previous month.

While the latest survey data provide a number of positive signs that the
UK [economy][3] is back in expansion mode, the weakness of the
employment figures reported in July is clearly a cause for concern and
likely to hold back the longer-term recovery in business and consumer
spending, Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
