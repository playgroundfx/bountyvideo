After four months of contraction, the euro area private sector expanded
at the fastest pace since mid-2018 as easing of Covid-19 lockdown
restrictions boosted demand and expectations, final data from IHS Markit
showed Wednesday.

The IHS Markit final composite output index rose to 54.9 in July from
48.5 in June. The flash reading was 54.8.

Both the manufacturing and service sectors reported marked rates of
growth in July, with manufacturing registering the slightly stronger
pace of expansion.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to 54.7 in July from
48.3 in June. But this was below the flash score of 55.1.

"Whether the recovery can be sustained will be determined first and
foremost by virus case numbers, and the recent signs of a resurgence
pose a particular risk to many parts of the service sector, such as
travel, tourism and hospitality," Chris Williamson, chief [business][1]
economist at IHS Markit, said.

The upturn in the private sector growth was broad-based by country, and
led by the region's biggest two economies.

France registered a considerable increase in activity, with the sharpest
growth for nearly two-and-a-half years. At the same time, Germany posted
its best increase in activity for just under two years.

At 57.3 in July, France's composite output index climbed to a nearly
two-and-a-half years high from 51.7 in June. The score was below the
flash 57.6.

The services PMI moved up to 57.3 in July from 50.7 in June. The flash
score was 57.8.

Germany's composite output index advanced to a 23-month high of 55.3 in
July from 47.0 in June. The flash reading was 55.5.

Recovering from a record low seen in April, the services PMI came in at
55.6 in July versus June's 47.3 and the preliminary reading of 56.7.
