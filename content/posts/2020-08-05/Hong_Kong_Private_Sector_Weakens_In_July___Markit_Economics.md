The private sector in Hong Kong continued to contract in July, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday
with a PMI score of 44.5.

That's down from 49.6, and it moves further beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders fell at sharper rates and there was
a renewed decline in purchasing activity. Business sentiment grew
increasingly pessimistic.

With sales weakening at a faster pace during July, firms in turn reduced
their input purchases as part of efforts to control costs and avoid
keeping excessive stocks.
