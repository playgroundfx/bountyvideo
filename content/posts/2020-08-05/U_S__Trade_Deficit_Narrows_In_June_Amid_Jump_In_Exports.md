Reflecting a sharp increase in the value of exports, the Commerce
Department released a report on Wednesday showing the U.S. trade deficit
narrowed in the month of June.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed to $50.7 billion
in June from a revised $54.8 billion in May.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to narrow to $50.1 billion
from the $54.6 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The narrower deficit came as the value of exports spiked by 9.4 percent
to $158.3 billion, outpacing a 4.7 percent jump in the value of imports
to $208.9 billion.
