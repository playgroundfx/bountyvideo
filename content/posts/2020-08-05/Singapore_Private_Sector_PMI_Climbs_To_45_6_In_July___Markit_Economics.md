The private sector in Singapore continued to contract in July, albeit at
a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Wednesday with a five-month high PMI score of 45.6.

That's up from 43.2, although it remains beneath the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, export orders increased for the first time in a year,
although job shedding persisted as cost inflation accelerated.

Total new orders contracted for a sixth straight month, though the rate
of decline was the weakest since January.
