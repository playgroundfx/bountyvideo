Consumer prices in the Philippines were up 2.7 percent on year in July,
the National Statistics Office said on Wednesday - exceeding
expectations for 2.5 percent, which would have been unchanged from May's
reading.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, advanced an annual 3.3
percent - up from 3.0 percent in the previous month.

The bureau also said that the country posted a merchandise trade deficit
of $1.303 billion following the $1.865 billion shortfall a month
earlier.

Imports were down 24.5 percent on year after plummeting 40.6 percent in
May, while exports sank 13.3 percent after dropping 35.6 percent a month
earlier.
