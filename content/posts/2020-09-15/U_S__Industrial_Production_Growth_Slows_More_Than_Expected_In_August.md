After reporting sharp increases in U.S. industrial production over the
three previous months, the Federal Reserve released a report on Tuesday
showing production rose by much less than expected in the month of
August.

The Fed said industrial production climbed by 0.4 percent in August
after soaring by an upwardly revised 3.5 percent in July.

Economists had expected production to jump by 1.0 percent compared to
the 3.0 percent spike originally reported for the previous month.

Production increased for the fourth consecutive month but remains 7.3
percent below its pre-pandemic February level.

"We are vigilant that future progress toward a full recovery in the
industrial sector will be slow and uneven as a [health][1] solution
remains out of reach and fiscal relief fades," said Oren Klachkin, Lead
U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

"While the travails are comparatively less severe than in certain
services sectors, industrial production risks remain heavily tilted to
the downside," he added.

Manufacturing output continued to improve in August, surging up by 1.0
percent, although the Fed noted the gains for most manufacturing
industries have gradually slowed since June.

The increase in manufacturing output was partly offset by a sharp
pullback in mining output, which plunged by 2.5 percent in August after
jumping by 1.4 percent in July.

The steep decline in mining output came as Tropical Storm Marco and
Hurricane Laura caused sharp but temporary drops in oil and gas
extraction and well drilling.

The report said utilities output also dipped by 0.4 percent in August
after spiking by 3.8 percent in the previous month.

Meanwhile, the Fed said industrial capacity utilization crept up to 71.4
percent in August from an upwardly revised 71.1 percent in July.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to climb to 71.4 percent
from the 70.6 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector rose to 70.2 percent,
while capacity utilization in both the mining and utilities sectors
dropped to 74.5 percent.
