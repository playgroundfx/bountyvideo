Industrial production in China was up 5.6 percent on year in August, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.

That blew away expectations for an increase of 5.1 percent and was up
sharply from the 4.8 percent gain in July.

The bureau also said that retail sales advanced an annual 0.5 percent -
also beating expectations for a flat reading after slipping 1.1 percent
in the previous month.

Fixed asset investment slipped 0.3 percent on year, again beating
forecasts for a fall of 0.4 percent after dropping 1.6 percent a month
earlier.

Finally, China's unemployment rate came in at 5.6 percent, beating
expectations for 5.7 percent - which would have been unchanged.
