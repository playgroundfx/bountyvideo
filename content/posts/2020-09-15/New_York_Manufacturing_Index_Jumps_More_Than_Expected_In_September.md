A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday
showed a significant acceleration in the pace of growth in regional
manufacturing activity in the month of September.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index jumped
to 17.0 in September from 3.7 in August, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to rise to 6.0.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months.
