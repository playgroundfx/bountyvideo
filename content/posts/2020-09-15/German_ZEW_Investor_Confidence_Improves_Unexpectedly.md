German [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence strengthened unexpectedly in September as
financial experts expect a noticeable recovery in the [economy][1],
survey data from the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research
showed on Tuesday.

The economic confidence index rose to 77.4 in September from 71.5 in the
previous month, while it was forecast to fall to 69.8. This was the
highest reading since May 2000.

The current conditions index advanced to -66.2 from -81.3 a month ago.
The expected level was -72.0.

"Stalled Brexit talks and rising COVID-19 cases could not dampen the
positive mood," ZEW President Achim Wambach, said.

"However, the still negative outlook for the banking sector reveals
fears of a rising number of loan defaults in the coming six months,"
Wambach added.

Sentiment concerning the economic development of the Eurozone also
improved in September. The corresponding index gained 9.9 points to 73.9
points. Likewise, the indicator for the current economic situation
climbed 8.9 points to minus 80.9 points.

The outlook for the Eurozone has improved noticeably, albeit to a lesser
extent than for Germany, the survey showed.

A report from Destatis revealed that employment in Germany's
manufacturing sector decreased by 2.9 percent in July from the last
year. The number of hours worked declined 8.5 percent annually.
