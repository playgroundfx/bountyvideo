New Zealand had a seasonally adjusted current account surplus of NZ$482
million in the second quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand said on
Wednesday.

That was shy of expectations for NZ$595 million and down from NZ$1.56
billion in the three months prior.

The current account deficit for the year ended June 2020 narrowed to
NZ$5.8 billion (1.9 percent of GDP) from an NZ$11.6 billion deficit for
the June 2019 year (3.8 percent of GDP).

New Zealand's net international liability position was NZ$180.1 billion,
compared with NZ$179.3 billion in Q1.
