New Zealand posted a seasonally adjusted current account surplus of
NZ$482 million in the second quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand
said on Wednesday.

That was shy of expectations for NZ$595 million and down from NZ$1.56
billion in the three months prior.

The current account deficit for the year ended June 2020 narrowed to
NZ$5.8 billion (1.9 percent of GDP) from an NZ$11.6 billion deficit for
the June 2019 year (3.8 percent of GDP).

New Zealand's net international liability position was NZ$180.1 billion,
compared with NZ$179.3 billion in Q1.

The seasonally adjusted goods balance was a NZ$2.2 billion surplus. The
seasonally adjusted services balance was a NZ$68 million deficit.

The primary income deficit narrowed to NZ$1.3 billion, while the
financial account recorded a net inflow of NZ$4.8 billion.

In the June 2020 quarter, seasonally adjusted goods imports fell 21
percent (NZ$3.2 billion) to NZ$12.5 billion while seasonally adjusted
goods exports fell 5.2 percent (NZ$812 million) to NZ$14.7 billion. The
seasonally adjusted goods balance was a surplus of NZ$2.2 billion, the
first quarterly surplus since the June 2014 quarter.

The fall in seasonally adjusted goods imports was led by falls in crude
oil and passenger motor cars. The fall in seasonally adjusted goods
exports was led by falls in meat and edible offal, and mechanical
machinery and equipment.

The seasonally adjusted services deficit was NZ$68 million in the June
2020 quarter, a NZ$725 million change from the NZ$657 million surplus in
the March 2020 quarter. Travel and transportation services were the main
drivers behind this change.

The primary income deficit was NZ$1.3 billion in the June 2020 quarter,
NZ$384 million narrower than the previous quarter. This was driven by a
fall in investment income from foreign investment in New Zealand, while
investment income from New Zealand investment abroad was largely
unchanged.

Income from New Zealand investment abroad was down NZ$14 million from
the previous quarter to NZ$2.1 billion, mainly due to a fall in income
earned on other investment (down NZ$264 million). This was mostly offset
by a rise in income earned on portfolio investment (up NZ$249 million).

Foreign investment in New Zealand earned overseas [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s NZ$3.3
billion in the June 2020 quarter, NZ$421 million less than in the March
2020 quarter. This was driven by a fall in income earned on direct
investment (NZ$477 million), mainly due to a fall in profits.

The financial account recorded a net inflow of NZ$4.8 billion in the
June 2020 quarter. This was made up of a NZ$9.4 billion net divestment
of New Zealand's offshore assets and a NZ$4.7 billion net divestment by
foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of their New Zealand investments.

New Zealand [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s brought a net NZ$9.4 billion back into the country
from assets previously held overseas. The main inflows were a NZ$10.4
billion divestment of other investment, settlements of NZ$5.4 billion in
financial derivatives assets, and a NZ$4.5 billion divestment of reserve
assets.

Partly offsetting these inflows of capital was a net NZ$10.8 billion
outflow of investment in portfolio investment assets mainly by the New
Zealand pension and investment fund sector.
