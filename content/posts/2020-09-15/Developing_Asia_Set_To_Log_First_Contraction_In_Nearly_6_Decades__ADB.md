Developing Asia is set to register its first contraction since early
1960s as the [coronavirus][1] pandemic continues to disrupt global
economic activity, the Asian Development Bank said Tuesday.

In its latest Asian Development Outlook Update, the lender said
developing Asia's gross domestic product will fall 0.7 percent in 2020,
in contrast to a 0.1 percent rise estimated in June.

Nonetheless, the growth outlook for 2021 was upgraded to 6.8 percent
from 6.2 percent. Despite the revision, GDP would be substantially below
expectations before Covid-19.

Consequently, the regional recovery will be L-shaped or "swoosh-shaped"
rather than V-shaped, the lender observed.

The lender cited threat of a prolonged Covid-19 pandemic and a return to
more stringent containment measures as the main risk to the outlook.

The ADB cautioned that a return to more stringent containment measures
could slow or even derail recovery and possibly trigger financial
turmoil. Although economies in developing Asia remain resilient, the
agency noted that continued [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support is needed to underpin
recovery.

Excluding high-income newly industrialized economies, regional GDP is
expected to contract by 0.5 percent this year before growing by 7.2
percent next year.

The two largest economies in the region are diverging as nascent
recovery in the People's Republic of China contrasts with continued
fragility in India.

China's GDP is forecast to grow 1.8 percent in 2020, unchanged from the
previous projection, while the outlook for next year is revised up to
7.7 percent from 7.4 percent.

Meanwhile, the lockdown has stalled India's [economy][2], and the
continuing outbreak looks likely to prevent economic activity from
resuming fully in the remaining three quarters of FY 2020, the agency
said. India's GDP is forecast to contract sharply by 9 percent this year
before rising 8 percent in 2021.

According to ADB, East Asia is slowing more this year but will rebound
higher next year. The sub-regional forecast is for growth in both years,
at 1.3 percent in 2020 and 7.0 percent in 2021.

South Asia sees economic woes deepen as Covid-19 spreads. The sub-region
is now expected to shrink by a steep 6.8 percent this year and rebound
by 7.1 percent in 2021.

Southeast Asia retrenches, waging tough battles with the virus. Strict
quarantines and travel restrictions inflicted brutal second-quarter, the
lender noted.  
  
Projected sub-regional GDP is revised down by nearly 5 percentage points
to 3.8 percent contraction in 2020, with the forecast rebound revised up
by nearly 1 point to 5.5 percent growth in 2021.

Central Asian economic prospects continue to dim. Accordingly, sub-
regional GDP forecasts are downgraded from low growth to 2.1 percent
contraction in 2020 and tepid 3.9 percent growth in 2021.

The outlook for Pacific is revised down substantially, to 6.1 percent
contraction this year and only minimal growth in 2021.

The inflation forecast for the whole region was revised down to 2.9
percent from 3.2 percent as the slowdown in demand is expected to
outweigh inflationary supply-side disruptions. The forecast for 2021 was
maintained at 2.3 percent.
