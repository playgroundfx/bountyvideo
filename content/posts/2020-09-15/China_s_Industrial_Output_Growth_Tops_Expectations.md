China's industrial production grew more than expected in August as
fiscal stimulus and exports boosted economic activity and retail sales
recovered on domestic demand, official data revealed Tuesday.

Industrial production growth improved to 5.6 percent from 4.8 percent in
July, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The rate was forecast to
rise moderately to 5.1 percent.

At the same time, retail sales advanced 0.5 percent on year, in contrast
to a 1.1 percent drop in July. Economists had forecast a marginal growth
of 0.1 percent for August.

Fixed asset investment declined 0.3 percent during January to August
period, which was smaller than the 1.6 percent decrease seen in seven
months to July and the 0.4 percent fall economists' had forecast.

The urban unemployment rate came in at 5.6 percent in August versus 5.7
percent a month ago.

The tightening labor market and revival in consumer confidence suggests
that the recovery in services activity has further to run, Julian Evans-
Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

What's more, growth in industry and construction is likely to remain
strong since fiscal spending is set to be ramped up further during the
rest of the year and the recent surge in industrial profit growth has
also boosted the prospects for manufacturing investment, the economist
noted.

Taken together, the [economy][1] is on track to return to its pre-virus
growth rate before the end of the year, he said.

In a report released Tuesday, the Asian Development Bank said the
developing Asia is set to enter its first recession in nearly six
decades as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt global economic
activity.

The region is forecast to shrink 0.7 percent this year. GDP is projected
to rebound 6.8 percent next year.

The lender said the downturn is broad-based but China is an important
exception. China's economy is forecast to grow 1.8 percent in 2020
before surging 7.7 percent next year.
