Switzerland's producer and import prices declined in August, the Federal
Statistical Office reported on Tuesday.

Producer and import prices fell 3.5 percent year-on-year in August.

The producer price index fell 2.2 percent annually in August and import
prices decreased 6.1 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer and import prices fell 0.4 percent in
August.

The latest rise was mainly due to lower prices for chemical and
pharmaceutical products, the agency said.

Domestic sale prices fell 0.8 percent yearly in August and rose 0.1
percent a month ago.
