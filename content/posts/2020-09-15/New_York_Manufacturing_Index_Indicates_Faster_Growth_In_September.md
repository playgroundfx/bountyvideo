A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday
showed a significant acceleration in the pace of growth in regional
manufacturing activity in the month of September.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index jumped
to 17.0 in September from 3.7 in August, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to rise to 6.0.

The sharp increase by the headline index partly reflected a turnaround
by new orders, as the new orders index surged up to a positive 7.1 in
September from a negative 1.7 in August.

The report also showed a notable acceleration in the pace of shipment
growth, with the shipments index climbing to 14.1 in September from 6.7
in August.

The number of employees index also inched up to 2.6 in September from
2.4 in August, indicating modest job growth.

On the inflation front, the prices paid index also jumped to 25.2 in
September from 16.0 in August, while the prices received index rose to
6.5 from 4.7.

The New York Fed also said firms remained optimistic that conditions
would improve over the next six months, with the index for future
business conditions climbing to 40.3 in September from 34.3 in August.

On Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is scheduled to release
its report on regional manufacturing activity. The Philly Fed Index is
expected to dip to 15.0 in September from 17.2 in August.
