Taiwan's consumer price inflation eased more than expected in February,
data released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting &
Statistics revealed on Tuesday.

Consumer prices rose 2.36 percent year-on-year in February, following a
2.84 percent increase in January. Economists had forecast a 2.7 percent
inflation.

Inflation was underpinned by the rise in fuel prices. The indexes for
fuels and lubricants grew 16.88 percent, driven by the rise in the
international oil price.

Excluding fruits, vegetables and energy, core consumer prices rose 1.65
percent in February.

On a monthly basis, the consumer price index rose 0.01 percent, mainly
because of lunar new year holiday effects. The core CPI increased 0.02
percent.

Data showed that the wholesale prices rose 1.81 percent monthly and
gained 11.54 percent annually in February.

The producer price index for domestically produced products grew 1.27
percent monthly and 10.73 percent from a year ago. Pipeline inflation
was led by higher prices for petroleum and coal.
