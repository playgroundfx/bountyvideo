Spain industrial production grew at a slightly faster pace in January
driven by consumer goods output, the statistical office INE said on
Tuesday.

Industrial output climbed by an adjusted 1.7 percent year-on-year in
January, following December's 1.3 percent increase. Nonetheless, this
was weaker than the economists' forecast of +2.3 percent.

On an unadjusted basis, industrial output growth improved to 4.0 percent
from 3.0 percent, data showed.

Within five sectors, four sectors posted positive annual growth rates in
January. Consumer goods output advanced 5.0 percent and intermediate
goods production gained 1.6 percent.

At the same time, energy output grew only 0.2 percent and capital goods
output fell 1.3 percent.

Month-on-month, industrial production slid 0.1 percent in January, but
slower than the 0.5 percent decline logged in December. This was the
second consecutive fall in production.
