Australia [business][1] conditions and sentiment improved in February as
the Omicron virus wave eased and the late 2021 momentum was regained,
survey results from NAB showed on Tuesday.

After a fall in January, the business conditions index rose 7 points to
+9 in February.

The rebound came on the back of a strong rise in the employment index,
reflecting fewer [health][2]-related employment disruptions and strong
labor demand - as well as improvements in trading and profitability.  
  
"After Omicron caused significant disruption to businesses in January,
the latest survey results show things were getting back on track," said
NAB Group Chief Economist Alan Oster.

"That said, the survey for the month was largely completed before the
invasion of Ukraine, so we will have to wait to see how big the impact
of the conflict will be on confidence," said Oster.

The business confidence rose 8 points to +13 in February, building on a
strong rise in January after a sharp fall in December. Confidence rose
across all industries and most states.
