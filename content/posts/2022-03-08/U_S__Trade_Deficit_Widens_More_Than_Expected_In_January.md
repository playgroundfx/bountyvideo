Reflecting a jump in imports and a steep drop in exports, the Commerce
Department released a report on Tuesday showing the U.S. trade deficit
widened by more than expected in the month of January.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $89.7 billion
in January from a revised $82.0 billion in December.

Economists had expected the deficit to climb to $87.1 billion from the
$80.7 billion originally reported for the previous month. With the
bigger than expected increase, the trade deficit reached a new record
high.

The wider trade deficit came as the value of imports jumped by 1.2
percent to $314.1 billion, while the value of exports tumbled by 1.7
percent to $224.4 billion.
