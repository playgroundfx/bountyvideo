Germany's industrial production growth accelerated at the start of the
year ahead of the war in Ukraine, official data revealed Tuesday.

Industrial output advanced 2.7 percent month-on-month, faster than the
revised 1.1 percent increase seen in December, Destatis reported.
Production was forecast to climb at a slower pace of 0.5 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial output grew 1.8 percent, in contrast to
the 2.7 percent decline posted in the previous month.

Compared with February 2020, the month before restrictions were imposed
due to the corona pandemic in Germany, production was 3.0 percent lower
in January.

Excluding energy and construction, industrial production was up by 1.3
percent on month in January.

Within industry, the production of consumer goods expanded 4.0 percent
and capital goods by 1.2 percent. The production of intermediate goods
climbed 0.3 percent.

The mechanical engineering sector made a significant contribution to
industrial production growth, while automotive and automotive parts
posted a noticeable fall.

Energy production decreased 0.1 percent. By contrast, construction
output surged 10.1 percent, thanks to unusually mild weather in January.

The [economy][1] ministry said the economic revival is likely to be
slowed down by the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It is currently uncertain to what extent the resulting bottlenecks in
raw materials and intermediate products will affect production, the
ministry said. This could result in a delay in the processing of the
companies' currently high order backlogs.

The end of Covid restrictions, improving supply chains and filled order
books were the ingredients for such a rebound; only inflation was a
threat, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said. But the war in Ukraine
has changed everything.

Data released on Monday showed that industrial orders grew 1.8 percent
in January underpinned by robust foreign demand and retail sales
advanced 10.3 percent year-on-year, driven by non-food turnover.
