after contracting in the previous quarter, preliminary data from
Statistics South Africa showed Tuesday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.2 percent quarter-on-quarter after a 1.7
percent slump in the previous three months.

spending edged up 0.1 percent. Gross fixed capital formation rose 1.9
percent, while changes in inventories deducted 0.7 percent from total
growth. Exports grew 8.5 percent and imports increased 8.9 percent.

The real GDP increased 4.9 percent in 2021 versus a 6.4 percent fall in
