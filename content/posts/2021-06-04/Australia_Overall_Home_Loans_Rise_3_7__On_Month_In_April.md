The total value of overall home loans in Australia was up a seasonally
adjusted 3.7 percent on month in April, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Friday - standing at A$31.0 billion.

The value of new loan commitments for owner occupier housing reached
another all-time high in April, up 4.3 percent to A$23.0 billion. New
loan commitments for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s rose 2.1 percent to A$8.1 billion, which
was the highest level since mid-2017.

The rise in owner occupier lending was driven by increased loan
commitments for existing dwellings, which rose 9.2 percent. Loan
commitments to owner occupiers for the construction of new dwellings
fell 11.4 percent following a fall of 14.8 percent in March.
