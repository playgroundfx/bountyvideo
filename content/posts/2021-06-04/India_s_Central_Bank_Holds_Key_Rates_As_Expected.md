India's central bank decided to keep its key interest rates unchanged
and to continue with its accommodative stance as long as necessary.

At the end of three-day rate setting meeting, the Monetary Policy
Committee of the Reserve Bank of India unanimously voted to hold the
benchmark [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 4.00 percent. The reverse repo rate was
retained at 3.35 percent.

The Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank Rate were also left
unchanged at 4.25 percent at the meeting.

Also, the committee unanimously decided to continue with accommodative
stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable
basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the
[economy][1], while ensuring that inflation remains within the target
going forward.

The central bank forecast the real GDP to grow 9.5 percent in the
financial year 2021-22. Consumer price inflation inflation was projected
at 5.1 percent during 2021-22.

Governor Shaktikanta Das unveiled additional steps to mitigate the
adverse impact of the second wave of the pandemic. He announced a
