Germany's construction sector contracted further in May largely due to
the supply chain bottlenecks, survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Friday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 44.5 in May from
46.2 in the previous month. This was the lowest reading since February,
when the sector was impacted by a bout of severe wintry weather.

There were marked decreases in activity across both the commercial and
civil engineering categories. Housing activity continued to show a more
resilient trend but was in negative territory.

Several constructors reported taking on less new work in May, linked to
raw material shortages and general capacity constraints. In May, more
companies logged longer lead-times on inputs due to shortages across
supply chains.

Cost inflationary pressures increased further in May with input prices
rising at a record rate for the second month running.

Lower activity levels were reflected in a further decrease in employment
at constructors in May. Staffing levels dropped for the fourth straight
month.

Constructors' expectations for activity over the next 12 months turned
more pessimistic in May, taking them to the lowest overall for five
months.
