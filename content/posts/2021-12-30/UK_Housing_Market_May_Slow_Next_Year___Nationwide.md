The UK housing market may slow next year, after a stellar 2021, with the
end of the stamp duty holiday and the threat posed to the labor market
by the Omicron variant of the [coronavirus][1], the Nationwide Building
Society said Thursday.  
  
The house price index climbed 10.4 percent year-on-year in December
after a 10.0 percent increase in the previous month, the monthly survey
results from the group showed.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the HPI rose 1.0 percent following a 0.9
percent gain in November. Economists had forecast a 0.5 percent
increase.  
  
"2021 was the strongest [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) year for house price growth since
2006," Nationwide said.

The average price of a typical UK home hit a record high of GBP 254,822,
rising nearly GBP 24,000 over the year, which was the largest rise in a
single year in cash [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). Prices were 16 percent higher than before the
Covid-19 pandemic struck in early 2020.

Wales was the strongest performing region this year, while London was
the weakest. The capital was the only UK region to see lower annual
price growth in 2021 than in 2020.

Demand remained strong though the stamp duty holiday ended at the end of
September, and the stock of homes in the market was extremely low
throughout the year, boosting prices.  
  
Nationwide expects the housing market to slow next year as many had
brought forward their housing purchase in view of the stamp duty holiday
to avoid extra tax.  
  
"Even if wider economic conditions remain resilient, higher interest
rates are likely to exert a cooling influence," Nationwide Chief
Economist Robert Gardner said.  
  
Housing affordability is less favorable now than before the pandemic as
house price growth has outpaced income growth by a significant margin
over the past 18 months.  
  
"However, the outlook remains extremely uncertain," Gardner said.  
  
The market still has significant momentum and shifts in housing
preferences as a result of the pandemic could continue to support
activity and price growth, the economist noted.

Gardner expects the Omicron variant to reinforce the shift in
preferences in the near term.
