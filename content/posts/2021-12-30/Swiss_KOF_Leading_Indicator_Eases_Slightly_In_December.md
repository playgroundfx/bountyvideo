A leading indicator of turning points in Switzerland's [economy][1]
eased slightly at the end of the year, survey results showed Thursday.  
  
The KOF Economic Barometer fell to 107 from 107.5 in November, which was
revised from 108.5.  
  
"The Swiss economy should thus continue to develop positively at the
beginning of 2022, if the economic activity is not impaired by the
renewed spread of the virus," the ZÃ¼rich-based think tank said.

The indicator has dropped in every month since it climbed a peak of
143.6 in May. The latest reading was the weakest since February.

In December, the barometer was largely influenced by indicators covering
private consumption, which were slightly negative, the KOF said.

A separate slight negative contribution came from bundles of indicators
from the finance and insurance sector, while indicators for foreign
demand contributed positively.
