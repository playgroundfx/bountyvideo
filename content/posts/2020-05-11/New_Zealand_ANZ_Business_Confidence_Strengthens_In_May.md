New Zealand [business][1] confidence improved strongly in May as the
economy emerges from lockdown, a preliminary business outlook survey
from ANZ showed Tuesday.

The business confidence index surged 21 points to -45.6 in May from
-66.6 in April.  
The 'own activity outlook' index advanced 13 points, still a net 42
percent expects lower activity for their firms in the year ahead.

All forward-looking activity indicators namely export intentions,
investment intentions, capacity utilization, employment intentions and
profit expectations improved from April levels but they remained
extremely weak. At the same time, backward-looking indicators were
deteriorating.

Further, the survey showed that expected costs remained near lows and
pricing intentions were negative. The one-year ahead inflation
expectations dropped to 1.28 percent from 1.46 percent.

The ANZ said reducing [coronavirus][2] cases to negligible levels
sharply reduces a huge downside risk for businesses, but it is clear
that very tough times nonetheless lie ahead.
