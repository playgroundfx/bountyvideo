Lithuania consumer price inflation eased in April, figures from the
statistical office showed on Monday.

The consumer price index rose 1.0 percent year-on-year in April, after a
1.8 percent increase in March.

The latest inflation was mainly driven by higher prices for meat and
meat products, electricity, restaurants, cafes and similar
establishments, waste collection, spirits, tobacco products, and lower
prices for fuels and lubricants, solid fuels and heat energy, the agency
said.

Prices for education grew 7.5 percent annually in April.

Prices for hotels, cafes and restaurants increased by 5.7 percent and
those of [health][1] care, and alcoholic beverages 3.7 percent and 3.4
percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in April, reversing
a 0.1 percent fall in the previous month.
