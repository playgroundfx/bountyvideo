Estonia's trade deficit decreased in March amid a fall in exports and
imports, figures from Statistics Estonia showed on Monday.

The trade deficit fell to EUR 150 million in March from EUR 166 million
in the same month last year. In February, the trade deficit was EUR 130
million.  
  
Exports fell 1.0 percent year-on-year in March, following a 6.0 percent
decrease in February.

Imports decreased 2.0 percent annually in March, the same rate of fall
as seen in the previous month.

In the first quarter, the trade deficit was EUR 300 million compared to
EUR 374 million in the same period last year. Exports and imports fell
3.0 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.

The trade deficit decreased in the first quarter mostly due to declined
exports and imports of electrical equipment and mineral products, the
agency said.

"Imports dropped mainly because less electronic integrated circuits and
passenger cars were imported," Evelin Puura, a leading analyst at
Statistics Estonia said.
