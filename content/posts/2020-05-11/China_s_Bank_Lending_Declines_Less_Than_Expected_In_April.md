China's bank lending declined less than expected in April as the central
bank ramped up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures to support the [economy][1]
that was hit by coronavirus pandemic.

Bank lending decreased to CNY 1.7 trillion from CNY 2.85 trillion in
March, data from the People's Bank of China showed Monday. Nonetheless,
this was above economists' forecast of CNY 1.3 trillion.

The broad measure of money supply, M2 grew at a faster pace of 11.1
percent on a yearly basis, following a 10.1 percent rise in March.

This was the fastest expansion in more than three years. M2 was expected
to climb 10.3 percent in April.

Aggregate financing grew CNY3.09 trillion in April after rising CNY5.15
trillion a month ago.

In the quarterly monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report released by the PBoC over the
weekend, the bank vowed to take strong measures to combat the challenges
posed by the [coronavirus][2] pandemic.

The central bank said it will maintain monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) flexible and keep
liquidity at a reasonable level.

The report skipped the phrase "flood-like" stimulus, indicating that the
bank will inject more funds into the financial system.

Iris Pang, an ING economist expects there will be more focused credit
injections to SMEs, which should help employment. The easing is likely
to be in the form of targeted RRR cuts or broad-based RRR cuts for all
banks.
