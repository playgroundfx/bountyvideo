Some Bank of Japan [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers called for close coordination with
government for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) formulation so as to avoid a Great Depression amid
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, the Summary of Opinions at the Monetary
Policy Meeting, held on April 27, showed Monday.

"Policy authorities must act decisively in order to avoid a second Great
Depression," the summary said. "Close cooperation between fiscal and
monetary authorities in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of their policies is essential at the time
of a significant economic crisis."

Given the current situation where there is concern about deflation,
fiscal and monetary authorities can further cooperate with each other
regarding their policies, members noted.

Some [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said it is desirable to conduct further active
purchases of JGBs and T-Bills, with a view to stabilizing the yield
curve at a low level.

At the April meeting, the bank had expanded its monetary stimulus as it
removed the limit for government bond purchases.

The bank raised the maximum amount of additional purchases of commercial
papers and corporate bonds and lifted the upper limit of outstanding
holdings to about JPY 20 trillion.
