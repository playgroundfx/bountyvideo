The total number of building permits issued in Australia in January
tumbled by a seasonally adjusted 19.4 percent on month, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday - coming in at 15,926.

That was well shy of expectations for a decline of 3.0 percent following
the 12.0 percent drop in December.

Private sector houses fell 12.2 percent on month to 12,124, while
private sector dwellings excluding houses plunged 39.5 percent to 3,434.

On a yearly basis, overall permits were up 19.0 percent, while private
sector houses surged 38.0 percent and dwellings excluding houses sank
22.7 percent.

The value of total building approved fell 16.8 percent, while the value
of non-residential building fell 16.3 percent.
