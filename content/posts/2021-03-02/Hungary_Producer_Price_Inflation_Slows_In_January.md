Hungary's producer price inflation eased in January, figures from the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Tuesday.

The producer price index rose 6.6 percent year-on-year in January, after
a 6.8 percent increase December. In November, prices grew 5.5 percent.

The development of prices was influenced by weakening of the forint
against the euro, the agency said.

Domestic market producer prices gained 3.0 percent in January and
foreign market prices increased by 8.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.7 percent in January.
