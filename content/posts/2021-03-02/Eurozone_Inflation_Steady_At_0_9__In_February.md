Eurozone consumer price inflation was stable in February, while core
price growth slowed, flash figures from Eurostat showed Tuesday.  
  
The consumer price index rose 0.9 percent year-on-year, same as in
January, and in line with economists' expectations. Inflation was in
positive territory for a second straight month.

Core inflation, which excludes prices of energy, food, alcohol &
tobacco, eased to 1.1 percent from 1.4 percent in January. This also
matched economists' expectations.  
  
Compared to the previous month, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in
February, same as in January.

The food, alcohol & tobacco component registered the highest annual rate
of increase in February, 1.4 percent versus 1.5 percent in January.

The rate of increase in services costs slowed to 1.2 percent from 1.4
percent, and that for non-energy industrial goods eased to 1.0 percent
from 1.5 percent.  
  
The pace of decline in energy prices slowed sharply to 1.7 percent from
4.2 percent.  
  
The full data for February is scheduled for release on March 17.  
  
"We expect inflation to temporarily exceed 2 percent later in the year,
but the only worry for the European Central Bank at the moment is higher
bond yields, not higher prices," ING economist Bert Colijn said.

The central bank is likely to see these inflationary drivers as largely
fleeting, but [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are set to express worry over the higher bond
yields that have been driven by developments in the US, the economist
said.  
  
"Because of that, we expect the ECB to increase asset purchases and
address the rising bond yields at next week's meeting," Colijn added.
