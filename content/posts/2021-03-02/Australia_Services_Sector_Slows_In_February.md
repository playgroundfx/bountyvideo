The services sector in Australia continued to expand in February, albeit
at a slightly slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics
showed on Wednesday with a services PMI score of 53.4.

That's down from 55.6 in January, although it remains well above the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, activity and new [business][1] saw sustained gains, while
there was a series-record increase in employment. Business sentiment was
at its strongest in more than two years.

stringent international border restrictions reduced export orders for
the thirteenth month running. That said, the decline was the softest
since last July.

The survey also showed that its composite index fell to 53.7 in February
from 55.9 in January.
