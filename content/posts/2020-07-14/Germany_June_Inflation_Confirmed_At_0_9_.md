German inflation rebounded from a 45-month low in June, latest data from
Destatis confirmed on Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation climbed to 0.9 percent in June from 0.6 percent
in May, which was the lowest since September 2016.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.6 percent in June, after a
0.1 percent fall in May.

Inflation, based on the EU measure of harmonized index of consumer
prices, accelerated to 0.8 percent from 0.5 percent in May.

Compared to the previous month, the HICP gained 0.7 percent after
remaining unchanged in May.

All preliminary estimates released on June 29 were thus confirmed.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, energy prices fell 6.2 percent, which was
slower than the 8.5 percent slump in the previous month, as oil prices
recovered in the global market.  
  
Heating oil prices decreased 26.5 percent and prices of motor fuels fell
15.1 percent. Electricity prices rose 4.1 percent.  
  
Food prices increased 4.4 percent, led by higher prices for fruit and
meat.

Notable price rises were observed for tobacco products as well as
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)papers and periodicals, while price decreases were recorded for
information processing equipment.  
  
Excluding energy product prices, the inflation rate would have been 1.6
percent in June and excluding the prices of energy products and food,
the rate would have been just 1.3 percent.
