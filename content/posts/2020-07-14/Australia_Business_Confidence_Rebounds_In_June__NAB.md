Australia's [business][1] confidence and conditions rebounded in June,
survey data from National Australia Bank showed Tuesday.

The business confidence index rose 21 points to 1 from -20 in May.

Business confidence turned positive after rebounding sharply from record
lows over the past 3 months.

Confidence increased across all sectors except retail in June.
Confidence was positive in all industries excluding retail and
construction. Mining was the most optimistic across industries, while
construction was weakest.

The business conditions index advanced to -7 in June from -24 a month
ago. Nonetheless, conditions remained weak.

The improvement in conditions was driven by significant increases in
trading, profitability and employment sub-components and a broad-based
improvement across industries.

There were improvements in forward orders, capacity utilization and
reported capex also logged an improvement but all remain at low levels.
