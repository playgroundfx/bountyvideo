Partly reflecting a substantial rebound in gasoline prices, the Labor
Department released a report on Tuesday showing a slightly bigger than
expected increase in U.S. consumer prices in the month of June.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index climbed by 0.6
percent in June after edging down by 0.1 percent in May. Economists had
expected consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent.

Excluding higher prices for food and energy, the core consumer price
index ticked up by 0.2 percent in June after slipping by 0.1 percent in
May. Core prices were expected to inch up by 0.1 percent.
