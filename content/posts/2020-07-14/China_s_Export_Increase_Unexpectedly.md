China's exports grew unexpectedly in June as easing of the
[coronavirus][1] containment measures in most of the developed economies
boosted foreign demand, official data showed Tuesday.

In dollar [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports climbed 0.5 percent on a yearly basis in June,
the General Administration of Customs reported. Economists had forecast
an annual fall of 1.5 percent after falling 3.3 percent in May.

Likewise, imports increased 2.7 percent on year, confounding
expectations for a decrease of 10 percent and reversing a 16.7 percent
fall in May.

Consequently, the trade surplus totaled $46.42 billion in June versus a
$62.9 billion surplus posted in May. The expected level was $58.6
billion.

The smaller trade balance confirms the assessment that GDP growth in the
second quarter of 2020 should still be negative on a yearly basis, Iris
Pang, an ING economist said.  
  
The increase in imports added to evidence that domestic demand was
strong at the end of the second quarter, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

Exports also strengthened as slower shipments of products related to
covid-19 were more than offset by strength elsewhere. While exports are
due for a pullback, import growth should remain robust, he noted.

In yuan [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports advanced 4.3 percent and imports gained 6.2
percent annually in June.
