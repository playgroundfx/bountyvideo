The Bank of Japan will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Wednesday
and then announce its decision on interest rates, headlining a modest
day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

The BoJ is widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged
at the record low -0.1 percent, although the central bank may introduce
some kind of additional stimulus.

Australia will see July results for the consumer confidence index from
Westpac Bank; in June, the index climbed 6.3 percent to a score of 93.7.

Indonesia will release June figures for imports, exports and trade
balance. Imports are expected to slide 18.7 percent on year after
plummeting 42.2 percent in May. Exports are called lower by an annual
12.26 percent after dropping 28.95 percent in the previous month. The
trade balance is predicted to show a surplus of $1.11 billion, down from
$2.09 billion a month earlier.

South Korea will see June jobless data; in May, the unemployment rate
came in at 4.5 percent.
