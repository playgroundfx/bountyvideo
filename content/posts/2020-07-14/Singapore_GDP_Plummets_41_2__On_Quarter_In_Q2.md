Singapore's gross domestic product tumbled a seasonally adjusted 41.2
percent on quarter in the second quarter of 2020, the Ministry of Trade
and Industry said in Tuesday's advance estimate.

That missed forecasts for a drop of 37.4 percent following the upwardly
revised 3.3 percent contraction in the previous three months (originally
-4.7 percent).

On a yearly basis, Singapore's GDP sank 12.6 percent - again shy of
expectations for 10.5 percent following the upwardly revised 0.3 percent
fall in the three months prior (originally -0.7 percent).
