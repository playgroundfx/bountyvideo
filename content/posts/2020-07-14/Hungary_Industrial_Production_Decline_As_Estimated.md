Hungary's industrial production declined in May as initially estimated,
final data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on
Tuesday.

Industrial production declined a working-day adjusted 27.6 percent year-
on-year in May, following a 36.6 percent decrease in April, as initially
estimated.

The effects of the economic processes altered by the [coronavirus][1]
epidemic were significant in May, the agency said.

An outstanding fall was observed in the manufacture of transport
equipment, while the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical
products, and food products, beverages and tobacco products declined to
a lesser degree, the agency said.

On a non-adjusted basis, industrial production decreased 30.7 percent
annually in May, as estimated.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production rose 15.6 percent
monthly in May, after a 30.5 percent decrease in the prior month, as
initially estimated.
