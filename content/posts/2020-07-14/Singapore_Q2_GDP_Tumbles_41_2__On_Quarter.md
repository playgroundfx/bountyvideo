Singapore's gross domestic product plummeted a seasonally adjusted
annualized 41.2 percent on quarter in the second quarter of 2020, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry said in Tuesday's advance estimate - with
the fall owing largely to the COVID-19 pandemic.

That missed forecasts for a drop of 37.4 percent following the upwardly
revised 3.3 percent contraction in the previous three months (originally
-4.7 percent).

On a yearly basis, Singapore's GDP sank 12.6 percent - again shy of
expectations for 10.5 percent following the upwardly revised 0.3 percent
fall in the three months prior (originally -0.7 percent).

The manufacturing sector grew 2.5 percent on year in the second quarter,
slower than the 8.2 percent growth in the previous quarter - primarily
due to a surge in output in the biomedical manufacturing cluster. On the
other hand, weak external demand and workplace disruptions weighed on
output in the chemicals, transport engineering and general manufacturing
clusters. On quarter, the manufacturing sector shrank by 23.1 percent, a
sharp reversal from the 45.5 percent expansion in the preceding quarter.

The construction sector contracted 54.7 percent on year, down sharply
from the 1.1 percent fall in the previous quarter. Construction output
weakened, which led to a stoppage of most construction activities during
the period, as well as manpower disruptions arising from additional
measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, including movement restrictions
at foreign worker dormitories. On quarter, the construction sector
shrank by 95.6 percent, far worse than the 12.2 percent contraction in
the preceding quarter.

The services producing industries shed 13.6 percent on year, steeper
than the 2.4 percent decline in the previous quarter. Within services,
tourism-related sectors like accommodation and the air transport sector
were severely affected by global and domestic travel restrictions, which
brought visitor arrivals and air travel to a standstill. Other outward-
oriented services sectors such as wholesale trade and water transport
were adversely affected by a fall in external demand as many countries
around the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic. On quarter, the
services producing industries shrank 37.7 percent, extending the 13.4
percent decline in Q1.
