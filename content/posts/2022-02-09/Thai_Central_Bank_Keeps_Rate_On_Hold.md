Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate on hold, as widely
expected, on Wednesday.

At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting of the Bank of Thailand,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers unanimously voted to hold the key rate at 0.50 percent.

The bank had last reduced the rate by 25 basis points in May 2020.

The economic recovery is set to continue into 2022 driven by higher
merchandise exports, as well as higher number of foreign tourist
arrivals, the bank said. However, the recovery is expected to remain
fragile and uneven across sectors, especially in tourism which was below
pre-pandemic levels.

Headline inflation in 2022 would be higher than previously assessed and
could exceed the target range in the early part of the year reflecting
price increases in energy and raw food products, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said.

Nevertheless, the average inflation rate for the full year 2022 and
medium-term inflation expectations would remain within the target range.

Despite the recent rebound in inflation, interest rates will remain on
hold for some time to come, Gareth Leather, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.
