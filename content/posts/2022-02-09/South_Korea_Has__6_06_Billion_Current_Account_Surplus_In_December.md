South Korea has a current account surplus of $6.06 billion in December,
the Bank of Korea said on Thursday.

That was down from the downwardly revised $6.82 billion surplus in
November (originally $7.16 billion).

The goods account surplus decreased to $4.48 billion, compared to the
$10.60 billion figure in December 2020.

The services account deficit decreased to $0.24 billion, from $0.44
billion in December last year, owing to an improvement in the transport
account.

For all of 2021, the current account surplus was $88.30 billion - up
from $75.90 billion in 2020.
