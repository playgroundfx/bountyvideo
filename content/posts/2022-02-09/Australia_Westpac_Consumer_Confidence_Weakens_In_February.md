Australia consumer confidence weakened in February despite the easing of
restrictions related to the Omicron variant and the labor market
strengthening, data from Westpac showed on Wednesday.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment fell 1.3
percent to 100.8 in February from 102.2 in January.

Among sub-components, the '[economy][1], next 12 months' sub-index grew
2.4 percent and the 'economy, next 5 years' sub-index was up by 1.5
percent.

However, this was more than offset by increased pressure on family
finances. Both components of the Index that measures respondents'
assessments of their finances deteriorated. The 'finances vs. a year
ago' sub-index slumped 9.2 percent and the 'finances, next 12 months'
sub-index declined 1.5 percent.

The 'time to buy a major household item' dropped 0.3 percent from the
previous month.  
  
The Westpac Melbourne Institute Unemployment Expectations Index declined
8.7 percent to 102.8. This was the best score since February 2011.

After falling steadily to be down 9.2 percent over the previous four
months, the Westpac Melbourne Institute Index of House Price
Expectations recovered by 8.7 percent in February.
