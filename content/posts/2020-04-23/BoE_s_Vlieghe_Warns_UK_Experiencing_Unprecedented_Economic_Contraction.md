The UK [economy][1] is undergoing an economic contraction that is the
most severe in centuries due to the coronavirus pandemic and a quick
rebound is unlikely, Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker Gertjan Vlieghe said
Thursday.  
  
"Based on the early indicators, and based on the experience in other
countries that were hit somewhat earlier than the UK, it seems that we
are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than
anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several
centuries," Vlieghe said in a speech.  
  
Coronavirus, or Covid-19, has led to a severe supply shock and a
dramatic reduction in demand at the same time, he pointed out.  
  
"This is therefore a highly asymmetric shock, hitting some sectors in
the economy drastically, while leaving other sectors financially little
affected, and some even positively affected," the rate-setter said.  
  
"...economic downturns always hit different sectors somewhat unevenly,
but the current experience is much more dramatic."

Preliminary survey results from IHS Markit showed on Thursday that the
UK private sector contracted at the fastest pace in more than two
decades in April, due to the widespread shutdowns in response to the
[coronavirus][2].  
  
The manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to a record low and
the corresponding reading for services was the lowest since July 1996.

Elsewhere, survey data from the Confederation of British Industry
revealed that British manufacturers logged the sharpest fall in output
and new orders since 2009 in the three months to April.

Manufacturers expect total new orders to fall to the weakest level on
record in the next quarter, with the balance easing to -78 percent, the
CBI said. Business optimism plunged at a survey-record pace in three
months to April, the survey showed.  
  
"The economy's potential is severely disrupted at the moment but, once
the pandemic is over, and other things equal, in principle it should
return approximately to the pre-virus trajectory," Vlieghe said.

He said a persistent undershoot of the economy relative to its pre-virus
trajectory would most likely be disinflationary.  
  
"So the current priority for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), with a lot of help from
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), is to return the economy to that pre-virus trajectory as
soon as possible," the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker added.
