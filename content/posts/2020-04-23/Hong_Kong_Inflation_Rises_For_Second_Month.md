Hong Kong's consumer price inflation rose for the second straight month
in March, data from the Census and Statistics Department showed on
Thursday.

The consumer price index rose 2.3 percent year-on-year in March,
following a 2.2 percent increase in February. In January, inflation was
1.4 percent.

Excluding the effects of all government's one-off relief measures, core
inflation was 2.6 percent in March, after a 2.5 percent rise in the
previous month.

"The underlying consumer price inflation rate went down from 3.1 percent
for January and February combined to 2.6 percent in March, as food
inflation moderated slightly while price pressures on most other major
CPI components showed varying degrees of easing," the government
spokesman said.

"External price pressures are expected to subside further in view of the
global recession and the recent strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar
along with the US dollar."

"The Government will continue to monitor the inflation situation
closely, particularly the impact on the lower-income people," the
spokesman added.
