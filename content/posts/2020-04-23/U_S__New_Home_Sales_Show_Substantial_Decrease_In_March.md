A report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed a
substantial decrease in new home sales in the U.S. in the month of
March.

The Commerce Department said new home sales plunged by 15.4 percent to
an annual rate of 627,000 in March after tumbling by 4.6 percent to a
revised rate of 741,000 in February.

Economists had expected new home sales to nosedive by 15.7 percent to an
annual rate of 645,000 in March from the 765,000 originally reported for
the previous month.

With the steep drop, new home sales pulled back further off the more

New home sales in the Northeast and West led the way lower, plummeting
by 41.5 percent and 38.5 percent, respectively. Sales in the Midwest
also slumped by 8.1 percent, while sales in the South dipped by 0.8
percent.

The report also said the median sales price of new houses sold in March
was $321,400, down 2.6 percent from $330,100 in February but up 3.5
percent from $310,600 in the same month a year ago.

The Commerce Department said the estimate of new houses for sale at the
end of March was 333,000, representing 6.4 months of supply at the
current sales rate. The months of supply is up from 5.2 months in
February.

On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors released a separate
report showing existing home sales pulled back sharply in the month of
March.

NAR said existing home sales plunged by 8.5 percent to an annual rate of
5.27 million in March after spiking by 6.3 percent to a revised of 5.76
million in February.

rate of 5.30 million from the 5.77 million originally reported for the
previous month.
