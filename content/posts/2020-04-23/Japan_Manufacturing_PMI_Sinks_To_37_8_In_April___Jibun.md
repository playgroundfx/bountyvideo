The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in April, and at
a faster pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on Thursday
with a PMI score of 37.8.

That's down from 41.1 in March and it moves further beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output, new orders, new export orders, employment,
backlogs of work and input prices all declined at a faster rate as a
result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The survey also showed that the services index came in with a score of
22.8 and the composite was at 27.8.
