Singapore's consumer prices stable in March, data from the Monetary
Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed on
Thursday.

The consumer price index remained unchanged in March, after a 0.3
percent increase in February. Economists had expected a 0.3 percent
decrease.

The latest inflation was driven by a decrease in services cost and
private transportation cost.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.2 percent in March, following a 0.1 percent decline in
the preceding month. The fall was attributed to a bigger decline in
costs of services.

The statistical office expects external sources of inflation to remain
benign in the coming quarters, amid low oil prices and weak consumer
demand due to travel restrictions and lockdowns to battle the Covid-19
pandemic.

Supply chain disruptions caused by Covid-19 could push up the prices on
imported food prices.  
  
Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average between -1 percent and 0 percent in 2020, the statistical office
and MAS said.
