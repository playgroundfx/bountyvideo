The German private sector shrank the most on record in April as both
services and manufacturing recorded decreases in output due to the
COVID-19 lockdown, flash survey results from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The headline flash composite output index declined to 17.1 in April from
35.0 in March. This was the lowest reading since comparable data were
first compiled more than 22 years ago.

The score was forecast to drop moderately to 28.8.

"April's PMI surveys reveal the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
and subsequent lockdown on Germany's [economy][1], showing [business][2]
activity across manufacturing and services falling at a rate unlike
anything that has come before," Phil Smith, a principal economist at IHS
Markit said.

The flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell sharply to a
133-month low of 34.4 from 45.4 in March. The expected reading was 39.0.

The services PMI reached a record low of 15.9 versus 31.7 a month ago
and forecast of 28.1.
