France's manufacturing confidence deteriorated at the fastest pace since
the survey began in 1975, due to the general lockdown to curb the spread
of COVID-19, survey results from the statistical office Insee showed
Thursday.  
  
The manufacturing sentiment index fell to 82 in April from 98 in March.
The reading was below its long-term average of 100 and the expected
score of 83.0.

The index lost 16 points in April, a drop not seen since the beginning
of the indicator in 1975, in relation with the [health][1] crisis.

Industrialists opinion on own production prospects collapsed below its
former lowest level seen in 2009. The corresponding index slid to -35
from -7 in March.

Their general production expectations also deteriorated sharply, with
the index falling to -78 from -33 in March.

The balances of opinion on past activity and order books, total and
foreign, significantly declined, back to the low values of 2013, the
survey showed.

Regarding employment, the balance of opinion on past variation dipped to
-8 from -3 and the one on expected variation slumped to -19 from -5.  
  
The overall [business][2] confidence declined to 62 in April, the lowest
since the start of the series, from 94 in March. The previous lowest
score was 69, which was reached in March 2009.
