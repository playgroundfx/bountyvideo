Australia's exports surged in March driven by shipment of iron ore to
China and gold to Hong Kong and the UK, preliminary data published by
the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday.

Exports increased 29 percent, or A$8 billion in March. The detailed
results will be published on May 7.

After falling in January and February, exports of iron ore to China,
Australia's largest trading partner, increased significantly in March.

The ABS said there were also large increases in the value of exports of
coal, gas and petroleum, and strong exports of non-monetary gold,
particularly to Hong Kong and the UK.

At the same time, imports advanced 10 percent on month in March, due to
increases in the value of imports of non-monetary gold, aircraft and
consumer electronics such as laptop computers and mobile phones.
