The UK private sector contracted at the fastest pace in more than two
decades due to the widespread shutdowns in response to the
[coronavirus][1], or COVID-19, pandemic, flash survey results from the
IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply composite
output index fell to a record low 12.9 in April from 36.0 in March. This
was well below economists' forecast of 31.0.

The latest survey also signaled survey-record declines in new orders,
backlogs of work and employment in April. Meanwhile, [business][2]
sentiment showed a moderate rebound from the record low seen in March.

Average prices charged decreased at the steepest pace since this index
began in November 1999. At the same time, average cost burdens dropped
for the first time in just over five years.

At 32.9, the flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index reached its
lowest score since the survey began in January 1992, from 47.8 in March.
The expected score was 42.0.

At the same time, the services PMI plummeted to 12.3 in April from 34.5
in March, to signal by far the sharpest reduction in service sector
activity since the survey began in July 1996. The reading was forecast
to drop to 29.0.

Simple [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) comparisons of the PMI with GDP indicate that the
April survey reading is consistent with GDP falling at a quarterly rate
of approximately 7 percent, Chris Williamson, chief business economist
at IHS Markit, said.

However, the actual fall in GDP could be even greater, in part because
the PMI excludes the vast majority of the self-employed and the retail
sector, which have been especially hard-hit by the COVID-19 containment
measures, Williamson noted.  
  
The more important concern now is the recovery, and despite bold
economic measures from the government and Bank of England, the recovery
is set to be a slow process, James Smith, an ING economist said.

Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK budget
deficit exceeded the government estimate in the financial year ended
March 2020.

Public sector net borrowing increased GBP 9.3 billion from the last year
to GBP 48.7 in the financial year ended March. This was above the GBP
47.4 billion borrowing projected by the Office for Budget
Responsibility.

Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks rose GBP 3.9
billion to GBP 3.1 billion in March. This was the highest borrowing in
any March since 2016.

The ONS cautioned that the coronavirus, or COVID-19 pandemic is expected
to have a significant impact on the UK public sector finances.
Accordingly, some of the statistics included in this release will
undergo larger revisions than normal.
