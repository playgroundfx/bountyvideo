Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence eased to the lowest since last April as
tighter lockdown measures weighed on current assessment, survey data
from the behavioral research institute Sentix showed on Monday.

The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index fell to 13.5 in December from 18.3 in the
previous month. This was the lowest score since April 2021 and below the
expected level of 15.9.

The lockdown measures taken above all in Germany and Austria put a
considerable damper on current economic activity.

The current situation index came in at 13.3 in December, the lowest
since May 2021, and down from 23.5 a month ago. Meanwhile, the
expectations indicator rose to 13.8 from 13.3 in the prior month.

"Our basic scenario of a "mid-cycle slowdown", i.e. a consolidation in
the middle of a cycle, does not have to be abandoned yet," Sentix said.

In Germany, the Sentix overall index slumped again and fell to its
lowest value since March 2021. The corresponding indicator came in at
14.4, down from 19.7 in the previous month. This was the fifth decline
in a row.

A "technical" recession seems possible, but should not be taken lightly,
the agency said. Investors' expectations remained stable.

The current situation indicator plunged to 13.8 in December from 24.8 in
the prior month. On the other hand, the expectations index rose slightly
to 15.0 from 14.8.
