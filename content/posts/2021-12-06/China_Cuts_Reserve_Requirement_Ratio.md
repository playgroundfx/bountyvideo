China's central bank lowered its reserve requirement ratio for the
second time this year in order to support growth that is widely expected
to weaken at the end of the year.

The People's Bank of China decided to cut the RRR for major commercial
banks by 50 basis points. The reduction will take effect on December 15.

The current cut in reserve requirement ratio is set to release CNY 1.2
trillion in long-term liquidity.

The latest PBoC announcement came after Premier Li Keqiang last week
said the central bank will reduce the RRR in a timely way.

The bank had reduced the RRR by 0.5 percentage points in July.

The latest RRR cut will have only a small economic impact, Julian Evans-
Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said. However, it will
form part of a wider effort to push down interest rates.

The economist expects [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate cuts before long, but said that there
still appears to be little appetite at the central bank for a sharp
rebound in credit growth.

This RRR cut gives a signal to the market that the government has turned
from aggressive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions in the second half of this year to
stabilizing the [economy][1] in 2022, Iris Pang, an economist at ING,
said.

ING expects the RRR cut to boost fixed asset investment in
infrastructure, transportation and telecommunications in 2022, and this
would be the main engine of economic growth.
