UK car registrations increased for the first time in five months in
November, data released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, or SMMT, showed on Monday.

New car registrations grew 1.7 percent from last year in November. Sales
totaled 115,706 units.

The lobby cautioned that this data must be viewed in the context of a
weak 2020, when lockdowns impacted registrations, including November.

Data showed that sales of battery electric vehicles surged 110 percent
annually. Meanwhile, sales of diesel and petrol vehicles plunged 62.7
percent and 10.4 percent, respectively.

Compared to the pre-pandemic average, the market remained down
significantly, with -31.3 percent fewer vehicles registered in September
as semiconductor shortages constrained supply.

Year-to-date, 1,53 million new cars have been registered, of which 17.5
percent have been BEVs or PHEVs, meaning one in six new cars is capable
of being plugged in.

"The continued acceleration of electrified vehicle registrations is good
for the industry, the consumer and the environment but, with the pace of
public charging infrastructure struggling to keep up, we need swift
action and binding public charger targets so that everyone can be part
of the electric vehicle revolution, irrespective of where they live,
Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive," said.
