The average of household spending in Japan was down 0.6 percent on year
in October, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Tuesday - coming in at 281,996 yen.

That was in line with expectations following the 1.9 percent annual drop
in September.

On a monthly basis, household spending improved 3.4 percent - shy of
forecasts for an increase of 3.6 percent and down from 5.0 percent in
the previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 549,269 yen, up 0.4
percent on year.
