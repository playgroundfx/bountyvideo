A measure signaling turning points in Switzerland's [economy][1] rose
above its long-term average in February, suggesting economic activity is
set to pick up in the months ahead.

The Economic Barometer rose to 102.7 points in February, which is
slightly above its long-?term average of 100, from 96.5 in January, the
think tank KOF said Friday. Economists had expected a modest increase to
96.6.

The KOF attributed the strong increase mainly to the improvement in the
service sector indicators.

"Slightly negative signals are coming from the indicators relating to
foreign demand," KOF said.

"The prospects for the other economic activities recorded in the
barometer have hardly changed compared to January."
