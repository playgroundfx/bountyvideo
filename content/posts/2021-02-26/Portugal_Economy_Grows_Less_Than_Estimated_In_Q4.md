Portugal's [economy][1] grew less than estimated in the final three
months of 2020, amid a resurgence in the coronavirus infections across
Europe.  
  
Gross domestic product increased 0.2 percent from the third quarter,
when the economy expanded grew 13.3 percent, revised data from
Statistics Portugal showed Friday. The fourth quarter growth was earlier
estimated at 0.4 percent.  
  
In the first and second quarters, output decreased 4.0 and 13.9 percent,
respectively.

Growth in the fourth quarter was largely driven by domestic demand, the
agency said.  
  
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, the economy shrank 6.1 percent,
which was much severe than the initially estimated 5.9 percent. In the
third quarter, the economy contracted 5.7 percent. The annual shrinkage
was the fourth in a row.

For the full year 2020, GDP decreased a record 7.6 percent after a
revised 2.5 percent growth in 2019.  
  
Domestic demand made a significant negative contribution to the annual
rate of change of GDP, mainly due to the decrease of private
consumption. Steep falls in exports and imports of both goods and
services made the contribution of net external demand was more negative
in 2020. In particular, tourism exports had an unprecedented reduction.
