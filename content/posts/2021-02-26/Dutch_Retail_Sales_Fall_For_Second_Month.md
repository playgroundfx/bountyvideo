Dutch retail sales declined for the second straight month in January,
data published by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed Friday.

Retail turnover declined 5.9 percent yearly in January, following a 3.2
percent fall in December.

Turnover in food stores grew 8.6 percent yearly in January, while non-
food stores decreased 37.7 percent. Online turnover surged 92.1 percent.

Sales in the non-food sector declined due to the measures taken against
the spread of the corona virus, the agency said.

On an unadjusted basis, retail turnover declined 7.8 percent in January.
