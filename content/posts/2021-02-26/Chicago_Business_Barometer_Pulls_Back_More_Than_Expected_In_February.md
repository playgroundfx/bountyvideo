MNI Indicators released a report on Friday showing a bigger than
expected slowdown in the pace of growth in Chicago-area [business][1]
activity in the month of February.

The report said MNI Indicators' Chicago business barometer dropped to
59.5 in February after jumping to a more than two-year high of 63.8 in
January.

While a reading above 50 still indicates growth in Chicago-area business
activity, economists had expected the index to show a more modest
decrease to 61.1.

The bigger than expected drop by the business barometer came as the new
orders index tumbled by 11 points to its lowest level since last August.
The production index also slumped by 9.3 points.

MNI Indicators said anecdotal evidence painted a mixed picture, with
some firms experiencing a downturn due to the [coronavirus][2] pandemic,
while others report strong consumer demand.

Meanwhile, the report said the employment index jumped by 5.7 points to
a sixteen-month high but remained in contraction territory.

The prices paid index also inched up by 0.1 points, reaching the highest
level since September of 2018, as companies again noted increase in
price for raw materials, especially tin.

MNI Indicators said 87.2 percent of respondents were undecided when
asked if their organization would require their workforce and contingent
labor to be vaccinated for the coronavirus.
