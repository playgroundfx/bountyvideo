Revised data released by the University of Michigan on Friday showed
U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated by slightly less than initially
estimated in the month of February.

The report showed the consumer sentiment index for February was upwardly
revised to 76.8 from the initial estimate of 76.2.

The revised reading came in above economist estimates of 76.5 but was
still below the final January reading of 79.0.

"All of February's loss was due to households with incomes below
$75,000, with the declines mainly concentrated in future economic
prospects," said Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin.

He added, "The worst of the pandemic may be nearing its end, but few
consumers anticipate the type of persistent and robust economic growth
that restores employment conditions to the very positive pre-pandemic
levels."

The report showed the index of consumer expectations slid to 70.7 in
February from 74.0 in January, while the current economic conditions
index edged down to 86.2 from 86.7.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expected jumped to 3.3
percent in February from 3.0 percent in January. Five-year inflation
expectations were unchanged at 2.7 percent.

"While consumers clearly anticipate a spurt in inflation in the year
ahead, the overall evidence does not indicate the emergence of an
inflationary psychology that makes the expectation of inflation a self-
fulfilling prophecy," Curtin said.

Meanwhile, a report released by the Conference Board on Tuesday showed
consumer confidence in the U.S. improved more than expected in the month
of February.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 91.3 in
February from a downwardly revised 88.9 in January.

Economists had expected the consumer confidence index to inch up to 90.0
from the 89.3 originally reported for the previous month.
