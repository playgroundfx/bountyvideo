Switzerland's economic growth eased sharply in the fourth quarter as the
restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic dampened the service
sector activity, especially tourism.

Gross domestic product gained 0.3 percent sequentially, much slower than
the 7.6 percent expansion seen in the third quarter, the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, said Friday. GDP was forecast
to climb 0.1 percent.

Tighter virus-related restrictions and a renewed slump in the
neighboring Eurozone means that activity is likely to remain weak in the
first quarter, Melanie Debono, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

But as elsewhere, the [economy][1] is clearly holding up much better
than during the first lockdown, the economist added.

On a yearly basis, GDP dropped 1.6 percent, following a 1.4 percent
decrease in the third quarter. However, this was slower than the 2.1
percent decrease economists' had forecast.

The second wave of the [coronavirus][2] until the end of 2020 had much
less of an impact on the economy than the first wave did last spring,
the agency said.

Data showed that major losses were reported in the services directly
affected by the tightening of the containment measures, while other
industries continued to recover.

Value added in accommodation and food services plunged 20.8 percent, as
well as in arts, [entertainment][3] and recreation by 7.7 percent.
Meanwhile, manufacturing and construction grew 1.4 percent and 0.4
percent, respectively.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that private consumption decreased
1.5 percent, while government spending grew 2.3 percent.

Equipment and software investment was up 1.9 percent and construction
investment gained 0.1 percent.

Exports of goods decreased 1 percent, while services exports rose 0.4
percent. At the same time, imports of goods and services slid 0.4
percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.

The survey data from the KOF Swiss Economic Institute showed that
economic activity will be more lively for the next few months. The
indicator rose to 102.7 in February from 96.5 in January. The expected
reading was 96.6.
