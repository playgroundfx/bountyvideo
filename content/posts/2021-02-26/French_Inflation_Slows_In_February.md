French consumer price inflation slowed in February reflecting the
downturn in manufactured goods prices and the slowdown in services
prices, the provisional estimate from the statistical office Insee
showed on Friday.

In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said household spending
decreased sharply in January due to a notable fall in the consumption of
manufactured goods.  
  
Consumer prices gained 0.4 percent year-on-year in February, slower than
the 0.6 percent rise in January. In the same period last year, inflation
was 1.4 percent. Economists had forecast an annual rate of 0.3 percent.

Food prices and services cost grew at slower rates of 0.8 percent and
0.7 percent, respectively. At the same time, manufactured product prices
were down 0.5 percent.

Month-on-month, consumer prices dropped 0.1 percent after a 0.2 percent
rise in January. The decrease in manufactured goods prices accentuated
due to the two-week extension of the winter sales, Insee said.

Year-on-year, the harmonized index of consumer prices advanced 0.7
percent after a 0.8 percent rise in January. The index was forecast to
rise 0.5 percent.

Month-on-month, the HICP remained stable after +0.3 percent gain in the
previous month.

Another report from Insee showed that producer prices in domestic market
advanced 0.4 percent on year in January, breaking the drops observed
from February to December 2020. Prices had decreased 1 percent in
December. Month-on-month, producer prices climbed 1.2 percent after a
1.1 percent rise a month ago.  
  
Household spending was down 4.6 percent, in contrast to the 22.4 percent
rebound in December. Spending was forecast to drop 3.5 percent.
