Finland's economic expansion slowed less than estimated but sharply, in
the fourth quarter of 2020, amid a resurgence in the [coronavirus][1]
infections across Europe.

Gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter, preliminary
data from Statistics Finland showed Tuesday. The agency had estimated
fourth quarter growth at 0.2 percent on February 16.

The third quarter growth was revised to 3.2 percent from 3.3 percent.

The [economy][2] grew for a second consecutive quarter after a massive
4.3 percent, revised from 3.9 percent, output decline in the second
quarter and a revised 0.9 percent fall in the first three months of the
year.

Compared to the previous quarter, exports rose 8.8 percent, while
imports fell 1.4 percent. Investments decreased 1.9 percent and private
consumption shrunk 1.5 percent. Public expenditure grew 2.8 percent.

The year-on-year working-day adjusted GDP decline was 1.4 percent, which
was less than the initially estimated 2.0 percent fall. The annual fall
for the third quarter was revised to 2.6 percent from 2.7 percent.

For the whole year 2020, during which activity was hurt severely by the
coronavirus pandemic and the consequent restrictions, GDP decreased 2.9
percent. In 2019, the economy grew 1.3 percent.
