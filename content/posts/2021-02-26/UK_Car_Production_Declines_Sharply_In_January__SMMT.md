UK car production declined sharply in January largely due to the ongoing
effects of the pandemic, extended shutdowns and global supply chain
issues along with friction in the new trading arrangements following the
end of the Brexit transition period, data released by the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, or SMMT, showed on Friday.

Car production decreased 27.3 percent on a yearly basis to 86,052 units
in January. With a fall of 32,262, this was the worst January
performance since 2009, and a 17th consecutive month of decline.

Production for both domestic and overseas [markets][1] decreased, to
16,692 and 69,360 units respectively, representing falls of -18.3
percent and -29.1 percent. Shipments to major markets the EU, US and
Asia all fell by double digits.

Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said, "Yet another month of decline
for UK car production is a grave concern and next week's Budget is the
Chancellor's opportunity to boost the industry by introducing measures
that will support competitiveness, jobs and livelihoods."
