Sweden's manufacturing expansion eased in December, yet remained robust,
survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on
Monday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector fell to 62.1
in December from a revised 63.1 in November. A PMI reading above 50
suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

"Although the growth rate in the industry has slowed in recent months,
it is still a robust and resilient industrial [economy][1] that is
emerging despite supply disruptions and increased uncertainty about the
spread of Omicron and its effects on the economy," Swedbank analyst
Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-indices, order intake, inventories and delivery time
declined in December.

Suppliers' raw materials and intermediate goods prices declined for the
second straight month.
