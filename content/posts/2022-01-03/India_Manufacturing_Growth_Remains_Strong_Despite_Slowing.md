India's manufacturing sector growth eased in December, but the pace of
expansion remained robust amid substantial, albeit slower, gains in
sales and output, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 55.5 in December
from 57.6 in November. A score above 50.0 indicates expansion.

The quarterly reading was 56.3, the highest score since the final
quarter of fiscal year 2020/21.

New orders increased further in December and production rose at a sharp
pace.

The rate of inflation eased to the lowest in three months in December
and output charges increased, with the overall rate of inflation being
the weakest since October 2020.

The overall degree of optimism remained below its long-run average.

Employment declined in December and input inventories expanded. Lead
time increased and new export orders rose for the sixth straight month.

"The last PMI results of 2021 for the Indian manufacturing sector were
encouraging, with the economic recovery continuing as firms were
successful in securing new work from domestic and international
sources," Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit,
said.
