The manufacturing sector in the Philippines continued to expand in
December, and at a slightly faster pace, the latest survey from Markit
Economics revealed on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.8.

That's up from 51.7 in November and it moved further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Although only modest, the latest uptick was the strongest in nine
months, and broadly in line with the long-run series average.

The improvement was partly driven by a quicker rise in new orders
received by Filipino manufacturers. The overall rate of growth was
modest with panel members continuing to highlight favorable domestic
demand conditions. Contrary to the trend seen for total sales, new
export orders fell sharply and at the quickest rate for four months.
Tighter restrictions in international [markets][1], linked to the
Omicron variant, led to the downfall.
