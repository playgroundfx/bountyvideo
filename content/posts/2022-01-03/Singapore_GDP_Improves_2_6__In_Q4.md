Singapore's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 2.6
percent on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Ministry of Trade
and Industry said on Monday.

That beat expectations for an increase of 2.0 percent on quarter
following the 1.2 percent increase in the previous three months.

On an annualized yearly basis, GDP jumped 5.9 percent - also exceeding
forecasts for a gain of 5.4 percent and slowing from 7.1 percent in the
third quarter.

For all of 2021, GDP jumped 7.2 percent after shrinking 5.4 percent in
2020.
