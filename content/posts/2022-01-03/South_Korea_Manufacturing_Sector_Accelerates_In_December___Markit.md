The manufacturing sector in South Korea continued to expand in December,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.9.

That's up from 50.9 and it moved further above the boom-or-bust line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New orders - which has the largest weighting in the PMI - increased
during December at the fastest rate in three months, reportedly
reflecting rising sales at domestic clients. However, the overall
expansion was subdued by comparison to those seen in the first half of
2021.

Relatively weak new order growth came amid the first month-on-month drop
in new export orders since September 2020. Rising COVID-19 infections
globally, poor shipping container availability and reduced demand from
clients in Japan were reportedly behind the decrease.
