The euro area private sector grew at the fastest pace in 15 years in
June driven by the improvement across manufacturing and services sectors
amid the easing of the COVID-19 containment measures, final data from
IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The composite output index rose to 59.5 in June from 57.1 in May. The
reading was also above the flash 59.2.

June marked not only the fourth successive month that the index has
posted above the 50.0 no-change mark, but the highest index level since
June 2006.  
  
The services Purchasing Managers' Index logged 58.3 in June, up from
55.2 in the previous month and the flash 58.0. The latest reading was
also the highest since July 2007.

The PMI surveys suggest the region's [economy][1] is firing on all
cylinders as it heads into the summer, Chris Williamson, chief
[business][2] economist at IHS Markit said.

Among big-four nations, Spain's private sector grew the most since
February 2000 and Germany posted the biggest growth for over a decade.
Italy and France both registered their best performances for nearly
three-and-a-half years.

The Germany's composite output index rose to a decade-high of 60.1 in
June from May's 56.2, signaling a pick-up in the pace of recovery of the
private sector as the second quarter came to a close. The flash score
was 60.4.

The services PMI rose sharply to 57.5 in June, the highest since March
2011, from 52.8 in May. However, the reading was below the flash 58.1.

France's private sector completed the first quarter of uninterrupted
growth since late-2019. The private sector expanded the most in just
under three-and-a-half years in June.

The composite output index came in at 57.4 in June versus 57.0 in May.
The preliminary score was 57.1. At the same time, the services PMI
advanced to 57.8 from 56.6 in May and also above the flash 57.4.

Italy's private sector logged its fastest upturn since January 2018. The
composite output index improved to 58.3 from 55.7 in the previous month.
The services PMI climbed to 56.7 from 53.1 in May. The expected level
was 56.0.

Spain's private sector activity continued to increase in June, rising
for a fourth successive month and to the strongest degree seen since
February 2000.

Spain's composite indicator climbed to 62.4 in June from 59.2 in May.
Growth rates were similarly sharp across both the manufacturing and
service sectors. The services PMI improved to 62.5 from 59.4 a month
ago.
