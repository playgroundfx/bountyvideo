Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector growth continued at a steady pace
in June, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index remained unchanged at 56.4 in June. Any
reading above 50 indicates growth in the sector.

New orders increased at the fastest pace in five months in June, while
output declined for the first time since March.

New [business][1] inflows continued to rise in June and input buying was
the quickest in twenty-one months.

The number of workforce rose in June and the rate of job creation was
the fastest since November 2019.

Input price inflation eased for the first time this year and output
charges rose at a softer pace in June.

"This may be attributed to the relative strength of domestic supply
chains, which have not yet been affected by global supply difficulties,"
David Owen, an economist at IHS Markit, said.

Business confidence improved to the highest in five months amid
expectations of relaxation of Covid-19 measures.
