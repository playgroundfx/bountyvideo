India's service sector contracted sharply in June as the emergence of
the pandemic and the reintroduction of containment measures restricted
demand, survey data from IHS Markit revealed on Monday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell unexpectedly to 41.2 in
June from 46.4 in May. Economists had forecast the index to rise to
48.0.

A reading below 50.0 indicates contraction in the sector. The index
signaled the fastest pace of contraction in activity since July 2020.  
  
Subdued demand conditions resulted in a second successive monthly drop
in new [business][1] received by services firms. Foreign demand
deteriorated further in June, with new export orders falling for the
sixteenth consecutive month.  
  
In line with falling demand, companies reduced payroll numbers in June.

On the price front, the survey showed that higher transportation and
material costs continued to push-up average input prices. But the pace
of inflation was at a five-month low. Services companies continued to
share rising cost burdens with clients by lifting their selling prices
in June.

Services firms were neutral in their expectations for output in the
coming 12 months. The overall level of business sentiment was down for
the third month in a row in June, reaching its lowest mark since last
August.

The overall private sector [economy][2] shrank at the sharpest rate
since July 2020. The composite output index fell to 43.1 in June from
48.1 in May.
