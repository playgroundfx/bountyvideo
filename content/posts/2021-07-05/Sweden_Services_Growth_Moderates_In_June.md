Sweden's services sector activity expanded at a softer pace in June,
survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on
Monday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector fell to 67.4 in
June from a revised 71.3 in May.

The latest reading was the third highest in the fifteen-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of
the survey. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

"This shows that the service [economy][1] is in a strong expansive phase
and that may receive additional support during the third quarter now
that the corona restrictions are being withdrawn," Swedbank analyst
Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the four sub-indices, three declined in June. Order intake and
employment declined, and suppliers' delivery time lengthened.

Price pressures increased further in June and supplier's input goods
rose to a record high.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, decreased
to 66.9 in June from 69.8 in the previous month.

"This is the second highest level in the index's [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and means that
Swedish [business][2] and industry will continue to expand at a rapid
pace, even though increased production costs and supply shortages mean
challenges in the long run," Kennemar said.
