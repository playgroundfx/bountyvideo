Eurozone's [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence improved for a fifth month in a row in
July to its highest level in nearly three-and-a-half years amid the
rebound in economic activity as economies re-open after restrictions
linked to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic were relaxed.  
  
The eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index rose to 29.8 from 28.1 in June,
survey data from the think tank Sentix showed Monday. Economists had
forecast a score of 30.0.  
  
The latest reading was the highest since February 2018.  
  
The survey was conducted from July 1 to July 3 among 1,114 [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.  
  
The current situation index of the survey also rose for a fifth straight
month. The reading climbed to 29.8, its highest level since October
2018.  
  
Meanwhile, the expectations index fell to 29.8 from 35.3. The latest
score was the weakest since December 2020.  
  
"We are approaching a certain point of "maximum momentum" in the short
term," Sentix said.  
  
"For the [economy][2] as a whole, this is not yet a worrying decline,"
the institute added.  
  
However, the equity [markets][3], which are very much focused on
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) expectations, could see increased volatility due to this
development, Sentix said.

The institute pointed out that when similar phases occurred in 2006 and
2010, interim stock market corrections of around 10 percent followed.

Further, Sentix said there is no sign of a turn away from the expansive
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) from the ECB.  
  
That said, the institute drew attention to the inflation barometer that
remains clearly in negative territory at -38.25, underscoring the danger
of further rising inflation rates in a globally increasingly
synchronized, strong economic upswing.

The survey also showed that the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index for Germany
also increased for a fifth month in a row to its highest level since
February 2018. The situation index rose for a fourteenth straight month,
while the expectations measure weakened to an eight-month low.
