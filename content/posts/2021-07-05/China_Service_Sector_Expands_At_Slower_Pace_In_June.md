China's service sector expanded at a much slower pace in June as the
recent uptick in COVID-19 cases and reduced travel dampened overall new
[business][1], survey results published by IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index fell notably to 50.3 in
June from 55.1 in May. Nonetheless, the index has remained above the
neutral 50 mark for the fourteenth successive month.  
  
The slower upturn in business activity coincided with a softer increase
in overall new work. New work from abroad meanwhile increased only
marginally.

Employment across the service sector fell for the first time in four
months.

On the price front, the survey showed that input price inflation eased
to the lowest since September 2020. Services companies lowered their
average output charges for the first time in nearly a year in June.

Although services companies remained strongly upbeat regarding the year-
ahead outlook for activity, the resurgence of the COVID-19 virus
dampened overall optimism in June. Moreover, the degree of positive
sentiment slipped to a nine-month low.

The composite output index that measures the overall performance of
manufacturing and services, slipped to 50.6 in June from 53.8 in May.
The rate of growth was the softest seen in the current 14-month period
of expansion and only marginal.
