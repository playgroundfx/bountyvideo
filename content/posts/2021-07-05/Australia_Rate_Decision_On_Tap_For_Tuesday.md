The Reserve Bank of Australia will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
on Tuesday and then announce its decision on interest rates,
highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The RBA is
widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate steady at 0.1
percent.

Australia also will see June results for the inflation forecast from TD
Securities and the Melbourne Institute. In May, the forecast called for
a decline of 0.2 percent on month.

Japan will release May figures for household spending, with forecasts
suggesting a decline of 3.7 percent on month and a gain of 10.9 percent
on year. That follows the 0.1 percent monthly increase and the 13.0
percent annual spike in April.

Taiwan will see unemployment numbers for May; in April, the jobless rate
was 3.71 percent.

Hong Kong will see June results for the private sector PMI from Markit
Economics; in May, the PMI score was 52.5.

The Philippines will provide April numbers for retail prices and June
figures for consumer prices. In March, retail prices were up 1.8 percent
on year. In May, overall inflation was up 0.1 percent on month and 4.5
percent on year, while core CPI rose 3.3 percent on year.
