The average of household spending in Japan was up 11.6 percent on year
in May, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Tuesday - coming in at 281,063 yen.

That beat forecasts for an increase of 10.9 percent following the 13.0
percent spike in April.

On a monthly basis, household spending was down 2.1 percent - but that
beat expectations for a decline of 3.7 percent following the 0.1 percent
gain in the previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 489,019 yen, down
2.6 percent on year.
