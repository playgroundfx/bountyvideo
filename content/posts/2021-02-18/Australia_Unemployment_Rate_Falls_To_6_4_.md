The jobless rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 6.4
percent in January, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on
Thursday.

That was beneath expectations for 6.5 percent and down from 6.6 percent
in December.

The Australian [economy][1] added 29,100 jobs last month - shy of
forecasts for 40,000 new jobs after gaining 50,000 jobs in the previous
month.

The participation rate came in at 66.1 percent, missing expectations for
66.2 percent - which would have been unchanged from the December
reading.
