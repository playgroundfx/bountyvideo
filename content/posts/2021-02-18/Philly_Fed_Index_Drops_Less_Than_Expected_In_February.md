Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity saw continued growth in the
month of February, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday, although the pace of growth slowed
from the previous month.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity dipped to
23.1 in February from 26.5, but a positive reading still indicates
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to drop to 20.0.

Looking ahead, the report said most future indexes moderated this month
but continue to indicate that firms expect growth over the next six
months.
