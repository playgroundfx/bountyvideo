Belgium's consumer confidence rose slightly in February after, partly
reversing January's fall, as households were more positive regarding the
job market.  
  
The consumer confidence index climbed to -9 from -10 in January, survey
data from the National Bank of Belgium showed Thursday.  
  
Consumers were clearly more optimistic regarding the job market over the
next months. The 12-month unemployment expectations index eased to 48
from 54.  
  
Households were also less pessimistic regarding the macroeconomic
situation over the next 12 months and the relevant index rose to -4 from
-5.  
  
The personal financial expectations index eased to 2 from 4. The saving
expectations index dropped to 13 from 17.
