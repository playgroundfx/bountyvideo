European Central Bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers continued to assess that there was a
case for maintaining ample stimulus and stressed that measures that were
put in place in December should be given time to take full effect, the
minutes of the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting showed Thursday.

"Members agreed that ample monetary stimulus remained essential to
preserve favorable financing conditions over the pandemic period," the
minutes of the meeting, which the ECB calls 'account', said.

During the January 20-21 meeting, an argument was put forward that
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should keep a steady hand. Rate-setters also agreed that
that there was no room for complacency though there were signs of
recovery gaining speed on roll-out of vaccinations against the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.  
  
That said, it was argued that the fast rebound in growth foreseen in the
December staff projections might be too optimistic, with Eurozone growth
in the second quarter of 2021 possibly at risk from extended lockdowns.

The euro exchange rate remained a worry for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers, the minutes
showed.  
  
"Concerns were voiced...over developments in the exchange rate that
might have negative implications for euro area financial conditions and,
ultimately, consequences for the inflation outlook," the minutes said.  
  
The view that nominal yields were not an appropriate benchmark for
assessing whether financing conditions remained favourable was
reconfirmed. Nominal yields could rise because of a better economic
outlook and higher inflation expectations, the bank noted.  
  
Further, members agreed that not every increase in nominal yields should
be interpreted as an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and
trigger a corresponding [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response.

"What mattered from a monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) perspective was the evolution of
real rates, which had declined to record low levels in recent weeks,"
the minutes said.
