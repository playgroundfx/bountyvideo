Turkey central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the second
straight meeting, as widely expected, on Thursday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey governed by Naci Agbal decided to retain the key one-week repo
rate at 17.00 percent.

The bank had raised the rate by 475 basis points at the first MPC
meeting of Agbal as governor in November and by 200 basis points in the
subsequent meeting in December.

The central bank suggested that it will maintain the tight monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance decisively, for an extended period until strong indicators
point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability.

Further, the bank said sustaining the tight monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance will
also foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by
facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency
substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the
perpetual decline in financing costs.

It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance, the bank added.
