Spain's unemployment rate increased in the third quarter to the highest
level since early 2018 as the [coronavirus][1] pandemic took its toll on
the labor market, the statistical office INE reported Tuesday.

The unemployment rate rose to 16.26 percent in the third quarter from
15.33 percent in the second quarter. This was the third consecutive rise
and was also above economists' forecast of 15.9 percent.

The rate reached its highest level since the first quarter of 2018, when
it stood at 16.74 percent.

The number of unemployed increased to 3.722 million from 3.368 million
in the preceding quarter. At the same time, employment advanced by
569,600 to 19.176 million in the third quarter.
