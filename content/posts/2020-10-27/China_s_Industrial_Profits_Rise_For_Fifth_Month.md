China's industrial profits increased for the fifth straight month in
September, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Tuesday.

Industrial profits grew 10.1 percent on a yearly basis but slower than
the 19.1 percent increase posted in August. This was the fifth
consecutive rise.

The statistical office cited falling factory gate prices and rising raw
material prices as major reason for the slowdown in industrial profits.

During January to September period, industrial profits declined 2.4
percent from the same period last year.
