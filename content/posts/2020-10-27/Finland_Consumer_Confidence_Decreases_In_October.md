Finland's consumer confidence decreased in October, data from Statistics
Finland showed on Tuesday.

The consumer sentiment index fell to -6.9 in October from -5.9 in
September.

Of the four components of the confidence index, those reflecting the
view on consumers' own [economy][1] at present and spending money on
durable goods improved in October.

Consumers' expectation on their own economy in 12 months remained
slightly unchanged, while their expectation on Finland's economy in the
near future weakened.
