Partly reflecting a rebound in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Tuesday showing new orders for
U.S. manufactured durable goods jumped by much more than expected in the
month of September.

The report said durable goods orders surged up by 1.9 percent in
September after rising by rising by 0.4 percent in August. Economists
had expected durable goods orders to increase by 0.5 percent.

The much stronger than expected growth in durable goods orders came as
orders for transportation equipment soared by 4.1 percent in September
after slumping by 0.9 percent in August.

Excluding the spike in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders climbed by 0.8 percent in September compared to a 1.0
percent jump in the previous month. Ex-transportation orders were
expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

Orders for primary metals showed a substantial increase, while orders
for fabricated metal products and communications equipment also saw
notable growth.

On the other hand, the report showed sharp drops in orders for
electrical equipment, appliances and components and computer and related
products.

The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods
excluding aircraft, a closely watched reading on [business][1] spending,
increased by 1.0 percent in September after jumping by 2.1 percent in
August.

"The stronger-than-expected rise in durable goods orders in September is
encouraging, but future gains will likely be more modest as the
[health][2] crisis drags on the economic recovery," said Oren Klachkin,
Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "A jump in transportation orders underpinned the 1.9% rise in
headline orders last month, while the other main categories signal that
the [economy][3] is in a more fragile state without the boost from
fiscal support."
