British retailers expect sales to fall in November after reporting a
sharp fall in October, the latest monthly Distributive Trades Survey
from the Confederation of British Industry showed Tuesday.

The retail sales balance fell to -23 percent in October from +11 percent
in September. The expected balance was +1 percent. A net 26 percent of
retailers expect sales to fall again in November.

The survey showed that conditions across the retail sectors were mixed
in October. Grocery volumes were flat, following five months of strong
growth.

Across non-food retail categories, department stores, clothing and
'other normal goods' were among those reporting falling sales, while
retailers of furniture, DIY and recreational goods reported strong
growth.

Internet sales growth also picked back up to the long run average.

"The fall in retail sales in October is a warning sign of a further loss
of momentum in the [economy][1] as coronavirus cases pick up and
restrictions are tightened across many parts of the country," Ben Jones,
CBI principal economist said.

It is no surprise that sales have dipped despite no new direct
restrictions on retail in England, as the evidence from earlier in the
year suggests consumers become more cautious as case numbers rise, Jones
added.
