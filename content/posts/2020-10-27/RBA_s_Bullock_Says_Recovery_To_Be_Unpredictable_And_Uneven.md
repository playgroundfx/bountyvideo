Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant Governor Michele Bullock on Tuesday
said Australia's economic recovery is likely to be unpredictable and
uneven.

She cautioned about rising [business][1] insolvencies and problems for
some households in servicing their debts amid uncertain recovery.

Despite the devastating effects of Covid-19 pandemic, the financial
system both in Australia and overseas has withstood the test, the banker
said.

The Australian financial system remains profitable, notwithstanding
substantial loan loss provisions. Their strong capital position allows
them to continue to lend to support the Australian [economy][2], Bullock
noted.

The banker observed that non-performing loans to households, which had
already risen over the past couple of years, are expected to continue to
rise over the coming months.

She observed that the impact on bank balance sheets of the rise in non-
performing loans will depend on whether the value of the property is
enough to cover the outstanding debt.

As there is only a very small share of loans is currently in negative
equity, losses to banks on housing loans will be limited, Bullock added.
