China's service sector activity logged a steeper growth in July as the
successful containment of the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases led to
greater customer numbers and boosted new order intakes, survey results
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

At 54.9 in July, the Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index rebounded from
June's 14-month low of 50.3 and signaled a sharp and accelerated
expansion of services activity.  
  
New order growth accelerated in July as the containment of the virus
domestically boosted customer numbers and demand. Nonetheless, new
export [business][1] remained broadly stagnant.

Although marginal, service sector employment returned to growth in July.

On the price front, the survey showed that the rate of input cost
inflation accelerated in the latest survey period. Consequently, prices
charged by services companies increased, as firms looked to alleviate
pressure on their operating margins.

Business confidence regarding the one-year outlook for activity improved
in July, picking up from June's nine-month low.

In July, the composite output index came in at 53.1, up from a 14-month
low of 50.6 in June, to point to a stronger rise in overall Chinese
business activity.  
  
The resurgence of the epidemic in some parts of China at the end of July
is expected to hurt August's PMI readings, Wang Zhe, a senior economist
at Caixin Insight Group said.

China's official second-quarter economic figures were in line with
expectations, but the Caixin China PMIs in July suggest that the
economic recovery is not on sure footing, Wang added. "The [economy][2]
still faces enormous downward pressure, and we need to ensure business
owners remain confident."
