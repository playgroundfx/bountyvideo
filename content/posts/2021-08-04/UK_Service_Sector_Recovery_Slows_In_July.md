UK service sector activity grew at the slowest pace since the end of the
winter lockdown as staff shortages and supply issues weighed on
[business][1] capacity, final survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Wednesday.  
  
The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply services Purchasing
Managers' Index declined to 59.6 in July from 62.4 in June. The index
was the lowest since March.

Nonetheless, the score was above the crucial 50.0 no-change mark and
also above the flash reading of 57.8.

Staff shortages, supply chain issues and the end of the full stamp duty
holiday for residential property sales were cited as factors leading to
a slowdown since June.

There was a substantial loss of momentum in new business growth in July.
Meanwhile, new export orders returned to growth, helped by looser
pandemic restrictions in overseas [markets][2].

Backlogs of work increased for the fifth successive month. Job creation
continued at a brisk pace in July, reflecting strong demand for staff
across the service [economy][3]. But the rate of growth slipped to a
three-month low.

Input price inflation rose to a record high in July on wage pressures,
higher fuel prices and greater transport bills.

A combination of rising input prices and stronger demand meant that
service providers increased their average charges at a survey-record
pace in July.

The latest survey suggested that service sector companies remained
highly upbeat about their growth prospects for the year ahead. However,
the degree of confidence slipped for four months in a row.

The overall private sector activity grew at the weakest pace in four
months in July. The composite output index dropped to 59.2 in July from
62.2 in June. The flash reading was 57.7.

Any re-acceleration of growth in August looks unlikely, however, as new
orders increased at a much-reduced pace at the start of the third
quarter, Tim Moore, an economics director at IHS Markit, said.
