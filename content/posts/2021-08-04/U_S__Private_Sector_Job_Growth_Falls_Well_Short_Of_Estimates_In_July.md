Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing private
sector employment increased by much less than expected in the month of
July.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 330,000 jobs in July after
surging by a downwardly revised 680,000 jobs in June.

Economists had expected private sector employment to spike by 695,000
jobs compared to the jump of 692,000 jobs originally reported for the
previous month.

"The labor market recovery continues to exhibit uneven progress, but
progress nonetheless" said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson.

"Bottlenecks in hiring continue to hold back stronger gains,
particularly in light of new COVID-19 concerns tied to viral variants,"
she added. "These barriers should ebb in coming months, with stronger
monthly gains ahead as a result."

The increase in private sector employment was partly due to the addition
of 139,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector, although the pace
of job growth in the sector has slowed.

The report also showed job growth in the [health][1] care and social
assistance, professional and [business][2] services and trade,
transportation and utilities sectors as well as a slight increase in
manufacturing jobs.

ADP said employment at midsized and large businesses increased by
132,000 jobs and 106,000 jobs, respectively, while small businesses
added 91,000 jobs.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly jobs report, which includes both public and private
sector jobs.

Economists currently expect the report to show employment surged up by
880,000 jobs in July after spiking by 850,000 jobs in June. The
unemployment rate is expected to dip to 5.7 percent from 5.9 percent.

"The ADP is not always a good predictor of the official non-farm payroll
employment figures but, for what it's worth, it suggests a clear
downside risk to not only the consensus forecast at 880,000, but our own
below-consensus 650,000 estimate," said Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S.
Economist at Capital Economics.
