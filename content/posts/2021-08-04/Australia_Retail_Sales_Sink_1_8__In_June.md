The total value of retail sales in Australia was down a seasonally
adjusted 1.8 percent on month in June, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Wednesday - coming in at A$30.590 billion.

That was in line with expectations following the 0.4 percent increase in
May.

June was impacted heavily by stay-at-home orders for multiple states and
territories, with the largest falls seen in cafes, restaurants and
takeaway food services (-6.0 percent), clothing, footwear and personal
accessory retailing (-9.5 percent), and department stores (-7.0
percent). Other retailing (-1.6 percent), and household goods retailing
(-1.3 percent) also fell.

Food retailing (1.5 per cent) was the only industry to rise as ongoing
and re-introduced [coronavirus][1] restrictions required households to
substitute eating out for eating at home.

On a yearly basis, retail sales were up 2.9 percent.

For the second quarter of 2021, retail sales were up 0.8 percent on
quarter and 9.2 percent on year at A$87.049 billion.
