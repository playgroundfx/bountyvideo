Sweden's services sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in July,
survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on
Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector rose to 69.1 in
July from a revised 67.9 in June.

Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

"This is the second highest level in the index's [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and shows that
the service [economy][1] continues to strengthen on a broad front and
that can receive additional support when the corona restrictions are
lifted," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the four sub-indices, three increased in July. Order intake and
employment rose, while delivery time declined.

Suppliers' input goods prices rose to a record high.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, increased
to 68.0 in July from 67.2 in the previous month.
