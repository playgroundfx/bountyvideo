The private sector in Singapore picked up steam in July, the latest
survey from Markit Economics revealed on Wednesday with a PMI score of
56.7.

That's up from 50.1, and it moves further above the boom-or-bust line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

A brief period of Phase 3 re-opening, announced and implemented in July,
boosted [business][1] activity and demand in the month. New orders and
output growth both improved sharply to rates not seen since June 2018
according to the survey.

Anecdotally, firms that offered goods and services through online
platforms continued to see higher business activity while those that
were affected by the Phase 2 restrictions were able to find demand
returning during the brief easing of restrictions. Foreign demand
likewise improved in July.
