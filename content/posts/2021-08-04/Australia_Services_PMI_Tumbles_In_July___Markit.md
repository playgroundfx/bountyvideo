The services sector in Australia fell into contraction territory in
July, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday with a
services PMI score of 44.2.

That's down sharply from 56.8 in June and it falls firmly beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Business activity in Australia's service sector was significantly
hampered by the latest COVID-19 wave in Australia, which brought along
increased movement restrictions in July. Demand dipped alongside
activity while price pressures continued to build amid the disruptions.

That said, workforce expansion was sustained while service sector firms
remained broadly positive with regards to the outlook.

The survey also said its composite index sank to 45.2 in July from 56.7
in June.
