Retail sales in the U.S. showed a steep drop in the month of November,
according to a report released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday.

The Commerce Department said retail sales tumbled by 1.1 percent in
November following a revised 0.1 percent dip in October.

Economists had expected retail sales to slip by 0.3 percent compared to
the 0.3 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding a decrease in sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail
sales still fell by 0.9 percent in November. Ex-auto sales were expected
to inch up by 0.1 percent.
