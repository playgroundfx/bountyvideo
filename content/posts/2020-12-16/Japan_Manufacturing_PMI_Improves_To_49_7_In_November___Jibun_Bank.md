The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in November,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 49.7.

That's up from 49.0. although it remains beneath the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, employment levels among Japanese manufacturers rose for
the first time since February, albeit fractionally. Business sentiment
eased to its softest pace since August, although optimism remained
robust.

In survey also showed that the services PMI slipped to 47.2 in November
from 47.8 and the composite PMI fell to 48.0 from 48.1.
