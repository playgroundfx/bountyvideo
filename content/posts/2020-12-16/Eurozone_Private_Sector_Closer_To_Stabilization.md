The euro area private sector moved close to stabilization in December as
stronger manufacturing output growth helped to counter a further drop in
service sector activity, flash survey results from IHS Markit showed
Wednesday.

The composite output index advanced more-than-expected to 49.8 in
December from 45.3 in the previous month. The expected level was 45.8.

The survey revealed that the economic impact of the second waves of
virus infections has been far less severe than the first wave.

At 47.3, the services Purchasing Managers' Index reached a three-month
high, from 41.7 a month ago and above consensus forecast of 41.9.
However, the reading was below the neutral 50.0.

The manufacturing PMI climbed to 55.5 in December from 53.8 a month ago.
The expected score was 53.0.

The survey showed that inflows of new orders rose marginally and for the
first time since September. Nonetheless, employment decreased across the
eurozone as a whole for a tenth consecutive month.

Driven by encouraging [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the development of Covid-19 vaccines,
[business][1] expectations about output in the coming 12 months rose to
the highest since April 2018.

Average rates charged for goods and services meanwhile fell at the
slowest rate since prices began falling back in March.

Germany reported an expansion of output for the sixth successive month
in December. The strength in manufacturing continued to offset service
sector weakness.

The flash composite output index grew unexpectedly to 52.5 from 51.7 in
November. The reading was forecast to fall to 50.4.  
  
The services PMI came in at 47.7, up from 46.0 a month ago and above the
consensus forecast of 44.0. Likewise, the manufacturing PMI advanced to
58.6 from 57.8 in November. The score was seen at 56.4.

Despite strict Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, the French private sector
logged a softer decline in December. The flash composite output index
improved to 49.6 from 40.6 in November. The expected score was 42.9.

Service providers registered a substantially slower reduction compared
to November's six-month record. Meanwhile, manufacturers posted a fresh
expansion in output.

The services PMI moved up to 49.2 from 38.8 a month ago. The reading was
also well above economists' forecast of 40.0.

At the same time, the manufacturing PMI came in at 51.1 versus 49.6 in
the prior month and 50.1 expected by economists.
