After reporting homebuilder confidence at a record high in the previous
month, the National Association of Home Builders released a report on
Wednesday showing confidence pulled back by more than expected in the
month of December.

The report said the NAHB Housing Market Index slid to 86 in December
after climbing to 90 in November. Economists had expected the index to
dip to 88.

Despite the pullback, the NAHB noted the housing market index was still
at the second-highest reading in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the series.

"Housing demand is strong entering 2021, however the coming year will
see housing affordability challenges as inventory remains low and
construction costs are rising," said NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke.

He added, "Policymakers should take note to avoid increasing regulatory
costs associated with land development and residential construction."

The bigger than expected decrease by the housing market index reflected
decreases by all three of the component indices.

The index gauging current sales conditions dropped four points to 92,
the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months fell
four points to 85 and the gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers
also decreased four points to 73.

NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz noted housing remains a bright spot
for a recovering [economy][1] even as homebuilder confidence fell from
historic levels.

"The issues that have limited housing supply in recent years, including
land and material availability and a persistent skilled labor shortage,
will continue to place upward pressure on construction costs," Dietz
said.

He added, "As the economy improves with the deployment of a COVID-19
vaccine, interest rates will increase in 2021, further challenging
housing affordability in the face of strong demand for single-family
homes."

On Thursday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of November.

Housing starts are expected to rise to an annual rate of 1.550 million
in November from 1.530 million in October, while building permits are
expected to inch up to 1.550 million from 1.545 million.
