UK inflation slowed more-than-expected in November due to falling
clothing prices, data published by the Office for National Statistics
showed on Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation weakened to a three-month low of 0.3 percent
from 0.7 percent in October. The rate was well below the economists'
forecast of 0.6 percent and the central bank's 2 percent target.  
  
"The price fall in November this year reflects increased discounting and
there have been media reports that some Black Friday sales may have
spread further across the month," the ONS said.

Clothing and footwear prices decreased 3.6 percent annually and food and
non-alcoholic beverages prices slid 0.6 percent. These were partially
offset by upward contributions from games, toys and hobbies, and
accommodation services.

At the November meeting, the Bank of England said inflation is expected
to remain at, or just above 0.5 percent during most of the winter,
before rising quite sharply towards the 2 percent target as the effects
of lower energy prices and value added tax dissipate.

The BoE is set to announce its next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision on December
17.

November's drop in inflation will not prompt the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
committee to announce any further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus tomorrow, Ruth
Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said. The bank is unlikely
to take any action for some time to come, unless there is a no deal
Brexit.

"In that case, we think the MPC would look through the temporary rise in
inflation and instead focus on quashing any financial market dislocation
and supporting demand," the economist added.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices dropped 0.1 percent in November
after staying flat a month ago. This was the first fall in three months
and in contrast to a 0.1 percent rise economists' had forecast.

Excluding energy, food, alcoholic beverages and tobacco, core inflation
eased more-than-expected to 1.1 percent from 1.5 percent in October. The
expected rate was 1.4 percent.

Another report from the ONS showed that output prices decreased for the
ninth consecutive month in November. Nonetheless, the rate of decline
slowed to 0.8 percent from 1.4 percent. Prices were forecast to drop 0.9
percent.

Month-on-month, output prices gained 0.2 percent, following a flat
growth in October.  
At the same time, input prices grew 0.2 percent on month in November,
compared to a 0.4 percent rise in October.

The annual fall in input prices slowed to 0.5 percent from 1.2 percent.
Economists had forecast an annual 2.5 percent decline.
