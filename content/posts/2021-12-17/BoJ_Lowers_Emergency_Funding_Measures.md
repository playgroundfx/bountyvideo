The Bank of Japan decided on Friday to scale back its emergency funding
measures after its major counterparts the Federal Reserve announced its
plan to end its pandemic support efforts and the Bank of England
resorted to an immediate rate hike on this week.

At the end of two-day rate setting meeting, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of BoJ,
governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, decided to end the additional purchases of
commercial paper and corporate bonds at the end of March 2022 as
scheduled.  
  
From April 2022, the purchases of securities will be of the same amount
as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that the amounts outstanding of
these assets will decrease gradually to the pre-pandemic levels, namely,
about JPY 2 trillion for commercial paper and about JPY 3 trillion for
corporate bonds.

Although the BoJ limited the additional purchases of commercial paper
and corporate bonds, it maintained other monetary stimulus unchanged and
extended the cut off for applying the special funding facility by six
months.

The board maintained the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current
accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will also continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

Further, the bank extended the deadline for applications for its
Covid-19 funds-supplying operations from March 2022 to September 2022,
in order to support small and medium-sized firms.

The BoJ will remain among the few central banks that won't tighten
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for the foreseeable future, Marcel Thieliant, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

The board said Japan's [economy][1] is likely to recover as downward
pressure stemming from COVID-19 on services consumption and the effects
of supply-side constraints wane. The economy is projected to continue
growing at a pace, albeit slower, above its potential growth rate.

Regarding risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19 and its impact on
domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention, the board
noted.
