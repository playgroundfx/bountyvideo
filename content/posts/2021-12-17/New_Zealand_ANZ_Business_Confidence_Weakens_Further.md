New Zealand [business][1] confidence weakened further at the end of the
year, survey results from ANZ showed on Friday.

The business sentiment index fell to -23.2 in December from -16.4 in the
previous month.

The survey respondents said finding labor remains firms' biggest
problem, and is getting worse, while freight disruptions are also having
a growing impact.

Expected own activity, export intentions, investment intentions,
commercial construction intentions, employment intentions, and profit
expectations all slipped further but remained at respectable levels, ANZ
said.

Inflation expectations continued to rise, while cost expectations and
pricing intentions bounce about at very high levels.

Respondents noted that supply-side problems are not going away any time
soon. And they are inflationary.
