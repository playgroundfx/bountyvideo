The Bank of Japan decided to scale back its pandemic related funding
measures as the [economy][1] is set to recover amid waning supply-side
constraints.

The board, governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, decided to end the additional
purchases of CP and corporate bonds at the end of March 2022 as
scheduled.  
  
From April 2022, the purchases of securities will be of the same amount
as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that the amounts outstanding of
these assets will decrease gradually to the pre-pandemic levels, namely,
about JPY 2 trillion for CP and about JPY 3 trillion for corporate
bonds.

The board decided to maintain the interest rate at -0.1 percent on
current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central
bank.

The bank will also continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.
