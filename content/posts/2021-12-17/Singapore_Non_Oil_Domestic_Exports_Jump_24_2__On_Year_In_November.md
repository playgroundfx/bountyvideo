The value of non-oil domestic exports in Singapore was up 24.2 percent
on year in November, Enterprise Singapore said on Friday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 17.3 percent and was up
from 17.9 percent in the previous month.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, NODX rose 1.1 percent - again
beating forecasts for an increase of 0.2 percent following the
downwardly revised 4.1 percent gain in October (originally 4.2 percent).

NODX to the top 10 [markets][1] as a whole rose in November 2021, mainly
due to China, Taiwan and South Korea, although NODX to Thailand
declined.
