Germany's producer prices rose at the fastest pace in seven decades in
November, mainly driven by higher energy prices, preliminary data from
Destatis showed Friday.  
  
The producer price index rose 19.2 percent year-on-year after an 18.4
percent increase in October. Economists had forecast 19.9 percent
producer price inflation.  
  
The latest increase in producer prices was the biggest since November
1951, when they surged 20.6 percent, Destatis said.  
  
Energy prices jumped 49.4 percent from a year ago, mainly led by an 83.4
percent surge in natural gas distribution costs and a 48 percent climb
in electricity prices.  
  
Excluding energy, producer price inflation was 9.9 percent in November
versus 9.2 percent in October.  
  
Prices of intermediate goods increased 19.1 percent annually, mainly due
to higher prices of metal. Producer prices of non-durable consumer goods
rose 3.7 percent and those of durable consumer goods increased 3.7
percent.

Capital goods prices climbed 3.6 percent from a year ago.  
  
Compared to the previous month, producer prices increased 0.8 percent in
November, which was slower than the 1.4 percent rise economists had
predicted.

In October, prices rose 3.8 percent. The latest increase was the weakest
in seven months.
