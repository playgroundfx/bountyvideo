The German [economy][1] is set to grow less than anticipated in June as
pandemic-related restrictions and supply bottlenecks for intermediate
goods weighed on activity, Bundesbank said in its biannual projections
on Friday.

The largest euro area economy will experience a setback in the final
quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 on account of the
pandemic, but is set to pick up significant momentum again in spring of
next year, the bank noted.

"The upswing has been slightly delayed," said Bundesbank President Jens
Weidmann.

The economy is forecast to grow 4.2 percent in 2022 instead of 5.2
percent projected in June. Similarly, the outlook for this year was
trimmed to 2.5 percent from 3.7 percent.

For 2023, the bank forecast 3.2 percent growth, up from the previous
outlook of 1.7 percent.

Bundesbank projected inflation to remain above 2 percent throughout the
forecast period.

"The risks for the inflation rate are skewed to the upside, both in
Germany and in the euro area as a whole," Weidmann said.

On average over the coming year, the inflation rate is forecast to rise
further to 3.6 percent before easing to 2.2 percent in 2023. In June,
the bank had expected inflation to ease to 1.8 percent in 2022 and to
1.7 percent in 2023.
