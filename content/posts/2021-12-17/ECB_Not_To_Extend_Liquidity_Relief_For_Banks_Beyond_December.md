The European Central Bank said Friday it will not extend liquidity
relief for banks that was provided during the [coronavirus][1] pandemic,
beyond December as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed that they have ample liquidity
buffers that can be used to support the [economy][2].  
  
The liquidity relief measure allowed banks to operate with a liquidity
coverage ratio below 100 percent.

A bank's liquidity coverage ratio is the relationship between its buffer
of high-quality liquid assets and the cash outflows it may face over a
30-day period of liquidity stress.  
  
During normal times, banks are expected to maintain a liquidity coverage
ratio of above 100 percent so they can use that buffer in the event of
liquidity stress.  
  
This means a bank's highly liquid assets must at least match the
liquidity it would expect to leave the bank within 30 days in a stress
situation, the ECB said.  
  
The central bank now expects all banks to maintain a liquidity coverage
ratio of above 100 percent January 1, 2022.  
  
The aggregate liquidity coverage ratio of banks under direct ECB
supervision currently stands at about 170 percent, up from about 140
percent before the Covid-19 pandemic.
