Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said regulators and financial
service firms must work together so businesses are able to get the
finance they need to invest for the future.

At the CityUK National Conference, held on Tuesday, Bailey talked about
the long-term effects of Covid-19 and the investment required to support
the recovery.

Heightened uncertainty about the future tends to have negative effect on
investment. Both Covid and the process of setting the future
relationship with the EU have increased uncertainty, he noted.

Since the release of the Monetary Policy Report, there have been
encouraging [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the vaccine front.

"If we can now see some light at the end of the tunnel, we need to focus
more on important questions about how our economies will look in the
future, how we want them to look, what will be the legacy of Covid, and
what we can do to support and prioritise any necessary more structural
changes," said Bailey.

He observed that while there appears to be no shortage of aggregate
saving, investment is weak in the UK.

As well as maintaining interest rates which are consistent with
achieving the inflation target, quantitative easing at a time like this
can prevent an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions, Bailey
said.

"At the Bank, we are emphasising work on the supply of finance for
productive investment, which is important for long-term growth and for
financial stability," the governor added.
