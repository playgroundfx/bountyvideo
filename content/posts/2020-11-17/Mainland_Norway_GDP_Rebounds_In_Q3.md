Mainland-Norway's [economy][1] recovered strongly in the third quarter
after the easing of infection control measures, Statistics Norway
reported Tuesday.

Gross domestic product grew 5.2 percent sequentially, as expected, and
in contrast to a revised 6 percent decline in the second quarter. The
second quarter GDP was revised from -6.3 percent.

Infection rates increased again in October and infection control
measures were tightened, head of the National Accounts at Statistics
Norway, PÃ¥l Sletten, said. The economy was still far from a normal
situation.

Total GDP for Norway, including oil and gas extraction, transport via
pipelines and ocean transport, grew 4.6 percent, reversing a 4.7 percent
decline in the second quarter.

The expenditure-side breakdown of GDP showed that household expenditure
advanced 9.5 percent and government spending rose 3 percent.

Meanwhile, gross fixed capital formation declined 1.1 percent from the
previous quarter.

Exports climbed 4.7 percent, while imports registered a much stronger
growth of 10.3 percent in the third quarter.

In September, Mainland-Norway GDP as well as overall GDP gained 0.6
percent each from August.
