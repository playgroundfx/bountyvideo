Homebuilder confidence in the U.S. unexpectedly jumped to another new
record high in the month of November, the National Association of Home
Builders revealed in a report released on Tuesday.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index climbed to 90
in November from 85 in October. Economists had expected the index to
come in unchanged.

"Another record high for the HMI reflects that housing is a bright spot
for the [economy][1]," said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. "However,
affordability remains an ongoing concern, as construction costs continue
to rise and interest rates are expected to move higher as more positive
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) emerges on the coronavirus vaccine front."

He added, "In the short run, the shift of housing demand to lower
density [markets][2] such as suburbs and exurbs with ongoing low resale
inventory levels is supporting demand for home building."

The unexpected increase by the housing market index came as all three of
the HMI indices reached new record highs.

The index gauging current sales conditions climbed to 96 in November
from 90 in October, while the measure charting traffic of prospective
buyers rose to 77 from 74 and the component measuring sales expectations
in the next six months inched up to 89 from 88.

"Though builders continue to sign sales contracts at a solid pace, lot
and material availability is holding back some building activity," said
NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke.

He added, "Looking ahead to next year, regulatory [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) risk will be a
key concern given these supply-side constraints."

On Wednesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report
on new residential construction in the month of October.

Housing starts are expected to climb to an annual rate of 1.460 million
in October from 1.415 million in September, while building permits are
expected to rise to a rate of 1.560 million from 1.545 million.
