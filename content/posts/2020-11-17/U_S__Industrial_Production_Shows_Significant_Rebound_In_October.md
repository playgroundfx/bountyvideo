A report released by the Federal Reserve on Thursday showed a
significant rebound in U.S. industrial production in the month of
October.

The Fed said industrial production jumped by 1.1 percent in October
after falling by a revised 0.4 percent in September.

Economists had expected production to surge up by 1.0 percent compared
to the 0.6 percent drop originally reported for the previous month.

The rebound in production came as manufacturing output shot up by 1.0
percent in October after inching up by 0.1 percent in September.

The report also showed utilities output spiked by 3.9 percent in October
after plunging by 5.2 percent in the previous month.

On the other hand, the Fed said mining output fell by 0.6 percent in
October following a 1.2 percent jump in September.

The Fed noted industrial production has recovered much of its 16.5
percent decline from February to April, but output in October was still
5.6 percent lower than its pre-pandemic February level.

"Industrial activity is settling into a slower pace of expansion
following the burst of activity unleashed by the release of pent-up
demand and a sugar rush from significant fiscal support," said Oren
Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Looking ahead, we expect industrial activity to continue
recovering its pandemic-induced losses, but growth will be slower
compared to the summer months."

The report also showed capacity utilization in the industrial sector
rose to 72.8 percent in October from an upwardly revised 72.0 percent in
September.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to climb to 72.3 percent
from the 71.5 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and utilities sectors rose to
71.7 percent and 72.7 percent, respectively, while capacity utilization
in the mining sector edged down to 77.9 percent.
