Japan will on Wednesday release October figures for imports, exports and
trade balance, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

Imports are expected to sink 9.0 percent on year after tumbling 17.2
percent in September. Exports are called lower by an annual 4.5 percent
after slipping 4.9 percent in the previous month. The trade balance is
tipped to show a surplus of 250 billion yen, down from 675 billion a
month earlier.

Australia will see Q3 numbers for wage prices and October results for
new home sales and for the Westpac leading index.

Wage prices are tipped to add 0.2 percent on quarter and 1.5 percent on
year after rising 0.2 percent on quarter and 1.8 percent on year in the
three months prior. Home sales were up 3.8 percent on month in September
and the leading index rose 0.2 percent.

The central bank in Thailand will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on
Wednesday and then announce its decision on interest rates. The central
bank is widely expected to leave its benchmark lending rate steady at
0.5 percent.
