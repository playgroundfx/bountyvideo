Non-oil domestic exports in Singapore were down 5.3 percent on month in
October, Enterprise Singapore said on Tuesday - well shy of expectations
for a gain of 4.6 percent following the 11.4 percent decline in
September.

On a yearly basis, exports fell 3.1 percent - again missing forecasts
for a gain of 5.7 percent following the 5.8 percent increase in the
previous month.

The decline was mainly due to a drop in non-electronics.

NODX to the top 10 [markets][1] as a whole decreased in October, though
exports to the US, China, Japan and the EU 27 grew.
