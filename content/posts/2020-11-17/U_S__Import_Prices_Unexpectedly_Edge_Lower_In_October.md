Partly reflecting a continued decrease in prices for fuel imports, the
Labor Department released a report on Tuesday showing U.S. import prices
unexpectedly edged lower in the month of October.

The Labor Department said import prices slipped by 0.1 percent in
October after rising by a downwardly revised 0.2 percent in September.

Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.2 percent compared to
the 0.3 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Meanwhile, the report said export prices crept up by 0.2 percent in
October after climbing by 0.6 percent in September. Export prices were
expected to rise by 0.3 percent.
