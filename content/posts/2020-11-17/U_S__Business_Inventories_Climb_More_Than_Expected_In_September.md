Partly reflecting a jump in retail inventories, the Commerce Department
released a report on Tuesday showing U.S. [business][1] inventories
increased by more than expected in the month of September.

The report said business inventories climbed by 0.7 percent in September
after rising by 0.3 percent in August. Economists had expected
inventories to increase by 0.5 percent.

The Commerce Department said retail inventories spiked by 1.7 percent in
October after rising by 0.5 percent in September.

Wholesale inventories also rose by 0.4 percent in October following a
0.5 percent increase in September, while manufacturing inventories were
unchanged for the second straight month.

Meanwhile, the report said business sales increased by 0.6 percent in
October after climbing by 0.9 percent in the previous month.

Retail sales surged up by 1.5 percent in October following a 1.1 percent
jump in September. Manufacturing and wholesale sales also inched up by
0.3 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively.

With inventories and sales both rising, the total business
inventories/sales ratio in October was unchanged from September at 1.32.
