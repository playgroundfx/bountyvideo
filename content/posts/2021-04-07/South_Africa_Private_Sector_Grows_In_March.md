South Africa's private sector expanded marginally in March, survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.3 in March from 50.2
in February. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Business output continued to increase in March, while input supply
declined. New order volume decreased for the fifth straight month in
March.

Suppliers' delivery times lengthened to the greatest extend in four
months in March. Input buying rose for the first time since November
last year.

Input price inflation rose to the highest since October 2018 and output
charges increased modestly.

Job reduction continued in March and backlogs of work increased.

Business expectation for the next 12 months decreased in March with the
hopes of an end to the Covid-19 pandemic due to the roll-out of vaccine.
