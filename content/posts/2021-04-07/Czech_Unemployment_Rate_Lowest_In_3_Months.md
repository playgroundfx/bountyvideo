The Czech Republic's unemployment rate eased in March to its lowest
level in three months, preliminary data from the labor office showed
Wednesday.

The jobless rate fell to 4.2 percent from 4.3 percent each in January
and February. The easing was in line with economists' expectations. In
December, the rate was 4.0 percent.

In March last year, the rate was 3.0 percent.

The number of unemployed was 306,616 in March, which was 4847 persons
less than in February, but 80,938 persons more than in the same month
last year.

In March, 288,355 unemployed were actively seeking jobs.

The number of vacancies rose to 338,862 in March from 330,700 in the
previous month.

The ILO jobless rate of the Czech Republic in February was 3.2 percent,
which was the second lowest in the EU.

The labor market situation is stable and unemployment is relatively low
despite the pandemic, the labor office said. The number of vacancies
exceeds the number of job-seekers, the office added.

That said, the disproportionate nature of the economic crisis persists
in the labor market, the agency noted.

Sectors such as travel, tourism, gastronomy, services, trade and culture
remain severely hurt by the lockdown restrictions linked to the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic. Meanwhile, sectors such as manufacturing,
[health][2] or social care are facing labor shortages.

"With the advent of spring, seasonal work is starting," Labor Office
General Director Viktor Najmon said.

"Employers are currently looking for, among other things, new employees
in  
agriculture, forestry, construction, logistics or e-shops."

There is also demand for skilled craftsmen and production workers and
cities and municipalities are showing a growing interest in public
workers, the official added.
