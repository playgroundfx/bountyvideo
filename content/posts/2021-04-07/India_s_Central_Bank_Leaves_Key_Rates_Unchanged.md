India's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged, as widely
expected, on Wednesday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India unanimously
voted to maintain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate at 4.00 percent. The reverse repo
rate was retained at 3.35 percent.

The last change in the benchmark rate was a 40 basis point cut in May
2019, which took the cumulative reduction since February 2019 to 250
basis points.

The Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank rate were also left
unchanged at 4.25 percent.

The bank retained its real GDP growth forecast for 2021-22 at 10.5
percent, Governor Shaktikanta Das said at the press conference.
