Despite recent signs of strength in the U.S. [economy][1], the minutes
from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting indicated the
central bank is unlikely to change its ultra-loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
anytime soon.

Participants in the March meeting acknowledged the improvement in the
medium-term outlook for real GDP growth and employment but continued to
see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated.

The minutes showed most participants still viewed the [coronavirus][2]
pandemic as posing considerable risks to the economic outlook.

New more-contagious virus strains, obstacles in getting sufficient
numbers of the public vaccinated, or social-distancing fatigue were
among the risks cited by the participants.

"However, given the resilience of the economy in the face of the earlier
surge in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and the
magnitude of fiscal support enacted, the downside risks to the economic
outlook were seen as smaller than for the previous projection," the Fed
said.

The Fed added, "The staff viewed the risks of upside inflationary
pressures as having increased since the previous forecast and now saw
the risks to the inflation projection as balanced."

With measures of the economy still below pre-pandemic levels, the Fed
reiterated that it would likely be "some time" before the central bank
considers changing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance.

The minutes said members expect to maintain an accommodative stance of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until the Fed's goals of maximum employment and
inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time are achieved.

The Fed's views were largely unchanged from previous months, with the
minutes noting outcome-based guidance did not need to be reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted
often in response to incoming data or the evolving outlook

"In particular, various participants noted that changes in the path of
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should be based primarily on observed outcomes rather than
forecasts," the Fed said.

The minutes also highlighted the recent increase in longer-term Treasury
yields, which was attributed to increased [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) optimism about the
economic outlook and expectations of higher Treasury debt issuance.

The Fed noted market depth became thin and bid-ask spreads widened amid
an especially sharp increase in yields on February 25 but said Treasury
market liquidity gradually recovered over the following days.

Updated economic projections provided after the meeting showed Fed
members now expect U.S. GDP to soar by 6.5 percent in 2021 compared to
the 4.2 percent spike forecast last December.

The forecast for the pace of growth in core consumer prices, which
exclude food and energy prices, was also upwardly revised to 2.2 percent
from 1.8 percent.

In its accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that
indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently.

Nonetheless, the median forecast from Fed members predicts interest
rates will remain at current levels through 2023.
