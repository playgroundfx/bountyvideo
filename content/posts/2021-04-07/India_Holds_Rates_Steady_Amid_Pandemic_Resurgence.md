India's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged and vowed to
continue its accommodative stance as long as needed amid a steep rise in
Covid-19 infections in the country.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India unanimously
voted to maintain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate at 4.00 percent. The reverse repo
rate was retained at 3.35 percent.

The bank had last reduced the benchmark repo rate by 40 basis points to
the current level in May 2020.

The Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank rate were also left
unchanged at 4.25 percent at the meeting.

Policymakers also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as
long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to
mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the [economy][1], while ensuring that
inflation remains within the target going forward.

Looking ahead, [markets][2] are still pricing in around 75 basis points
of rate hikes over the next 12 months. "We think that is very unlikely,
even if virus cases do subside before too long," Shilan Shah, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das also announced a government bond purchase
programme. The central bank will buy INR 1 trillion government
securities from the secondary market during the April to June period.
The purchase will begin from April 15.

The bank retained its real GDP growth forecast for 2021-22 at 10.5
percent, Das said during the press conference.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund upgraded India's growth
forecast for this year by a percent from January to 12.5 percent. The
projection for next year was upgraded to 6.9 percent.

Das said the recent surge in Covid-19 infections added uncertainty to
the domestic growth outlook amidst tightening of restrictions by some
state governments.

Inflation remained within the tolerance band in February. The future
food inflation trajectory will critically depend on the temporal and
spatial progress of the south-west monsoon in its 2021 season, Das said.

Further, high global commodity prices and logistics costs may push up
input price pressures, the central bank chief added.

Consumer price inflation is seen at 5.2 percent each in the June and
September quarters. The rate of price growth is expected to ease to 4.4
percent in the December quarter, then climb to 5.1 percent in the March
quarter of 2022.
