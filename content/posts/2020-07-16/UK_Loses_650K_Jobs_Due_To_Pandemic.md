Since March, the UK lost about 650,000 jobs due to the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic, despite the government's furlough scheme, official data showed
Thursday.

The Office for National Statistics said early indicators for June
suggested that the number of employees on payrolls fell around 650,000
compared to March. Although the number of payroll employees is still
falling, the decline is slowing.

The statistical office said there were around half a million people
temporarily away from work because of the pandemic and receiving no pay
while their job was on hold.

In the three months to May, the jobless rate remained largely unchanged
at 3.9 percent and well below economists' forecast of 4.2 percent.

At the same time, the employment rate rose 0.3 percentage points to 76.4
percent in the three months to May.

The number of unemployed increased by 55,000 from last year to 1.35
million in the March to May period.

Further, data showed that actual weekly hours worked decreased 16.7
percent annually between March and May, the largest fall since estimates
began in 1971.

Average earnings, including bonuses, slid 0.3 percent annually, which
was the first fall since mid-2014. Economists had forecast an annual
decrease of 0.4 percent.

At the same time, annual growth in earnings, excluding bonuses, grew at
a slower pace of 0.7 percent versus the expected growth of 0.5 percent.

Data showed that job vacancies during April to June were at the lowest
level since the Vacancy Survey began in April to June 2001, at an
estimated 333,000.

In June, the jobless claims decreased by 28,100 from the previous month,
in contrast to an expected increase of 250,000.

The smaller-than-expected fall in employment in May and evidence that
the first wave of joblessness in the coronavirus crisis ended in June
shows that the furlough scheme has been effective in preventing a big
rise in unemployment, Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

The big question is how large the second wave of unemployment will be
when the furlough scheme is wound down, the economist added.

Low UK unemployment masks mounting job losses, James Smith, an ING
economist said.

Job losses, unfortunately, appear to be rising, and recent data on the
government's furlough scheme suggests that these redundancies are likely
to be heavily concentrated among lower-paid workers, he noted.
