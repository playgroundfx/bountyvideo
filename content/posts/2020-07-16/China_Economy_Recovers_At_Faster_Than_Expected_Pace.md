China's [economy][1] rebounded at a faster-than-expected pace in the
second quarter underpinned by strong industrial output as global
economies attempt to recover from the unprecedented downturn posed by
the coronavirus pandemic.

Data published by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that gross
domestic product grew 3.2 percent on a yearly basis in the second
quarter, in contrast to the 6.8 percent contraction logged in the first
three months, which was the first fall since 1992. GDP was expected to
grow 2.5 percent.

Quarter-on-quarter, GDP expanded 11.5 percent in the second quarter,
also faster than the expected growth of 9.6 percent.

"Given the continuous spread of the epidemic globally, the evolving huge
impact of the epidemic on the global economy and the noticeably mounting
external risks and challenges, the national economic recovery was still
under pressure," the NBS said.

Driven by high-tech manufacturing and equipment production, industrial
output climbed 4.8 percent annually in June, faster than the 4.4 percent
growth seen in May and the 4.7 percent rise economists had forecast.

Retail sales continued to decline in June, but the pace of decrease
slowed to 1.8 percent from 2.8 percent in May. This was the fifth
consecutive drop in retail sales. Economists had forecast a 0.3 percent
rise.

In June, the surveyed unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent from 5.9
percent in May.

In the first half of 2020, fixed asset investment decreased 3.1 percent
compared to a 6.3 percent drop in the first five months of the year.
Investment was forecast to fall 3.3 percent.

In the first half of the year, industrial output fell 1.3 percent and
retail sales were down 11.4 percent.

The monthly activity and spending figures show that growth was still
accelerating heading into the third quarter on the back of strong [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

Another report from NBS showed that house prices in the first-tier
cities increased 0.6 percent in June. Prices in 31 second-tier cities
gained 0.9 percent and advanced 0.8 percent in 35 third-tier cities.
