Indonesia's central bank reduced its key interest rate for the fourth
time this year on Thursday to support economic recovery amid the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The Board of Governors agreed to cut the BI 7-day reverse repo rate by
25 basis points to 4.00 percent. This was the fourth reduction and the
last change in the rate was a 25 basis points cut on June 18.

The overnight deposit facility rate and lending facility rate were
lowered by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent and 4.75 percent,
respectively.

The bank said the decision was consistent with the objective of
achieving inflation target and maintain external stability and to
support economic recovery.
