China's gross domestic product surged a seasonally adjusted 11.5 percent
on quarter in the second quarter of 2020, the National Bureau of
Statistics said on Thursday - beating expectations for a gain of 9.6
percent following the 9.8 percent decline in the previous three months.

On a yearly basis, GDP advanced 3.2 percent - again topping forecasts
for an increase of 2.5 percent after tumbling 6.8 percent in the three
months prior.

The bureau also said that industrial production gained 4.8 percent on
year in June, beating forecasts for 4.7 percent and up from 4.4 percent
in May.

Retail sales fell 1.8 percent on year, shy of expectations for a gain of
0.3 percent after slipping 2.8 percent in the previous month.

Fixed asset investment was down an annual 3.1 percent, beating forecasts
for a fall of 3.3 percent after sinking 6.3 percent a month earlier.

House prices in China were up 4.9 percent on year in June, unchanged
from the previous month.
