The European Central Bank on Thursday left its key interest rates and
the size of asset purchases unchanged as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers weigh the effect
of the previous actions.

The main refi rate was left unchanged at a record low zero and the
deposit rate at -0.50 percent, in line with economists' expectations.

The lending rate was kept at 0.25 percent as expected.

"The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at
their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook
robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within
its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently
reflected in underlying inflation dynamics," the bank said.

The ECB also said it will continue its purchases under the pandemic
emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of EUR 1,350
billion.

"These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in
the projected path of inflation...," the central bank said.

"This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the
smooth transmission of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)."

Further, the bank said the net purchases under the asset purchase
programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion,
together with the purchases under the additional EUR 120 billion
temporary envelope until the end of the year.
