After reporting an unexpected expansion in Philadelphia-area
manufacturing activity in the previous month, the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia released a report on Thursday showing a modest slowdown
in the pace of growth in the month of July.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current general activity
dipped to 24.1 in July after skyrocketing to 27.5 in June, although a
positive reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing
activity. Economists had expected the index to pull back to 20.0
percent.
