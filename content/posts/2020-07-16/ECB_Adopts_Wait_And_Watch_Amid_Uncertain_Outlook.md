The European Central Bank on Thursday left its key interest rates and
the volume of its asset purchases unchanged as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers saw early
signs of a gradual economic recovery from the slump induced by the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, but significant uncertainty regarding the
outlook.

"Incoming information since our last monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting in early
June signals a resumption of euro area economic activity, although the
level of activity remains well below the levels prevailing before the
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the outlook remains highly
uncertain," ECB President Christine Lagarde said in her introductory
statement.

"Against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to
support the economic recovery and to safeguard medium-term price
stability," she added, reconfirming the ECB's "very accommodative"
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance.

The main refi rate was left unchanged at a record low zero and the
deposit rate at -0.50 percent, in line with economists' expectations.
The lending rate was kept at 0.25 percent.

Policymakers expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their
present or lower levels until the inflation outlook robustly converges
to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within the
projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected
in underlying inflation dynamics, the bank said, reaffirming its forward
guidance.

The ECB also said it will continue its purchases under the pandemic
emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of EUR 1,350
billion.

The PEPP was announced with a size of EUR 750 billion in March as the
Covid-19 began to severely affect the [economy][2], and its size was
increased by EUR 600 billion in June.

Asset purchases under PEPP contribute to easing the overall monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward
shift in the projected path of inflation, the bank said.  
  
The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over
time, thus allowing to effectively stave off risks to the smooth
transmission of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the ECB added.

These purchases are expected to continue until at least the end of June
2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges thatÂ the
coronavirus crisis phase is over, the bank said.  
  
Proceeds from maturing securities under PEPP will be reinvested until at
least the end of 2022. The future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be
managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance, the bank noted.  
  
The ECB will also continue its asset purchases under the asset purchase
programme at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion and an additional EUR 120
billion temporary fund until the end of this year.  
  
The central bank expects the monthly purchases to run for as long as
necessary and to end shortly before [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers start raising the key
interest rates.  
  
The principal payments from maturing securities under APP will be
reinvested in full for an extended period of time past the date when the
bank begins to raise interest rates, and as long as to maintain
favorable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary
accommodation.

The central bank will continue to provide ample liquidity through its
refinancing operations. The latest operation in the third series of
targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) has registered a
very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and
households, Lagarde said.

The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its
instruments, as appropriate, the ECB chief said.

The euro area economy contracted 3.6 percent in the first quarter and is
expected to have shrank further in the second quarter. However, a
rebound is expected in the third quarter as the Covid-19 containment
measures are eased further.

"Although uncertainty about the overall speed and scale of the rebound
remains high," Lagarde said.

"Overall, the Governing Council assesses the balance of risks to the
euro area growth outlook to remain on the downside," she added.
