Demand for secured lending from UK households is set to rise in the
third quarter, the latest Credit Conditions Survey from the Bank of
England showed Thursday.  
  
Lenders reported that demand for secured lending decreased in the second
quarter.

Similarly, demand for unsecured lending declined in three months ended
May but is set to rise in the coming three months.

Meanwhile, demand for loans from all sizes of businesses increased in
the second quarter but was forecast to fall in three months ended
August.

The availability of secured credit to households in the three months to
May decreased. Lenders expected the availability of secured credit to
decrease further over the next three months.

Lenders reported that the availability of credit to the corporate sector
increased for all [business][1] sizes in the second quarter but it is
expected to increase only slightly in the third quarter.

Further, the survey showed that the default rates on secured loans to
households increased slightly in the second quarter and is expected to
rise in the third quarter.

The default rates on loans to corporates also increased in the second
quarter and it is forecast to climb in the next quarter.
