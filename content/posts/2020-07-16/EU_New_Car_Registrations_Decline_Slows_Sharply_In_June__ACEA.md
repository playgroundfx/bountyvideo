The pace of decline in new car registrations in the EU slowed sharply in
June as countries in the bloc gradually reopened their economies after
the lockdown imposed to fight the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19,
pandemic.

Registrations of new passenger cars in the EU dropped 22.3 percent year-
on-year to 949,722 units in June, figures from the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association, or ACEA, showed Thursday.

"This does mark a slight improvement over May 2020, which saw a drop of
52.3 percent across the European Union," the Brussels-based ACEA said.

"Although dealerships opened for [business][2] again after lockdown
measures were lifted, consumer demand did not fully recover last month."

In June last year, 1.22 million cars were sold.

Car sales in the European Union is likely to fall by more than 3 million
units or a record 25 percent from 12.8 million units in 2019 to some 9.6
million units this year, due to the impact of the Covid-19, the ACEA had
predicted in June.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of volumes, the forecast for 2020 represents the lowest number
of new cars sold since 2013, when the industry had come through six
consecutive years of decline in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial
crisis, the ACEA had said.

Significant declines continued in all main EU [markets][3] in June.

However, car sales in France grew 1.2 percent, being the only exception
to the rule, thanks to demand for low-emission vehicles due to the
French government's new incentives introduced at the start of June.

Spain logged a 36.7 percent drop in sales and Germany followed with a
32.3 percent fall. Italy recorded a 23.1 decline.

In the first half of 2020, demand for new passenger cars in the EU
decreased 38.1 percent, which can be attributed to the four consecutive
months of unprecedented declines across the region.

In the UK, car sales decreased 34.9 percent annually in June and fell
48.5 percent in the January to June period.
