The Bank of Japan will on Wednesday release the minutes from its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on October 27 and 28, highlighting a modest day
for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the BoJ maintained its monetary stimulus and downgraded
its growth outlook for the current fiscal year as supply-side
constraints dampened production and exports amid weak consumption.

The board voted 8-1, to hold the interest rate at -0.1 percent on
current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central
bank. The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

Australia will see November results for the leading economic index from
Westpac; in October, the index rose 0.16 percent on month.

The central bank in Thailand will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
and then announce it decision on interest rates; the bank is widely
expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 0.50 percent.

Taiwan will provide November numbers for unemployment; in October, the
jobless rate was 3.84 percent.
