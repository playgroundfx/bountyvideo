Eurozone's consumer confidence deteriorated for a third straight month
to its weakest level since March, preliminary results of the monthly
survey by the European Commission showed Tuesday.  
  
The flash consumer confidence indicator fell to -8.3 from -6.8 in
November. Economists were looking for a score of -8.0.  
  
The latest reading was the worst since March, when the score was -10.8.  
  
The corresponding indicator for the EU dropped to -9.6 from -8.2 in the
previous month. That was also the worst reading since March.  
  
Both indicators are now well below its pre-pandemic level and
approaching its long-term average in both areas, the commission said.  
  
The survey data was collected from December 1 to 20.  
  
The final figures are set to be released along with the monthly economic
sentiment survey data on January 7.
