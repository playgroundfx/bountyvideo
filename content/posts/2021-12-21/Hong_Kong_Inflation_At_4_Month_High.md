Hong Kong's consumer price inflation was the highest level in four
months in November, data released by the Census and Statistics
Department showed on Tuesday.

Consumer prices increased 1.8 percent year-on-year in November,
following a 1.7 percent rise in October.

Netting out the effects of all government's one-off relief measures,
underlying inflation rose marginally to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent in
October.

The increase in underlying inflation was driven by the enlarged
increases in electricity charges and prices of fresh vegetables, as well
as the smaller decline in prices for information and communications
services.

"Looking ahead, inflation pressure is likely to increase further in view
of the notable rise in import prices and the on-going economic
recovery," a government spokesman said.
