UK retail sales growth eased more-than-expected in December and high
street sales are forecast to be poor next month, the monthly
Distributive Trades Survey results from the Confederation of British
Industry showed on Tuesday.

The retail sales balance fell to +8 percent in December from +39 percent
in November. The balance was forecast to drop to 13 percent.

A net 5 percent of survey respondents forecast sales to grow next month.  
  
"Our December survey confirms what we've been hearing anecdotally about
Omicron's chilling impact on activity on the High Street, with retail
sales growth slowing and expectations for the coming month sharply
downgraded," Ben Jones, CBI lead economist, said.

About 55 percent of retailers said orders placed upon suppliers grew in
December compared to 30 percent in November. However, only a net 25
percent expect orders to grow in January.
