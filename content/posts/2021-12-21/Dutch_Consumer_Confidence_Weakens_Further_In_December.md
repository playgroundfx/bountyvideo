The Netherlands' consumer confidence weakened for a third straight month
in December to its lowest level in over a year, data from the Central
Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday.

The consumer confidence index fell to -25 in December from -19 in
November. The score was below the 20-year average of -8 points.

The reading was the lowest since November 2020, when it was -26.

Among components, the economic climate index decreased to -38 in
December from -28 in November. The assessment of the future economic
climate and consumers' opinion on the past economic situation were more
negative.

The indicator for willingness to buy fell to -17 in December from -14 in
the previous month.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the household
consumption increased 8.5 percent year-on-year in October from 4.6
percent in September.
