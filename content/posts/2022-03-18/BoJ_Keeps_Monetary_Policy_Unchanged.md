The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus, as widely
expected, on Friday.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board, governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, on Tuesday, voted 8-1, to
hold the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that
financial institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The bank said in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, global
financial and capital [markets][1] have been volatile and prices of
commodities such as crude oil have risen significantly, and future
developments warrant attention.
