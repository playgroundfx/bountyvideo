The National Association of Realtors released a report on Friday showing
a sharp pullback in U.S. existing home sales in the month of February.

NAR said existing home sales plunged by 7.2 percent to an annual rate of
6.02 million in February after surging by 6.6 percent to a revised rate
of 6.49 million in January.

Economists had expected existing home sales to tumble by 6.2 percent to
a rate of 6.10 million from the 6.50 million originally reported for the
previous month.

The steeper than expected pullback came after existing home sales
reached their highest annual rate in a year in January.

"Housing affordability continues to be a major challenge, as buyers are
getting a double whammy: rising mortgage rates and sustained price
increases," said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. "Some who had
previously qualified at a 3% mortgage rate are no longer able to buy at
the 4% rate."

He added, "Monthly payments have risen by 28% from one year ago - which
interestingly is not a part of the consumer price index - and the market
remains swift with multiple offers still being recorded on most
properties."

NAR said the median existing-home price for all housing types in
February was $357,300, up 15.0 percent from $310,600 a year ago.

The report also showed housing inventory at the end of February totaled
860,000 units, representing 1.7 months of supply at the current sales
rate. The months of supply is up from a record low of 1.6 months in
January.

Next Wednesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its
report on new home sales in the month of February.
