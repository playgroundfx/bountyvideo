The Bank of Japan left its massive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus unchanged,
as widely expected, but cautioned about the impact of Russia's invasion
of Ukraine on domestic economic activity and prices.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board, governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, on Tuesday, voted 8-1, to
hold the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current accounts that
financial institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

Japan's [economy][1] has picked up as a trend, the bank said. Inflation
is likely to increase clearly in positive territory for the time being
due to a significant rise in energy prices, the BoJ said.

The bank noted that in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, global
financial and capital [markets][2] have been volatile and prices of
commodities such as crude oil have risen significantly, and future
developments warrant attention.

Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said the BoJ is
likely to revise up its inflation forecasts next month but the board
will probably stress that this pick-up is mostly driven by higher energy
prices and that inflation is not sustainably above the 2 percent target
yet.

With wage growth still muted, the Bank is set to keep interest rates
unchanged for the foreseeable future, the economist added.

Data released earlier in the day showed that core inflation rose to 0.6
percent in February from 0.2 percent a month ago. Despite rising
commodity prices, inflation continued to stay well below the central
bank target.
