Russia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Friday,
after raising it sharply at the end of February as the rouble weakened
significantly following the invasion of Ukraine.

The Board of Directors of Bank of Russia decided to keep the benchmark
rate at 20.00 percent, as widely expected.

The central bank had hiked its interest rate sharply to 20.00 percent
from 9.50 percent on February 28. The bank said the decision helped to
sustain financial stability and prevented uncontrolled price rises.

"The Russian [economy][1] is entering the phase of a large-scale
structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but
inevitable period of increased inflation, mainly related to adjustments
of relative prices across a wide range of goods and services," the bank
said.

The central bank assessed that the GDP will fall over the coming
quarters. This decline will be mainly driven by supply-side factors,
thereby producing a limited disinflationary effect.

However, the stimulus measures taken by the government and the central
bank will limit the scale of economic downturn.

The bank observed that the economy faces considerable uncertainty
regarding the speed and scale of the adjustment of aggregate supply in
response to the recent increase in trade and financial restrictions.

Economic activity and inflation dynamics will be largely impacted by
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions, the bank noted.

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is set to enable a gradual adaptation of the economy
to new conditions and prevent uncontrolled price rises. According to
central bank, annual inflation will return to 4 percent in 2024.
