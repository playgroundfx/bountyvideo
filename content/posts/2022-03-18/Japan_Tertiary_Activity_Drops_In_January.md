Japan's tertiary activity dropped for the first time in five months in
January, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on
Friday.

The tertiary activity index declined 0.7 percent month-on-month in
January, after a 0.1 percent increase in December.

Among the individual components, the living and amusement-related
services, medical, [health][1] care and welfare, retail trade, and
[business][2]-related services decreased in January.

Meanwhile, wholesale trade, finance and insurance, electricity, gas,
heat supply and water, real estate, transport and postal activities,
information and communications, and goods rental and leasing increased.

On a yearly basis, tertiary activity gained 1.6 percent in January,
following a 1.0 percent rise in the previous month. That was the
strongest increase since July.
