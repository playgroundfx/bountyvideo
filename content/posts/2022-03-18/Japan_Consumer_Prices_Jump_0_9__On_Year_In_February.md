Consumer prices in Japan were up 0.9 percent on year in February, the
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on Friday.

That exceeded forecasts for an increase of 0.7 percent and accelerated
from 0.5 percent in January.

On a monthly basis, inflation added 0.4 percent following the flat
reading in the previous month.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, rose 0.6 percent on year
after gaining 0.2 percent a month earlier.
