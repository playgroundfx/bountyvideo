Producer prices increased 25.0 percent year-on-year in January,
following December's 24.2 percent rise. This was the highest annual
increase since the survey began in 1949.  
  
Economists had forecast producer prices to climb 24.2 percent again.

Excluding energy, producer prices were 12.0 percent higher than in the
same period last year.

Energy prices surged 66.7 percent annually and the increase in
intermediate goods prices was 20.7 percent. Capital goods moved up 5.3
percent.  
  
Prices of non- durable consumer goods climbed 6.7 percent and that of
durable goods by 6.2 percent.
