Thailand's [economy][1] rebounded at a faster-than-expected pace in the
fourth quarter, underpinned by foreign demand and government spending,
the National Economic and Social Development Council said on Monday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.9 percent on a yearly basis, reversing the
0.2 percent fall in the third quarter. The rate also exceeded the
economists' forecast of +0.7 percent.

Quarter-on-quarter, GDP expanded 1.8 percent, following a 0.9 percent
fall a quarter ago. GDP was forecast to climb 1.4 percent.

The improvement was driven by domestic and external demand for goods and
services and various measures to stimulate the economy, the office said.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that private consumption
expenditures increased 0.3 percent. Government spending grew favorably
by 8.1 percent, accelerating from a 1.5 percent growth in the previous
quarter.

Meanwhile, investment dropped 0.2 percent. Exports and imports were up
17.7 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively.

Overall, GDP increased by 1.6 percent in 2021, improving from a fall of
6.2 percent in 2020.

The NESDB forecast the economy to expand in the range of 3.5 - 4.5
percent, mainly supported by the regaining in domestic demand, the
recovery of domestic tourism, the continual expansion of export of
goods, and the support from public investment.

Headline inflation is projected to be in the range of 1.5 - 2.5 percent
and the current account is forecast to record a surplus of 1.5 percent
of GDP.

While a sustained recovery in the tourism sector is expected to get
underway this year, arrivals will still be far fewer than pre-pandemic,
meaning the overall economic recovery will remain weak, Gareth Leather
and Alex Holmes, economists at Capital Economics, said.
