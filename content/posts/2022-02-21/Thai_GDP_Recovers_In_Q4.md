Thailand's [economy][1] expanded in the fourth quarter after contracting
a quarter ago, the Office of the National Economic and Social
Development Council said on Monday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.9 percent on a yearly basis, reversing the
0.2 percent fall in the third quarter. The rate also exceeded the
economists' forecast of +0.7 percent.

Quarter-on-quarter, GDP expanded 1.8 percent, following a 0.9 percent
fall a quarter ago. GDP was forecast to climb 1.4 percent.

The improvement was from higher domestic and external demand for goods
and services, including the relaxation of measures to control the spread
of COVID-19 and various measures to stimulate the economy, the office
said.

Overall, GDP increased 1.6 percent in 2021, improving from a fall of 6.2
percent in 2020.
