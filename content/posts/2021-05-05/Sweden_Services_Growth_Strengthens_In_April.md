Sweden's services sector activity expanded at a faster pace in April,
survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on
Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector rose to 65.6 in
April from a revised 61.9 in March. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

"The picture of a stronger service [economy][1] has gained increasing
ground during the spring and which has also led to an increased need for
new employment, which is positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the Swedish labor market,"
Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-indices, [business][2] volume continued to rise in April,
while suppliers' delivery time shortened to a record level.

Price pressure increased to the highest level in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
66.6 in April from 62.7 in the previous month. The index remained above
60.0 for the fourth month in a row.
