Thailand's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at a record
low, as widely expected, on Wednesday.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank of Thailand unanimously decided to
retain the interest rate at 0.50 percent. The bank had reduced the rate
by 25 basis points in May 2020.

The Committee voted to maintain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at this meeting to
preserve the limited [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) space to act at the appropriate and most
effective timing, the bank said in a statement.

The bank reiterated that it stands ready to use additional appropriate
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools if necessary.

Policymakers observed that the [economy][1] would expand at a much lower
rate due to the third wave of the outbreak which affected domestic
spending.

Moreover, the recovery in tourism would be affected by the longer-than-
expected delay in the re-opening of the country. The main driving force
of the economy would be merchandise exports.

The bank expects headline inflation to increase temporarily in the
second quarter of 2021 due to the low level of crude oil prices in the
same quarter of last year. Medium-term inflation expectations remained
anchored within the target, the bank said.

With the economy likely to remain weak for some time to come, monetary
and fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will need to remain supportive for the foreseeable
future, Gareth Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will remain at around 0.5 percent until at least the end
of 2023, the economist added.
