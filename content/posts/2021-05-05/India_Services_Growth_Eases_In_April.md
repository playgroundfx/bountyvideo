India's service sector activity expanded at a softer pace in April,
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The IHS Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.0 in April
from 54.6 in March.

Economists had forecast a score of 51.1. Any reading above 50.0
indicates expansion in the sector.

Output and new work increased in April. The rate of new [business][1]
remained unchanged from March.

The 12-month outlook for business activity weakened to the lowest since
October last year.

The overall rate of input cost inflation was the strongest seen in
nearly nine-and-a-half years and selling prices increased.

The number of payroll declined for the fifth month in a row in April and
outstanding business increased.

New export orders decreased for the fourteenth straight month in April.

The survey showed that the composite output index, which combines
services and manufacturing output, fell to 55.4 in April from 56.0 in
the prior month.

"The PMI results for April showed a more resilient economic performance
for the service sector than expected given the escalation of the
Covid-19 crisis in India," Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate
director at IHS Markit, said.
