India's central bank unveiled a slew of measures on Wednesday as the
second wave of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic cause severe strains on
healthcare and medical facilities.

In an unscheduled speech, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das
announced that the central bank will provide an on-tap liquidity window
of INR 500 billion, in order to provide immediate liquidity to the
emergency healthcare infrastructure and services.

Under this scheme, banks can provide fresh lending support to a wide
range of entities like vaccine manufacturers, importers and suppliers of
vaccines and priority medical devices, hospitals and dispensaries, and
other operators in the healthcare sector.

Logistics firms and patients are also eligible for credit. These loans
will be classified under the priority sector till repayment or maturity,
whichever is earlier.

Further, banks are expected to create a Covid loan book under the
scheme. By way of an additional incentive, such banks will be eligible
to park their surplus liquidity up to the size of the COVID loan book
with the central bank under the reverse repo window at a rate which is
25 basis points lower than the repo rate.

The governor said small businesses and financial entities at the
grassroots level are bearing the biggest brunt of the second wave of
infections.

Borrowers with an aggregate exposure of upto INR 250 million who have
not availed restructuring facilities earlier and has been classified as
'standard' would be eligible for the restructuring under the proposed
framework until September 30, 2021.

As one-time measure, banks are allowed to review the working capital
sanctioned limits of small and medium sized businesses, which were
restructured earlier. Those who availed restructuring facility earlier
can be given up to two years of moratorium.
