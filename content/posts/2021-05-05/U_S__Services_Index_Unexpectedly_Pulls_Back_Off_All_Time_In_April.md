After reporting an unexpected slowdown in U.S. manufacturing growth
earlier this week, the Institute for Supply Management released a report
on Wednesday showing the pace of U.S. service sector growth also
unexpectedly slowed in the month of April.

The ISM said its services PMI edged down to 62.7 in April after jumping
to an all-time high of 63.7 in March. A reading above 50 still indicates
growth in the service sector, but economists had expected the index to
inch up to 64.3.

"There was slowing growth in the services sector in April; however, the
rate of expansion is still strong," said Anthony Nieves, Chair of the
ISM Services Business Survey Committee. "Respondents' comments indicate
that pent-up demand is continuing."

"Production-capacity constraints, material shortages, weather and
challenges in logistics and human resources continue to affect
deliveries, which has resulted in a reduction of inventories," he added.

The unexpected dip by the headline index partly reflected a slowdown in
the pace of growth in [business][1] activity, as the business activity
index slumped to 62.7 in April from 69.4 in March.

New orders growth also slowed during the month, with the new orders
index falling to 63.2 in April from 67.2 in March.

On the other hand, the ISM said the employment index rose to 58.8 in
April from 57.2 in March, reaching its highest level since September of
2018.

The prices index also climb to 76.8 in April from 74.0 in March,
indicating the fastest rate of price growth since July of 2008.

"Looking ahead, much better [health][2] conditions, reopenings, and the
release of pent-up demand will allow badly-damaged services to recoup
their losses at a brisk pace," said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist
at Oxford Economics.

"Supply chain and hiring challenges within services, as well as ripple
effects from the goods sector, will drag on growth," he added. "However,
these issues won't pose a lasting drag as the [economy][3] returns to
full health."

As mentioned above, the ISM released a separate report on Monday showing
growth in U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in the month
of April.

The ISM said its manufacturing PMI slid to 60.7 in April after jumping
to a more than 37-year high of 64.7 in March.

While a reading above 50 still indicates growth in manufacturing
activity, economists had expected the index to inch up to 65.0.
