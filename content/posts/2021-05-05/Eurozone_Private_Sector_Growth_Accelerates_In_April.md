The euro area private sector [economy][1] expanded further in April
driven by gains in both manufacturing and service sectors, final data
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The composite output index rose to 53.8 in April from 53.2 in the
previous month. The flash reading was 53.7. A score above 50 signals
expansion in the sector.

Manufacturing output advanced at a rate little-changed from March's
survey record. At the same time, services output returned to growth
following seven months of continuous contraction.

The final services PMI came in at 50.5, up from 49.6 a month ago and the
flash score of 50.3.

"Barring any further wave of infections from new variants, Covid
restrictions should ease further in the coming months, driving a
strengthening of service sector [business][2] activity which should gain
momentum as we go through the summer," Chris Williamson, chief business
economist at IHS Markit said.

The PMIs may be a less reliable guide to activity growth than normal,
but recent progress on vaccinations suggests that the euro-zone economy
will start to recover in the second quarter, Jack Allen-Reynolds, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

Germany again led the way in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of overall growth. Spain showed the
strongest expansion for over two years. France and Italy meanwhile
registered moderate growth of overall private sector output.

Germany's private sector growth moderated from March's 37-month high
owing to the combination of a broad stagnation in services activity and
a slower expansion in goods production.

The composite output index decreased to 55.8 in April from 57.3 in the
previous month. This was also weaker than the preliminary score of 56.0.

A third wave of COVID-19 inflections halted the recovery in Germany's
service sector. The services PMI dropped to 49.9 from 51.5 a month ago.
The flash score was 50.1.

The French private sector returned to growth in April as services
activity grew for the first time since last August despite the
reintroduction of national lockdown restrictions.

The final composite PMI rose moderately to 51.6 from 50.0 in the
previous month. The flash reading was 51.7. The services PMI advanced to
50.3 from 48.2 in March and it was slightly below the flash 50.4.

Italy's private sector expanded for the third straight month in April
despite continuing contraction in the service sector. The composite
output index fell to 51.2 from 51.9 in March.

At the same time, the decline in services sector deepened in April, with
the PMI score falling to 47.3 from 48.6 a month ago. Economists had
forecast a reading of 49.8.

Spain's private sector logged its biggest growth in over two years in
April. The composite output index climbed to 55.2 from 50.1 in March.
The service sector enjoyed its strongest expansion for nearly a year-
and-a-half during April. The index came in at PMI 54.6 versus 48.1 a
month ago.

Cost inflation in the euro area intensified in April with latest data
showing that operating expenses rose to the greatest degree for ten
years, Markit said.

In part reflective of growing market demand, firms were able to pass on
some of their increased costs to clients in the form of higher charges.
Output prices increased to the greatest degree since February 2018.

Elsewhere, data published by Eurostat showed that producer price
inflation accelerated on higher energy prices. Inflation advanced to 4.3
percent in March from 1.5 percent in February. Economists had forecast
prices to grow 4.2 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices grew 1.1 percent, as expected, after
gaining 0.5 percent a month ago.
