Turkey's central bank slashed its key interest rates sharply for the
third straight month despite stubbornly high inflation and send the
currency Lira to a fresh record low.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to cut the one-week repo
rate by 100 basis points to 15.00 percent from 16.00 percent.

Under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, the bank had lowered the
rate by 400 basis points since September.

The bank had last lifted the interest rates by 200 basis points at the
March meeting under the leadership of former governor Naci Agbal.  
  
"The Committee evaluated the analyzes on the decomposition of demand
factors that can be affected by monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), core inflation
developments and the effects of supply shocks, and decided to reduce the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate by 100 basis points to 15 percent," the bank said in the
statement.

The committee expects the temporary effects of supply-side factors
outside the influence of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) on price increases to continue
throughout the first half of 2022.

The Board will consider completing the use of the limited space implied
by these impacts in December.

While the CBRT did signal that the easing cycle would probably end in
December, there is still a large risk that a self-fulling cycle takes
hold, pushing the lira to even greater depths, Jason Tuvey, an economist
at Capital Economics, said.

The decision is a reminder that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in Turkey is being
dictated at the presidential palace and also that the CBRT is now more
tolerant of a weaker lira than it has been in the past, the economist
added.
