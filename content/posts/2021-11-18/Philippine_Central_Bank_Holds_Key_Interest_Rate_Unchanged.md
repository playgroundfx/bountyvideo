The Philippine central bank left its key interest rate unchanged again
as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers adopted a wait-and-watch stance amid upside risks to
inflation outlook and a pick up in growth.

The Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the
overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent, the Bangko Sentral
Ng Pilipinas said Thursday.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.

The bank expects average inflation to slightly exceed the upper end of
the target band of 2-4 percent this year. That said, inflation is
projected to settle close to the midpoint of the target range in 2022
and 2023.

"However, the risks to the inflation outlook have shifted towards the
upside for 2022 even as they remain broadly balanced for 2023," the bank
said.  
  
Upside risks include those linked to the potential impact of weather
disturbances on the prices of key food items, petitions for transport
fare hikes, and the possibility of a prolonged recovery of domestic pork
supply.

Strong global demand amid persistent supply-chain bottlenecks could also
exert further upward pressures on international commodity prices, the
bank added.

"On balance, the sum of new data suggests that there remains scope to
hold monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings steady amid a manageable inflation
environment," the central bank said.  
  
"The Monetary Board maintains that keeping a patient hand on the BSP's
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers, along with appropriate fiscal and [health][1]
interventions, will keep the economic recovery more sustainable over the
next few quarters."
