A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed a significant acceleration in the pace of growth in
regional manufacturing activity in the month of November.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity jumped to
39.0 in November from 23.8 in October, with a positive reading
indicating growth. Economists had expected the index to inch up to 24.0.

Looking ahead, the report said the future indexes continue to indicate
that the firms expect growth over the next six months.
