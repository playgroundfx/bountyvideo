First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits were nearly unchanged
in the week ended November 13th, according to a report released by the
Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims edged down to 268,000, a decrease
of 1,000 from the previous week's revised level of 269,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 260,000 from the
267,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the slight decrease and the revision to the previous week's number,
jobless claims once again hit their lowest level since the week ended
March 14, 2020.
