The manufacturing sector in the Philippines bounced back into expansion
territory in February, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Tuesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 52.8.

That's up from the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from
contraction.

The latest result signaled a resumption of growth in the Philippines
manufacturing sector and indicated the strongest improvement in the
[health][1] of the sector since December 2018. Growth was centered on
expansions in both output and new orders with the rate of increase in
the former the quickest for over three years.

Firms mentioned that the relaxations of some pandemic restrictions and
wider material availability prompted the increase in production. New
orders, meanwhile, rose sharply with panel comments overwhelmingly
mentioning improvements in the domestic demand environment. Exports also
rose during the month, bringing an end to four successive months of
contraction.
