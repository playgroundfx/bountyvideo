The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to expand in February,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank showed on
Tuesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 52.7.

That's down from 55.4 in January, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This indicated a thirteenth consecutive monthly improvement in the
[health][1] of the sector, although the pace of expansion was the
softest since last September. The weaker headline reading was partly due
to a renewed reduction in output.

Though marginal overall, the decline in production levels was the first
for five months, as material shortages and surging COVID-19 cases
weighed on production. New order growth slowed considerably in February.
While remaining in expansion territory, the increase was only slight and
signaled a near-stagnation in growth.
