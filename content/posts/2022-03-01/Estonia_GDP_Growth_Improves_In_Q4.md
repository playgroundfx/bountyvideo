Estonia's [economy][1] grew at a slightly faster pace in the fourth
quarter, led by manufacturing, preliminary data from Statistics Estonia
showed Tuesday.

Gross domestic product grew 8.6 percent year-on-year following an 8.31
percent growth in the third quarter.

"The growth was still broad-based, but several economic activities were
affected by soaring prices," Robert Müürsepp, leading analyst at
Statistics Estonia, said.

Manufacturing returned to the pre-pandemic level and the economic
activity was further boosted by information and communication,
transportation and storage, and professional, scientific and technical
activities.

Accommodation and food service activities continued their rapid growth
after being ravaged by the [coronavirus][2] crisis.

Trade and agriculture sectors hampered growth in the fourth quarter, due
to price increases in these sectors.

Private consumption grew 6.9 percent year-on-year, boosted by the
lifting of the pandemic restrictions. However, rising prices acted as a
drag. Investments shrank 38.4 percent, mainly due to exceptionally high
reference base.

Investment by businesses in computer software and databases decreased
sharply. Households' investments in dwellings also fell.

The biggest growth was recorded in enterprises' investments in transport
equipment and in other machinery and equipment and weapons systems.

Exports grew 22.6 percent, while imports decreased 2.6 percent.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the GDP grew 1.8 percent sequentially
and 8.8 percent from a year ago.  
  
For the whole year 2021, the economy expanded 8.3 percent and rose 5.2
percent from the pre-pandemic level in 2019.
