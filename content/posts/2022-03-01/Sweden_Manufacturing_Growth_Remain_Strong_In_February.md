Swedish manufacturing growth eased to the lowest in seventeen months in
February, but remained strong, survey data from Swedbank and the
logistics association SILF showed on Tuesday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector fell to 58.6
in February from a revised 62.2 in January. A PMI reading above 50
suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

"The downward trend in the purchasing managers' index strengthens the
picture of a cooling Swedish industrial [economy][1]," Swedbank analyst
JÃ¶rgen Kennemar said.

"At the same time, the industry is being challenged by increased
geopolitical uncertainty with the Russian invasion of Ukraine with the
risk of negative effects on growth and on companies' production plans."

Four among the five sub-indices declined in February. The largest
negative contribution came from order intake, delivery time, production
and inventory, while employment rose.

Production plans in the industry remained expansionary in February.

Suppliers' raw material and intermediate goods declined for the fourth
straight month in February.
