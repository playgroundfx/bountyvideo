Australia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a
record low and repeated to maintain its supportive stance until
inflation returns to the target range in a sustainable manner.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to maintain its cash rate target at 0.10 percent.

The Board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is
sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range, Lowe said in the
statement. While inflation has picked up, it is too early to conclude
that it is sustainably within the target range.

The bank noted that the war in Ukraine is a major new source of
uncertainty. The prices of many commodities have increased further due
to the war in Ukraine.

The board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various
factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve, Lowe added.

Although the bank highlighted the risks from the Ukraine war when it
kept interest rates unchanged, an upside surprise in the first quarter
inflation will trigger the first rate hike in June, Marcel Thieliant, an
economist at Capital Economics, said. The economist expects headline
inflation to surpass 4 percent before long.

"Despite a hot labor market, surging inflation, hikes from other central
banks and rising bond yields, the Reserve Bank of Australia can still
point to restrained wage growth as a reason for maintaining its
accommodative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, therefore failing to give any help to the
Australian dollar," Robert Carnell and Francesco Pesole, economists at
ING said.
