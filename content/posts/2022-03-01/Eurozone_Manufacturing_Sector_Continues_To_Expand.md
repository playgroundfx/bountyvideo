The Euro area manufacturing sector expanded in February with growth in
both output and new orders gaining further momentum following
improvements in January, final survey data from IHS Markit showed on
Tuesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 58.2 in February
from 58.7 in the previous month.

The flash reading was 58.4. A score above 50.0 indicates expansion in
the sector.

viewed as a largely positive month for the euro area manufacturing
sector in February," Joe Hayes, a senior economist at IHS Markit said.

grew at the fastest pace since last September. New orders grew sharply
and at the quickest pace in six months. Manufacturers raised their
employment levels.

lead times lengthening to the weakest extent for just over a year.

in February, they were among the fastest on record.

logged stronger expansion. Spain was the weakest- growing of the
monitored euro area nations, followed by France.

The headline IHS Markit/BME Germany manufacturing PMI remained firmly
above the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction. But at 58.4, the
index was down slightly from January's five-month high of 59.8. The
flash reading was 58.5.

France's manufacturing PMI increased to a six-month high of 57.2 in
February, from 55.5 in January. But the score was below the preliminary
57.6.

Italy's factory PMI posted 58.3 in February, unchanged from January's
reading, to signal a twentieth consecutive monthly improvement in the

overall. The score was forecast to fall to 58.0.

Spain's manufacturing PMI improved to a three-month high in February,
reaching 56.9 and up from 56.2 and the economists' forecast of 56.1.
