Russia's manufacturing activity deteriorated in February, survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The IHS Markit Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
fell to 48.6 in February from 51.8 in January.

The latest reading reflected the sharpest deterioration since August
last year. A PMI reading below 50 signals contraction in the sector.

Output declined for the first time since August last year and new order
inflow slowed in February.

New sales decreased in February and exports fell at the steepest pace
for four months.

Employment recorded the sharpest decline since August last year and
backlogs of work decreased.

On the price front, the rate of cost inflation quickened in February.
Input prices and output costs increased.

The outlook for output for the next 12 months increased and the degree
of confidence was the strongest since August 2019, with the hopes of
increase in client demand and investment in new [technology][1] and
production processes.

"Our current forecast expects industrial production to expand 6.6
percent in 2022," Sian Jones, senior economist at IHS Markit, said.
