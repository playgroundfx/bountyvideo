The manufacturing sector in China moved back into expansion territory in
February, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Tuesday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 50.4.

That's up from 49.1 and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that
separates expansion from contraction.

Supporting the higher headline index reading was a renewed increase in
total new [business][1] placed with Chinese goods producers. Though
modest, the rate of new order growth was the quickest seen for eight
months, with a number of firms commenting on a relative improvement in
market conditions and firmer customer demand.

The increase in total sales was despite a further drop in new export
business, which was often linked to the pandemic and difficulties in
shipping items to clients. The improvement in overall demand conditions
helped to drive a fresh increase in output in February. Production has
now risen in three of the past four months, though the latest expansion
was only slight.
