Australia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged, as widely
expected, on Tuesday.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to leave its cash rate target unchanged at a record
low of 0.10 percent.

The Board said it will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation
is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. While inflation
has picked up, it is too early to conclude that it is sustainably within
the target range.

The bank noted that the war in Ukraine is a major new source of
uncertainty.

Although the bank highlighted the risks from the Ukraine war when it
kept interest rates unchanged, an upside surprise in the first quarter
inflation will trigger the first rate hike in June, Marcel Thieliant, an
economist at Capital Economics, said. The economist expects headline
inflation to surpass 4 percent before long.
