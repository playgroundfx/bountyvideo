Australia had a seasonally adjusted current account surplus of A$12.677
billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Tuesday.

That missed expectations for a surplus of A$14.9 billion following the
downwardly revised A$22.0 billion surplus in the three months prior
(originally A$22.9 billion).

The balance on goods and services was a surplus of A$11.197 billion, a
fall of A$818 million on the revised September quarter 2021 surplus of
A$12.015 billion.

The fall in the balance on goods and services surplus of $0.8 billion is
expected to detract 0.2 percentage points from the December quarter 2021
GDP quarterly movement.

The capital and financial account deficit fell A$8,916m to A$6.470
billion, while Australia's net IIP liability position was A$809.396
billion at 31 December 2021.
