Service sector activity in the U.S. saw continued growth in the month of
August, according to a report released by the Institute for Supply
Management on Thursday, although the pace of growth slowed modestly.

The ISM said its services PMI dipped to 56.9 in August from 58.1 in
July, but a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the service
sector. Economists had expected the index to edge down to 57.0.

The modest decrease by the headline index partly reflected a notably
slower pace of growth in new orders, as the new orders index tumbled to
56.8 in August from 67.7 in July. The [business][1] activity index also
slumped to 62.4 from 67.2.

Meanwhile, the ISM said the employment index jumped to 47.9 in August
from 42.1 in July, indicating a modest contraction in employment in the
service sector.

The report showed the prices index also surged up to 64.2 in August from
57.6 in July, reaching the highest reading since November of 2018.

"Respondents' comments are mostly optimistic and industry specific about
business conditions and the [economy][2] as businesses are starting to
reopen," said Anthony Nieves, Chair of the ISM Services Business Survey
Committee.

"Industries that have not reopened remain concerned about the ongoing
uncertainty," he added. "There is a challenge with capacity and
logistics due to the pandemic and the impact on deliveries and order
fulfillment."

On Tuesday, the ISM released a separate report showing manufacturing
activity in the U.S. expanded at a faster rate in the month of August.

The ISM said its purchasing managers index rose to 56.0 in August from
54.2 in July, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in manufacturing
activity. Economists had expected the index to inch up to 54.5.
