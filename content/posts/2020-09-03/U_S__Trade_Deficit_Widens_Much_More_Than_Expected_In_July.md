With imports spiking by more than exports, the Commerce Department
released a report on Thursday showing the U.S. trade deficit widened by
much more than expected in the month of July.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit expanded to $63.6 billion
in July from a revised $53.5 billion in June.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to $58.0 billion from
the $50.7 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider than expected deficit came the value of imports surged up by
10.9 percent to $231.7 billion, while the value of exports jumped by 8.1
percent to $168.1 billion.
