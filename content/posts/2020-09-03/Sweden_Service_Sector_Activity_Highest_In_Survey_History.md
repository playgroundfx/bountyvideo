Sweden's services sector activity was the highest level in the survey
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in August, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics
association SILF showed on Thursday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector increased to 56.6
in August from 55.0 in July.

This was the highest level in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Any reading above 50
indicates expansion in the sector.

"This shows a broad recovery in the service sector after the deep fall
in the spring, which in the long run should be reflected more in the
labor market than has emerged so far," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar
said.

The sub-index for [business][1] volume rose the most in August, followed
by order intake and employment. Suppliers' delivery time fell for the
seven month in a row.

Companies' business plan for the next six months were more expensive in
August, though far from as expensive as before corona pandemic.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
55.7 in August from 54.0 in the prior month.

"This strengthens the image that the recovery in the business sector has
gained momentum during the third quarter, albeit from low levels,"
Kennemar said.
