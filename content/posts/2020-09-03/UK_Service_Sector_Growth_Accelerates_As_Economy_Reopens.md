The UK service sector expanded at the fastest pace in more than five
years in August as the [economy][1] reopened after the lockdown period
in the second quarter, final data from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply final
services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 58.8 in August from 56.5 in
July.

This was the highest since April 2015 but the score was below the flash
estimate of 60.1.

The current expansion is built on something of a false reality, with the
economy temporarily supported by measures including the furlough and Eat
Out to Help Out schemes, Chris Williamson, chief [business][2] economist
at IHS Markit.

These props are being removed. The burning question is how the economy
will cope as these supports are withdrawn, Williamson added.

"Policymakers face a huge challenge in sustaining this recovery and
avoiding a 'bounce and fade' scenario, especially if virus numbers
escalate further, in which case we may be looking at a 'bounce and
slump'," said Williamson.

Despite acceleration in services activity, the survey revealed a setback
for employment numbers. Companies linked the fall in payroll numbers to
reviews of staffing needs and redundancy measures as their usage of
furlough started to wind down.

New orders grew the most since December 2016 largely due to the pent up
demand across the housing market and rising spending. However, new work
from abroad decreased for the seventh straight month.

Input cost inflation slowed due to subdued wage pressures. Meanwhile,
average prices charged by service providers were broadly unchanged since
July.  
  
Looking ahead, service sector firms remain optimistic overall that
business activity will expand over the next 12 months. That said, the
degree of confidence eased for the first time since March.

The composite output index, which combines manufacturing and services
advanced to 59.1 in August from 57.0 in July. But this was below the
flash score of 60.3.
