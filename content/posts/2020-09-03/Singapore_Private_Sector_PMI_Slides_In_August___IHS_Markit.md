Private sector [business][1] conditions in Singapore continued to worsen
in August, and at a faster rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit
revealed on Thursday with a PMI score of 43.6.

That's down from 45.6 in July and it moves farther beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, there was a renewed decline in output, while order book
volumes declined at a faster rate and job shedding continued to persist.

The overall weakening sales trend contributed to a development of unused
capacity, as reflected by a renewed fall in backlogs of work during
August.
