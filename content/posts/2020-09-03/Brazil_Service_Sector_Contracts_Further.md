Brazil's service sector activity continued to decline in August, but at
a slower pace, due to the severe impact of the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The IHS Markit Brazil Services Business Activity Index climbed to 49.6
from 42.5 in July. A reading below 50 suggests contraction in the
sector.

However, the score was the best since February though the period of
contraction extended to six months.

Activity declined slightly despite new work increasing for the first
time in six months. Job losses continued for the sixth successive month
and at a sharp rate.

As firms paid more for personal protective equipment and cleaning
products in the battle against Covid-19, cost pressures intensified with
input price inflation reaching a five-month high.

The Composite Output Index rose to 53.9 from 47.3 in July, largely led
by manufacturing. This was the first expansion in the private sector
[economy][2] since February and the reading was the highest registered
since the start of 2013.
