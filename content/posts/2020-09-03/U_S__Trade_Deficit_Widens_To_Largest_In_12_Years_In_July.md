With imports spiking by more than exports, the Commerce Department
released a report on Thursday showing the U.S. trade deficit widened by
much more than expected in the month of July.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit expanded to $63.6 billion
in July from a revised $53.5 billion in June. The deficit in July was
the widest since reaching $67.0 billion in July of 2008.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to $58.0 billion from
the $50.7 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider than expected deficit came the value of imports surged up by
10.9 percent to $231.7 billion in July after jumping by 4.6 percent to
$208.9 billion in June.

Imports of automotive vehicles, parts and engines showed a substantial
increase, while imports of industrial supplies and materials, capital
goods and consumer goods also saw notable growth.

Meanwhile, the report said the value of exports jumped by 8.1 percent to
$168.1 billion in July after spiking by 9.6 percent to $155.5 billion in
June.

Exports of automotive vehicles, parts and engines also saw significant
growth along with exports of consumer goods, industrial supplies and
materials and capital goods.

"Overall, the data suggest that trade is set to subtract close to 1%
annualized from third quarter GDP - slightly bigger than we originally
anticipated," said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital
Economics.

He added, "But we suspect that will be offset by a positive contribution
from inventories and in any case, those numbers are small beer compared
to our forecast of a 30% annualized rebound in overall GDP."

The Commerce Department noted the goods deficit widened to $80.9 billion
in July, while the services surplus narrowed to $17.4 billion.
