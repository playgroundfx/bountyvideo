The services sector in China continued to expand in August, albeit at a
slightly slower pace, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Thursday
with a services PMI score of 54.0.

That's down from 54.1 in July, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new order growth eased but remained strong, while staff
numbers expanded for the first time since January. Output prices gained
amid further increase in operating costs.

The survey also showed that the composite index came in at 55.1, up from
54.5 in July.
