India's service sector activity level was at the the highest in four
months in August, survey results from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The IHS Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 41.8 in
August from 34.2 in July.

The reading was the highest since March, before the escalation of the
global COVID-19 pandemic.

Any score below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.

Output declined further in August with the rate of contraction solid
overall and new [business][1] fell for the sixth month in a row with the
rate of decline steepest since September 2014.

Employment decreased for the sixth straight month in August, albeit at a
slower pace.

On the price front, cost burden increased for the second straight month
in August and the rate of input price inflation was faster. Output
prices rose marginally.

Sentiment for the next 12-months remained neutral in August after being
negative in the previous three months.

The survey showed that the composite output index, which measures
combined services and manufacturing output, rose to 46.0 in August from
37.2 in the prior month.

"Sustained periods of closure and ongoing lockdown restrictions in both
domestic and foreign [markets][2] have weighed heavily on the health of
the industry," Shreeya Patel, economist at IHS Markit, said.

"Backlogs of work accumulated to the greatest extent in almost 15 years
of data collection," Patel said.
