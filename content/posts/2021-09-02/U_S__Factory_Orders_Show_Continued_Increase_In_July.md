After reporting sharp increases in new orders for U.S. manufactured
goods over the two previous months, the Commerce Department released a
report on Thursday showing factory orders saw some further upside in the
month of July.

The report showed factory orders rose by 0.4 percent in July after
jumping by 1.5 percent in June and spiking by 2.3 percent in May.
Economists had expected factory orders to increase by 0.3 percent.

The continued increase in factory orders came as a 0.9 percent advance
in orders for non-durable goods more than offset a 0.1 percent dip in
orders for durable goods.

The Commerce Department also said shipments of manufactured goods shot
up by 1.6 percent in July after surging by 1.9 percent in June.

Inventories of manufactured goods also rose by 0.5 percent in July after
climbing by 1.0 percent in the previous month.

With shipments increasing by much more than inventories, the
inventories-to-shipments ratio dropped to 1.46 in July from 1.48 in
June.
