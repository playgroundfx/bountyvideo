quarter compared to the previously reported 2.3 percent jump. Economists
had expected the increase in labor productivity to be upwardly revised
to 2.4 percent.

the second quarter was upwardly revised to 1.3 percent from 1.0 percent.
The increase in labor costs was expected to be downwardly revised to 0.9
