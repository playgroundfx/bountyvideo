Switzerland's [economy][1] recovered from the COVID slump in the second
quarter, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs reported Thursday.

Gross domestic economy grew 1.8 percent sequentially, reversing a 0.4
percent fall in the first quarter and a 0.1 percent drop in the fourth
quarter of 2020. But this was slower than the 2 percent growth forecast
by economists.

In the second quarter, total GDP was only 0.5 percent lower than the
pre-crisis level seen in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Value added grew markedly in the service sector as a result of relaxed
COVID measures in the second quarter. Industry also grew, although not
as strongly as in previous quarters, data showed.

On a yearly basis, GDP was up 7.7 percent, in contrast to the 0.7
percent fall in the first quarter. Economists had expected an annual
growth of 9 percent.
