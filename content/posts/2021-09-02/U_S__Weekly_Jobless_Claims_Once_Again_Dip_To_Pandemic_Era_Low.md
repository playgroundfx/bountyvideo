A day ahead of the release of the closely watched monthly jobs report,
the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a modest
decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended August 28th.

The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 340,000, a decrease of
14,000 from the previous week's revised level of 354,000.

Economists had expected initial jobless claims to edge down to 345,000
from the 353,000 originally reported for the previous week.

With the modest decrease, jobless claims once again fell to their lowest
level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended March 14, 2020.

"We expect jobless claims to remain on a downward path, but there may be
some interruptions if businesses and workers become more cautious
because of the renewed spread of the [coronavirus][1] from the Delta
variant," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also fell to a pandemic-era low of 355,000, a decrease of 11,750 from
the previous week's revised average of 366,750.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 160,000 to 2.748 million in the
week ended August 21st, falling to the lowest level in well over a year.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also dropped to a more
than one-year low, sliding by 58,000 to 2.855 million from the previous
week's revised average of 2.913 million.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched report on the employment situation in the month of August.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 750,000 jobs in August
after surging by 943,000 jobs in July. The unemployment rate is expected
to dip to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent.
