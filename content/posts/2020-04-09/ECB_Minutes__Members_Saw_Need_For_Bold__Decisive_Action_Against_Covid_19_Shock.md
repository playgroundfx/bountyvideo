ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers agreed that there was need for decisive action to
support the euro area [economy][1] as the coronavirus, or Covid-19,
pandemic hurt economic activity in the countries in the single-currency
bloc, minutes of an emergency [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session on March 18 revealed on
Thursday.

In the unscheduled meeting, the bank announced a new EUR 750 billion
Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme to combat the risks posed by the
outbreak and escalating diffusion of the [coronavirus][2].

Just six days earlier, the Governing Council left interest rates
unchanged and announced a modest relief measure of additional EUR 120
billion bond purchases, even as it said the Eurozone is facing a "major
shock" from the coronavirus.

ECB President Christine Lagarde had said it was not the central bank's
job to close spreads and urged a strong fiscal response. Markets were
rattled by her comments.  
  
"There was unanimous agreement that bold and decisive action was needed
to counter the serious risks posed by the rapidly spreading coronavirus
for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) transmission mechanism, the outlook for the euro
area economy and, hence, ultimately the ECB's price stability
objective," the minutes, which the ECB calls "account", of the March 18
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session showed.  
  
The bank said it had become evident after the March 11-12 [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session
that the euro area was facing a common shock that warranted a forceful
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response and required additional [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus and
support to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) transmission.

"A strong response was also seen to underline the credibility of the
ECB's commitment to use all of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) instruments to
prevent destabilising and self-perpetuating spirals that could disrupt
financial [markets][3] and put financial and price stability at risk,"
the bank said.

Members broadly supported the proposal that purchases would be conducted
in a flexible manner, the minutes said, while adding that "reservations
were expressed by some members about the necessity of launching a new,
dedicated asset purchase programme."

Some members also raised concerns regarding the proposed communication
on the issue share and issuer limits, the minutes said.  
  
"However, notwithstanding the hesitation, readiness was also expressed
to go along with the carefully phrased communication, in the light of
the scale of the market disruptions and challenges faced in the pursuit
of the ECB's mandate," the minutes added.  
  
The ECB and its peers in other countries have announced several stimulus
measures for their respective economies as the coronavirus outbreak
halted economic activity to a large extent across the world.  
  
Earlier this week, the ECB announced that it has adopted a package of
temporary collateral easing measures to provide cheap loans to banks,
even if it meant the central bank taking on greater risk.  
  
The big euro area countries are facing severe impact on their economic
output and countries like Italy and Spain are seeing huge loss of human
lives as the coronavirus spread across Europe.  
  
The Bank of France this week estimated that the French economy is set to
shrink 6 percent in the first quarter due to the Covid-19 disruption,
thus pushing the economy into a technical recession. The predicted
decline is the worst since 1945.  
  
Lagarde reportedly said the euro area economy could shrink over 10
percent this year, which is the worst on record, if the lockdowns
continue over an extended period of time.
