With energy prices falling sharply, the Labor Department released a
report on Thursday showing a modest decrease in U.S. producer prices in
the month of March.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
dipped by 0.2 percent in March after sliding by 0.6 percent in February.
Economists had expected prices to drop by 0.4 percent.

Meanwhile, the report said core producer prices, which exclude food and
energy prices, rose by 0.2 percent in March after slipping by 0.3
percent in February. Core prices were expected to show no change.
