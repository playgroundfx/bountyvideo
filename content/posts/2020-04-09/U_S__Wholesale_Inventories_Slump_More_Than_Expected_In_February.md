Reflecting decreases in inventories of both durable and non-durable
goods, the Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing a
bigger than expected decrease in U.S. wholesale inventories in the month
of February.

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories slid by 0.7 percent
in February after falling by a revised 0.6 percent in January.

Economists had expected wholesale inventories to decrease by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.4 percent drop originally reported for the previous
month.

The bigger than expected decline in wholesale inventories came as
inventories of durable goods slumped by 0.8 percent and inventories of
non-durable goods fell by 0.4 percent.

The report also said wholesale sales tumbled by 0.8 percent in February
following a 1.3 percent jump in the previous month.

While sales of durable goods inched up by 0.1 percent, the uptick was
more than offset by a 1.6 percent nosedive in sales of non-durable
goods.

With inventories and sales both falling, the inventories/sales ratio for
merchant wholesalers in February was unchanged from the previous month
at 1.31.
