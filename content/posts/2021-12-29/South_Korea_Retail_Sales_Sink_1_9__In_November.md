The total value of retail sales was down a seasonally adjusted 1.9
percent on month in November, Statistics Korea said on Thursday.

That missed forecasts for a decline of 1.0 percent following the 0.2
percent increase in October.

On a yearly basis, retail sales climbed 4.6 percent - shy of
expectations for a gain of 5 percent and was down from the 7.4 percent
increase in the previous month.
