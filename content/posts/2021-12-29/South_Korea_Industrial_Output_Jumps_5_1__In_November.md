Industrial production in South Korea climbed a seasonally adjusted 5.1
percent on month in November, Statistics Korea said on Thursday.

That easily beat expectations for an increase or 2.5 percent following
the upwardly revised 2.9 percent contraction in October (originally -3.0
percent).

On a yearly basis, industrial production advanced 5.9 percent - again
exceeding forecasts for 3.2 percent and accelerating from 4.5 percent in
the previous month.

The index of all industry production was up 3/2 percent on month and 5.3
percent on year in November.
