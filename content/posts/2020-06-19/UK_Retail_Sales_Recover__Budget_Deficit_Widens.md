UK retail sales recovered at a faster than expected pace in May driven
by non-food store sales and the budget deficit reached a record high
amid high expenditure, official data showed Friday.

Retail sales volume increased at a pace of 12 percent on month, in
contrast to an 18 percent decrease in April, the Office for National
Statistics reported. Sales were forecast to climb 5.7 percent.

Similarly, sales volume excluding auto fuel, advanced 10.2 percent
versus a 15 percent fall a month ago and economists' forecast of 4.5
percent.

Non-food stores provided the largest positive contribution to the
monthly growth in May, aided by a strong increase of 42.0 percent in
household goods stores.

Retail sales including auto fuel, declined 13.1 percent on year,
following a 22.7 percent decrease in April. This was slower than the
17.1 percent decrease economists' had forecast.

Excluding auto fuel, retail sales dropped a slower pace of 9.8 percent
after declining 18.5 percent in the previous month. Economists had
expected an annual fall of 14.4 percent.

In a separate communiqu√©, the ONS said the budget deficit widened to a
record high in May.

Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks, totaled GBP
55.2 billion, roughly nine times or GBP 49.6 billion more than in May
2019. This was the highest borrowing in any month on record began in
1993.
