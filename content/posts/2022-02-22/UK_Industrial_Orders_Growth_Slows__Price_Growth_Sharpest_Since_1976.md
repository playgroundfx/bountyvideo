The UK manufacturing orders grew at a slower pace in February and
manufacturers expect prices to rise at the fastest pace since December
1976, the latest Industrial Trends survey results from the Confederation
of British Industry showed on Tuesday.

The order book balance fell unexpectedly to 20 percent in February from
24 percent in January. The expected balance was 25 percent.

At the same time, a net balance of 77 percent expects prices to rise in
the next three months, the highest since December 1976.

Further, growth in output volumes accelerated in the three months to
February, with the balance rising to +26 percent from +14 percent.

Tom Crotty, Group Director at INEOS and Chair of the CBI Manufacturing
Council, said, "It is great to see that total order books remained
strong in February and that output volumes grew more quickly than in
last month's survey, increasing in 13 out of 17 sectors."

"But with rising prices and inadequate stocks of finished goods, the
cost-of-living crunch continues to bite across the sector, alongside
continuing global energy and supply chain challenges," Crotty added.
