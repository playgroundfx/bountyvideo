China's exports grew more than expected in April as global demand
remained strong, data from the General Administration of Customs
revealed on Friday.

Exports advanced 32.3 percent on a yearly basis in April. Economists had
forecast the growth rate to ease to 24.1 percent from 30.6 percent
posted in March.

Likewise, imports surged 43.1 percent from the previous year versus the
expected growth of 42.5 percent. Imports had advanced 38.1 percent in
March.

The trade surplus totaled $42.85 billion in April, which was above the
expected level of $28.1 billion.  
  
Looking ahead, trade volumes are probably close to a cyclical peak,
Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
Admittedly, the current supply constraints should ease over the coming
quarters.

But at the same time, vaccine rollouts and looser social distancing
restrictions in developed [markets][1] will start to reverse the
pandemic-induced surge in demand for Chinese exports, the economist
noted.

Further, the economist said China's domestic recovery is levelling off
and a tighter [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance means that the composition of output looks
set to shift toward services and away from credit and import-intensive
sectors like industry and construction.
