Employment in the U.S. increased by far less than expected in the month
of April, according to a closely watched report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The report said non-farm payroll employment rose by 266,000 jobs in
April after surging by a downwardly revised 770,000 jobs in March.

Economists had expected employment to spike by 978,000 jobs compared to
the jump of 916,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The Labor Department said notable job gains in leisure and hospitality,
other services, and local government education were partly offset by
employment declines in temporary help services and couriers and
messengers.

The report also showed the unemployment rate inched up to 6.1 percent in
April from 6.0 percent in March. Economists had expected the
unemployment rate to drop to 5.8 percent.
