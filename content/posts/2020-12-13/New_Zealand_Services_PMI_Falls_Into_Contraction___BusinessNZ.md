The services sector in New Zealand slipped into contraction territory in
November, the latest survey from BusinessNZ showed on Monday with a
Performance of Services Index score of 46.7.

That's down from the downwardly revised 50.8 in October (originally
51.4) and it falls beneath the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates
expansion from contraction.

Almost all of the sub-indices were in contraction in November.
Activity/Sales (45.5) went further in contraction from last month, while
New Orders (52.6) experienced lower expansion levels. Employment (49.1)
remained in contraction for the ninth consecutive month, while
logistical disruptions continued to be evident with Supplier Deliveries
(39.8) at its lowest since April.
