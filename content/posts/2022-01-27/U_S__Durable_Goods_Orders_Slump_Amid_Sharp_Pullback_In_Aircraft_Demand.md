Reflecting a sharp pullback in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing new orders for
U.S. manufactured durable goods fell by more than expected in the month
of December.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders slumped by 0.9 percent
in December after soaring by an upwardly revised 3.2 percent in
November.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to decrease by 0.5 percent
compared to the 2.6 percent spike that had been reported for the
previous month.

The bigger than expected drop in durable goods orders came as orders for
transportation equipment tumbled by 3.9 percent in December after
surging by 8.2 percent in November.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts helped lead the way lower,
plummeting by 14.4 percent in December after skyrocketing by 41.9
percent in November.

Excluding the steep drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders rose by 0.4 percent in December after jumping by 1.1
percent in November. Ex-transportation orders were expected to increase
by 0.5 percent.

The report showed a sharp pullback in orders for computers and
electronic products, while orders for primary metals and fabricated
metal products saw significant growth.

"Looking past transportation, the underlying details are generally
encouraging and signal businesses maintain a 'glass half full' view of
the [economy][1] in spite of Covid and ongoing operating challenges,"
said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

The report showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a key indicator of [business][2] spending, came in flat in
December after rising by 0.3 percent in November.

Meanwhile, shipments in the same category, which is the source data for
equipment investment in GDP, jumped by 1.3 percent in December following
a 0.4 percent increase in November.

"Looking ahead, we expect the imbalance between strong demand and
limited supply to persist in 2022 as supply chain woes recede only
gradually," Klachkin said.

He added, "While worse [health][3] conditions pose clear downside risks
to the recovery in the near term, they could also incentivize stronger
business investment as executives push to increase their resiliency and
minimize the impact of future shocks, particularly from overseas."
