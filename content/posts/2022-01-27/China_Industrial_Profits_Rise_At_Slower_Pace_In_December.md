China's industrial profits increased at a slower pace at the end of the
year, reports said citing data published by the National Bureau of
Statistics on Thursday.  
  
Industrial profits increased 4.2 percent on a yearly basis in December,
slower than the 9.0 percent rise in November.

Higher input costs increased operational cost of smaller firms.

In the whole year of 2021, industrial profits advanced 34.3 percent from
the last year, reports said.

Data released earlier this month showed that the Chinese [economy][1]
logged a stronger growth of 8.1 percent in 2021, better than the
government's target of above 6 percent.
