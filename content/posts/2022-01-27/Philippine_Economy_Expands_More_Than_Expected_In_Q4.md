The Philippine [economy][1] expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in
the fourth quarter, underpinned by robust household spending and
investment, data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed on
Thursday.

Gross domestic product grew 7.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth
quarter, faster than the 6.9 percent rise in the third quarter and the
economists' forecast of 6.2 percent.

On a quarterly basis, the economy grew 3.1 percent, better than the
expected rate of 1.2 percent.

In the whole year of 2021, GDP advanced 5.6 percent, in contrast to the
9.6 percent contraction posted in 2020.

Among major economic sectors, industry and services registered positive
annual growth of 8.2 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. Meanwhile,
agriculture, forestry, and fishing logged a contraction of -0.3 percent
in the fourth quarter.

On the demand side, household final consumption expenditure grew 7.5
percent and government spending by 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
Gross capital formation climbed 12.6 percent.

At the same time, exports and imports were up 8.3 percent and 13.7
percent, respectively.

The overall recovery has a long way to go, and the economy will remain
in catch-up mode throughout 2022, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. As such, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is set to remain loose.

Nicholas Mapa, an ING economist said growth dynamics suggest that a
decent recovery is still possible, even more so with the elections in
May likely to provide a boost to overall economic activity.
