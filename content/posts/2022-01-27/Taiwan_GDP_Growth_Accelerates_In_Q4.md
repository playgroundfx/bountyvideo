Taiwan's economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter on the back
of a recovery in consumer spending, advance estimates from the
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics showed
Thursday.

Real gross domestic product expanded 4.88 percent on a yearly basis in
the fourth quarter, following a 3.7 percent rise in the third quarter.
The growth was forecast to rise marginally to 3.8 percent.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualized basis, GDP
climbed 11.13 percent after posting a marginal 1.07 percent expansion a
quarter ago.

In the full-year of 2021, GDP grew 6.28 percent compared to 3.36 percent
growth in 2020.

In the fourth quarter, real exports of goods and services rose 11.92
percent, mainly driven by the strong foreign demand for manufacturing
products, as well as thriving shipment services. Imports also increased
by 15.56 percent.

Real private final consumption climbed 1.62 percent, an upturn from the
5.60 percent decline in the previous quarter. Growth in government
spending advanced to 5.1 percent from 3.31 percent.

Gross fixed capital formation moved up 13.92 percent, but slower than
the 31.69 percent surge in the prior quarter.

Growth is set to slow over the coming quarters on the back of weaker
exports, while Omicron poses a major downside risk to the [economy][1],
Gareth Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

"Despite the strong performance, we doubt the central bank will be in
any hurry to raise interest rates provided inflation continues to fall
back, as we anticipate," Leather added.
