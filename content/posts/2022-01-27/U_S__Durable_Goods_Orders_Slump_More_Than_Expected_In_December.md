Reflecting a sharp pullback in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing new orders for
U.S. manufactured durable goods fell by more than expected in the month
of December.

The Commerce Department durable goods orders slumped by 0.9 percent in
December after soaring by an upwardly revised 3.2 percent in November.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to decrease by 0.5 percent
compared to the 2.6 percent spike that had been reported for the
previous month.

Excluding the steep drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders rose by 0.4 percent in December after jumping by 1.1
percent in November. Ex-transportation orders were expected to increase
by 0.5 percent.
