The Czech Republic's manufacturing sector growth increased slightly in
April, as output and new order gains eased, survey data from IHS Markit
showed Monday.

The purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for the manufacturing sector
rose to 58.9 in April from 58.0 in March. Economists had forecast a
reading of 59.

A PMI reading above 50 signals growth in the sector.

Input delivery times lengthened in April and output growth slowed. New
order grew at a softer pace.

The number of workforce increased in April, with the rate of job
creation steepest in over three years. Backlogs of work increased at the
fastest pace since March 2018.

Input cost increased at the sharpest pace since June 2001 and selling
prices rose at the quickest rate since the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Purchasing activity rose sharply in April and stocks of finished goods
declined at a softer pace.

Output expectation improved in April and the degree of confidence rose
to the highest in three months on hopes of an end to the Covid-19
pandemic.

"In line with company optimism, our current forecast expects industrial
production to rise 7.2 percent on the year in 2021," Sian Jones, senior
economist at IHS Markit, said.
