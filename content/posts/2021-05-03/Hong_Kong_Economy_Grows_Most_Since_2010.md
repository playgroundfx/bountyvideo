Ending a long and severe long recession, Hong Kong's [economy][1] grew
at the fastest pace in more than a decade in the first quarter of 2021,
underpinned by robust exports, advance estimate from the Census and
Statistics Department showed on Monday.

GDP grew 7.8 percent from a year earlier, in contrast to the decrease of
2.8 percent in the fourth quarter. This was the first growth since the
second quarter of 2019 and the biggest expansion since the first quarter
of 2010.

The government forecast the economy to grow in the range of 3.5 percent
to 5.5 percent this year.

Quarter-to-quarter, GDP increased 5.3 percent versus a 0.5 percent rise
in the preceding quarter.

The economic recovery was uneven and overall economic activity was still
below the pre-recession level, as the pandemic and social distancing
requirements continued to weigh on certain economic segments, a
government spokesman said.

Looking ahead, the global economic recovery led by the Mainland and the
US should bode well for Hong Kong's exports of goods in the near term,
spokesman added.

With the virus situation under control, the recovery is likely to
continue to gain momentum over the coming quarters, Sheana Yue, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that private consumption climbed
1.6 percent versus a 6.9 percent decline in the fourth quarter.
Likewise, government spending rose 6.7 percent.

The growth in gross domestic fixed capital formation rose to 4.5 percent
from 3.6 percent in the prior quarter.

Exports of goods gained 30.6 percent on year, while shipments of
services fell 8.7 percent. At the same time, imports of goods rose 23.3
percent, and that of services slid 14.9 percent.
