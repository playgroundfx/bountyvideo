Sweden's manufacturing sector expanded at a sharply faster pace in
April, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF
showed on Monday.

The purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector increased to
69.1 in April from 64.7 in March. Economists had expected an improvement
to 62.5.

A PMI reading above 50 suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

"Since the bottom level in April last year, the PMI total has increased
by 32.7 index units, which is a much faster rise compared to the
recovery after the global financial crisis of 2008/09," Swedbank analyst
Jorgen Kennemar said.

Among the sub-indices, the largest positive contribution came from order
intake, production, delivery time and employment.

The Swedish manufacturing industry showed a growing optimism in the
industry to increase production in the next six months, despite
destructions in global trade and a shortage of inputs.

Prices for suppliers' raw materials and intermediate goods increased to
the highest level in twenty-six years.

"It is becoming increasingly clear that the higher level of activity in
industry, rising global raw material prices and supply disruptions have
led to increased cost pressures at the producer level, which in the long
run may have an impact on consumer prices," Kennemar said.
