The manufacturing sector in Malaysia turned to expansion in April, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Monday with a survey record manufacturing PMI score of 53.9.

That's up from 49.9 in March and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New order volumes also returned to expansion territory in April, the
first rise since September 2018. At the same time, there was a renewed
fall in employment at Malaysian manufacturing firms.

Input costs increased for the eleventh consecutive month in April,
reflecting higher prices of raw materials and logistics. The rate of
input price inflation accelerated to the fastest in just over four
years.

Malaysian manufacturers were increasingly optimistic regarding the year
ahead outlook for output.
