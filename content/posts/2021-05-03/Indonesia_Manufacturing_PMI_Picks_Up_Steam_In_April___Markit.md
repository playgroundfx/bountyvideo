The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to expand in April, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 54.6.

That's up from 53.2 in March and it moves further above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New [business][1] expanded substantially, and at by far the fastest pace
since the survey began in April 2011. Firms often cited improvements in
customer demand. Moreover, total new orders were boosted by a return to
growth of new business from abroad. Exports increased for the first time
in 17 months.

With new business expanding sharply, Indonesian manufacturers also
increased their production volumes. As was the case with new orders, the
rise was the steepest on record.

There was again widespread optimism that output will continue to rise
over the coming year.
