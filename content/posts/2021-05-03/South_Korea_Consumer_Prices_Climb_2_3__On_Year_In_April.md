Consumer prices in South Korea were up 2.3 percent on year in April,
Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.

That surpassed forecasts for 2.15 percent and was up from 1.5 percent in
March. It was the highest annual reading since August 2017, which saw an
inflation rate of 2.5 percent.

On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.2 percent - again beating
expectations for 0.1 percent, which would have been unchanged from the
previous month.

Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food prices, advanced an
annual 1.1 percent.
