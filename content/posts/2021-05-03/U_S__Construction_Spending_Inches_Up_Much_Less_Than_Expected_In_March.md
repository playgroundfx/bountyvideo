With a jump in spending on residential construction partly offset by
decreases in spending on non-residential construction and public
construction, the Commerce Department released a report on Monday
showing U.S. construction spending rose by much less than expected in
the month of March.

The report said construction spending inched up by 0.2 percent to an
annual rate of $1.513 trillion in March after falling by 0.6 percent to
a revised rate of $1.510 trillion in February.

Economists had expected construction spending to spike by 2.0 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent drop originally reported for the previous
month.

The uptick in construction spending came as spending on residential
construction surged up by 1.7 percent to an annual rate of $725.2
billion.

On the other hand, the report showed spending on non-residential
construction slid by 0.9 percent to an annual rate of $444.0 billion.

Spending on public construction also tumbled by 1.5 percent to an annual
rate of $343.9 billion, reflecting steep drops in spending on both
educational and highway construction.

Compared to the same month a year ago, total construction spending in
March was up by 5.3 percent.
