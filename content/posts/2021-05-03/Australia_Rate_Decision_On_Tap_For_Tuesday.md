The Reserve Bank of Australia will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
on Tuesday and then announce its decision on interest rates,
highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The RBA is
widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at the
record low 0.10 percent.

Australia also will see March figures for imports, exports, trade
balance and home loans. In February, imports were up 5.0 percent on
month and exports were down 1.0 percent for a trade surplus of A$7.529
billion. Home loans were down 1.8 percent on month and investment
lending climbed 4.5 percent.

South Korea will release April figures for consumer prices, with
forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.1 percent on month and 2.15
percent on year following the 0.1 percent monthly increase and the 1.5
percent yearly gain in March.

Hong Kong will see March numbers for retail sales; in February, sales
surged 31.7 percent on year.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Japan (Greenery Day), China (Labor Day) and
Thailand (Coronation Day) are closed on Tuesday.
