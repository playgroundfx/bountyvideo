The manufacturing sector in Myanmar continued to contract in April,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics
revealed on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 33.0.

That's up from 27.5 in March and it remains beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

All five of the PMI components had positive directional influences on
the headline figure in April, but four (the exception being suppliers'
delivery times) remained well inside negative territory. Output and new
orders both fell at the fifth-fastest rates in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), while
stocks of purchases and employment contracted at the third- and fourth-
quickest rates on record, respectively.

Although firms expect output to rise by April 2022 on balance, overall
expectations were the weakest in over two years.
