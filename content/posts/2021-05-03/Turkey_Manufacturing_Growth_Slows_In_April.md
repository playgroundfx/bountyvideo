Turkey's manufacturing sector grew at a softer pace in April, mainly due
to the current wave of Covid-19 infections, survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Monday.

The headline Istanbul Chamber of Industry Turkey manufacturing
Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 50.4 in April from 52.6 in March. Any
reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

Output growth eased at a three-month sequence and new orders growth
moderated in April. New [business][1] from abroad increased for the
fourth month in a row.

The number of employment expanded in April, albeit at a softer pace.
Outstanding works declined to the greatest extend since May last year.

Input costs increased sharply in April and selling prices rose.

The overall business confidence improved marginally in April and the
sector strengthened to the least extent in the current eleven-month
sequence of growth.

"Performance in the months to come will likely depend on how quickly
infections come down, helping the sector to operate in a more normal
environment," Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
