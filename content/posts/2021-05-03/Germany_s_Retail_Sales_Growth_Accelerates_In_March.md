Germany's retail sales grew at a much faster pace in March, data from
Destatis showed on Monday.

Retail sales grew by a real 7.7 percent on a monthly basis in March,
faster than the 2.7 percent increase in February and 3 percent rise
economists had forecast.

On a yearly basis, retail sales rebounded 11 percent, reversing a 6.6
percent fall in the previous month and confounding expectations for a
decrease of 0.3 percent.

Data showed that food, beverages and tobacco sales gained 2.9 percent
and non-food product sales surged 17.5 percent.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales increased 7.4 percent on month and 12.3
percent annually in March.

In March, the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and seasonally adjusted real turnover increased
by 4.4 percent compared with the pre-crisis month of February 2020.
