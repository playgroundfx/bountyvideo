The Dutch manufacturing sector grew at a record pace in April, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The NEVI manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 67.2
in April from 64.7 in March. Any reading above 50.0 indicates expansion
in the sector.

Output increased in April and new export orders rose at the second-
fastest pace in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Employment increased in April with the rate of job creation steepest for
three years. Suppliers' delivery time lengthened to the greatest extend
on record.

Cost burden rose at the steepest pace on record and average charges
increased at the quickest rate in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Purchasing activity continued to increase in April, while stocks of
finished goods declined for the tenth month in a row.

Firms remained confident that output will continue to rise in the coming
year.

"The Dutch company Philips, which produces medical appliances, warns
that even production of critical heart nursing equipment might grind to
a halt," Albert Jan Swart, manufacturing sector economist at ABN AMRO,
said.
