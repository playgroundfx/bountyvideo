The jobless rate in Japan came in at a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent
in March, the Ministry of Communications and Internal Affairs said on
Tuesday.

That was beneath expectations for 2.8 percent, which would have been
unchanged from the January reading.

The job-to-applicant ration was 1.21, which beat forecasts for 1.20 -
which was the same as the previous month.

The participation rate was 61.8 percent, exceeding estimates for 61.7
percent, which would have been unchanged.
