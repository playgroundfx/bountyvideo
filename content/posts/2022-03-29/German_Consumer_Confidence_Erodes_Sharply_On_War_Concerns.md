Germany's consumer confidence is set to weaken more than expected in
April, hurt significantly by the concerns over the war in Ukraine,
results of a closely-watched survey revealed Tuesday.  
  
The forward-looking consumer confidence index dropped to -15.5 from a
revised -8.5 in March, the market research growth GfK said. Economists
had expected a reading of -14.  
  
The survey was conducted from March 3 to 14.

The downward trend in the headline index continued and a sharp increase
in the propensity to save in March further reinforced it, the agency
added.  
  
"In February hopes were still high that consumer sentiment would recover
significantly with the foreseeable easing of pandemic-related
restrictions," Rolf Burkl, GfK consumer expert, said.  
  
"However, the start of the war in Ukraine caused these hopes to vanish
into thin air."

Burkl pointed out that rising uncertainty and sanctions against Russia
have caused energy prices in particular to skyrocket, putting a
noticeable strain on general consumer sentiment.

The income expectations index of the survey shed 25 points to reach
-22.1, which is the lowest value since January 2009, when it was -22.9
in the backdrop of the global financial crisis.

Purchasing power is hurt by the escalating inflation that is mainly
driven by higher prices of gas, heating oil and gasoline, GfK said.  
  
Citing one of its recent surveys regarding the consequences of the war
in Ukraine, GfK said nine out of ten Germans are extremely or very
concerned about the sharp rise in prices in the energy sector and around
80 percent expressed concern over prices of groceries.

The economic expectations decreased in March, following two consecutive
increases. The indicator lost 33 points to reach -8.9 points, which was
lowest since May 2020, during the first Covid-related lockdown, when it
was at -10.4 points.  
  
Risk factors, including the risk of recession, clearly dwarf the
positive impulse to be expected from the easing measures, GfK said.  
  
The propensity to buy indicator dropped 3.5 points to -2.1, which was
the lowest since April 2020, when it was at -4.6 points.

"A sustainable recovery of the consumer sentiment is only possible with
a rapid ceasefire followed by peace negotiations," Burkl added.
