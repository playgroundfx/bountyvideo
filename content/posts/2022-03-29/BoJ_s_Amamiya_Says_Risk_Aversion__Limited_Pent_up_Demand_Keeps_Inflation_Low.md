Japan's inflation remained low while it surged in the United States and
Europe due to strong risk aversion of Japanese households, and limited
pent-up demand for private consumption, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor
Amamiya Masayoshi said on Tuesday.

As a result, Japan's real GDP still has not recovered to the pre-
pandemic level seen in 2019, Amamiya said.

Amamiya noted that overall demand has been relatively weak in Japan, and
demand shifts from services to goods have been somewhat slow. Japan
therefore has not seen a surge in goods prices like the one observed in
the United States.

"The current phase has once again brought to the fore the "norm" in
Japan -- that is, the Japanese-specific behavior of firms based on the
assumption that prices will not increase easily," he said. Further,
supply-side constraints in Japan have not been as severe as in the
United States and Europe.

Also, issues concerning the measurement of price indexes may also have a
non-negligible impact on Japan's inflation rate, the deputy governor
added.
