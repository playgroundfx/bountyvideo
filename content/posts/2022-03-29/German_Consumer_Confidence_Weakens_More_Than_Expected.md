Germany's consumer confidence is set to weaken more than expected in
April, hurt significantly by the war in Ukraine, results of a closely-
watched survey revealed Tuesday.

The forward-looking consumer confidence index dropped to -15.5 from a
revised -8.5 in March, the market research growth GfK said. Economists
had expected a reading of -14.

The downward trend in the headline index continued and a sharp increase
in the propensity to save in March further reinforced it, the agency
added.

"In February hopes were still high that consumer sentiment would recover
significantly with the foreseeable easing of pandemic-related
restrictions," Rolf Burkl, GfK consumer expert, said.  
  
"However, the start of the war in Ukraine caused these hopes to vanish
into thin air. Rising uncertainty and sanctions against Russia have
caused energy prices in particular to skyrocket, putting a noticeable
strain on general consumer sentiment."
