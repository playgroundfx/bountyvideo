The Bank of Japan maintained its massive monetary stimulus, as widely
expected, and extended the duration of the special funding programme to
help pandemic-hit firms.  
  
The board, governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, on Tuesday, voted 7-1, with 1
abstention, to hold the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current
accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

The Bank decided by an 8-0 majority vote, with 1 abstention, to extend
the duration of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to
the Novel Coronavirus by six months until the end of March 2022 with a
view to continuing to support financing, mainly of firms.

Further, the Bank judged it appropriate to introduce a new fund-
provisioning measure, through which it provides funds to financial
institutions for investment or loans that they make to address climate
change issues. The bank plans to launch the new measure likely within
2021.
