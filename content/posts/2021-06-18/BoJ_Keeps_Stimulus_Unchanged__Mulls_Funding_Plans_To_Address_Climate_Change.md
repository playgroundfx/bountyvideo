The Bank of Japan maintained its massive monetary stimulus and announced
the introduction of a new funding programme to support the efforts on
climate change issues and also extended the deadline for Covid support
programme.

The board, governed by Haruhiko Kuroda, on Tuesday, voted 7-1, with 1
abstention, to hold the interest rate at -0.1 percent on current
accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central bank.

The bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics, expects the BoJ to
leave both its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and target for 10-year government bond yields
unchanged for the foreseeable future.

The bank decided by an 8-0 majority vote, with 1 abstention, to extend
the duration of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to
the Novel Coronavirus.

The deadline for new loan application will end on March 2022 instead of
September 2021.

Further, the BoJ judged it appropriate to introduce a new fund-
provisioning measure, through which it provides funds to financial
institutions for investment or loans that they make to address climate
change issues.

The bank plans to launch the new measure likely within 2021. The
preliminary outline of the measure will be unveiled at the July monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting.

This new measure will be a successor to the Fund-Provisioning Measure to
Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth, BoJ said.
