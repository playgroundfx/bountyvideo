After reporting much stronger than expected job growth in the previous
month, the Labor Department released a report on Friday showing another
significant increase in U.S. employment in the month of February.

The report showed non-farm payroll employment spiked by 678,000 jobs in
February after surging by an upwardly revised 481,000 jobs in January.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 400,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 467,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The stronger than expected job growth was led by increases in employment
in the leisure and hospitality, professional and [business][1] services,
health care, and construction sectors.

With another jump in employment, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.8
percent in February from 4.0 percent in January.

The unemployment rate, which was expected to edge down to 3.9 percent,
fell to its lowest level since hitting 3.5 percent in February of 2020.

The bigger than expected decrease in the unemployment rate came as the
household measure of employment jumped by 548,000 jobs, while the labor
force increased by 304,000 persons.

The report also showed average hourly earnings inched up by a penny to
$31.58 in February. The annual rate of wage slowed to 5.1 percent in
February from 5.5 percent in January.

"The stronger than expected 678,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in
February and upward revisions to previous months gains is another sign
that the real [economy][2] has considerable momentum, with the Omicron
wave having surprisingly little impact," said Michael Pearce, Senior
U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "That will give the Fed greater confidence to push ahead with
its planned [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening but, with wage growth now leveling off,
there is arguably less pressure for officials to front-load an
aggressive series of rate hikes over the coming months."
