India's service sector growth increased in February, survey results from
IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.8 in February from
51.5 in January. Any score above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

"Growth in the service sector failed to rebound as meaningfully as many
would have hoped given that COVID-19 cases receded considerably from
January's new wave and restrictions were lifted," Pollyanna De Lima,
economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.

New [business][1] inflows increased in February and international demand
remained subdued.

The employment declined for the third straight month and was the fastest
since July last year.

Operating expenses increased in February and output price inflation
eased to the lowest in five months.

Outstanding business volume remained broadly unchanged in February and
business confidence strengthened expecting the pandemic will retreat and
will increase the focus on customer engagement.

The composite output index that combines the performance of
manufacturing and services, rose to 53.5 in February from 53.0 in the
previous month.
