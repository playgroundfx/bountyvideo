UK construction grew at the fastest pace in eight months in February,
led by stronger housing activity, defying expectations for a slowing,
survey data from IHS Markit showed Friday.

The CIPS/Markit purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for the construction
sector rose to 59.1 in February from 56.3 in January. Economists had
forecast a lower score of 54.3.

A reading above 50 suggests growth in the sector. The reading has now
remained above the threshold for 13 months.

Overall construction growth was underpinned by stronger client
confidence and work on new projects commencing.

House building emerged as the best performing category, replacing
commercial work, with the strongest growth in eight months.

Commercial construction grew at the sharpest rate since last July. Civil
engineering activity grew at the fastest pace since June 2021.

New order growth extended the current sequence of expansion to 21 months
and the rate of growth was the fastest since last August, on stronger
client demand in line with the recovery in economic activity and new
projects.

Input buying and hiring increased at faster rates in February.
Meanwhile, driver and material shortages as well as international
shipping issues led to delays.

Consequently, input prices rose further at a sharp rate, albeit the
weakest in 11 months, mainly due to rising raw material and commodity
prices amid supply shortages and a lack of transport capacity.

The near-term outlook for construction activity remained positive in
February, but the overall degree of optimism eased to the softest since
January 2021 as firms cited concerns about the impact of rising costs
and supply shortages.

"The highest rise in order books for six months didn't do enough to
improve future optimism as [business][1] expectations dropped to January
2021 levels," Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of
Procurement & Supply, said.

"Curbing inflation will continue to be a big issue for building firms
who will be nervous about securing continuing supply and offsetting
price rises to improve business margins, especially if costs continue
their skyward trajectory."
