Latvia's consumer prices declined for the second straight month in June,
figures from the Central Statistical Bureau showed on Wednesday.

Consumer prices decreased 0.7 percent year-on-year in June, following a
0.6 percent fall in May.

Prices of goods increased 6.8 percent annually in June and that of
services increased 14.1 percent.

The annual fall was driven by the weakness in transport, clothing and
footwear and housing. Meanwhile, food and non-alcohol beverages,
recreation and culture, [health][1] care, and restaurants and hotel
services increased.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in June.
