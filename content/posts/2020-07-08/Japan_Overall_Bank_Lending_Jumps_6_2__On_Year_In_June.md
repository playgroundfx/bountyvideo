The total value of overall bank lending in Japan was up 6.2 percent on
year in June, the Bank of Japan said on Wednesday - coming in at 570.111
trillion yen.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 7.2 percent following
the 4.8 percent gain in May.

Excluding trusts, bank lending rose an annual 6.5 percent to 497.758
trillion yen, accelerating from the 5.1 percent gain in the previous
month.

Lending from trusts gained 4.5 percent on year to 72.353 trillion yen,
up from 2.7 percent a month earlier. Lending from foreign banks jumped
10.1 percent to 3.242 trillion yen, slowing from 12.1 percent in May.
