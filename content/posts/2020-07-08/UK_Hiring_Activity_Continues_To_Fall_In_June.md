UK hiring activity continued to fall in June as clients continued to
freeze or cut back on their recruitment plans due to the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, the Report on Jobs compiled by IHS Markit
showed on Wednesday.

Both permanent staff placements and temporary billings decreased at
notably weaker rates than in April and May when the covid-19 pandemic
was at its most severe. However, rates of contraction remained sharp.

According to KPMG/REC report, the availability of workers grew at the
fastest pace since 2009 due to increased redundancies and workers who
were on furlough started seeking new jobs.

Starting pay for both permanent and short-term staff fell further in
June as demand for workers remained weak and labor supply continued to
increase. Further, demand for staff remained [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly weak in June.

James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG, said, the air of uncertainty around
the covid-19 pandemic will linger - and rebuilding confidence in the UK
jobs market will take time.
