UK new car registrations declined for the fourth consecutive month in
October amid semiconductor shortages, data from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, or SMMT, revealed on Thursday.

New car registrations decreased 24.6 percent year-on-year to 106,265
units in October.

Data showed that plug-in vehicles now account for 16.6 percent of all
cars registered so far in 2021.

Despite the strong performance in electrified vehicle registrations, the
overall market's monthly performance was the weakest seen since October
1991, the agency said.

Year-to-date, new car registrations were up 2.8 percent from the same
period last year.

Looking ahead, the latest SMMT forecast has been revised downward by
-8.8 percent to 1.66 million units, in light of the on-going supply
issues and deteriorating economic outlook.

Although this would see 2021 finish 1.9 percent or some 30,000 units up
on 2020, some 650,000 units down on 2019's pre-pandemic 2.3 million
performance.
