Norway's central bank left its key rate unchanged on Thursday and
signaled a rate hike in December.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee of Norges Bank
unanimously decided to keep the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate unchanged at 0.25 percent.

"Based on the Committee's current assessment of the outlook and balance
of risks, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised in December,"
Governor Ã˜ystein Olsen said.

The committee viewed that it will appropriate to raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate
further from today's level as the [economy][1] normalizes. Uncertainty
surrounding the effects of higher interest rates warrants a gradual rise
in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate.

The committee observed that global supply chain disruptions could dampen
the economic upturn and also contribute to higher inflation in Norway.

Looking ahead, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said higher economic activity and rising
wage growth will likely lift underlying inflation, but the recent krone
appreciation could curb the rise in prices.

The Norges Bank is all but certain to raise its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate by 25 basis
points to +0.50 percent, in December, David Oxley, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

The economist expects it to hike once per quarter next year which would
take the rate back to the pre-pandemic level of 1.50 percent by the end
of 2022.
