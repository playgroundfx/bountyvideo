Eurozone private sector expanded at the slowest pace in six months in
October as both manufacturers and service provides reported weaker
expansions, final data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The composite output index fell to 54.2 from 56.2 in September. The
flash reading was 54.3.

Growth at goods producers slowed to a particularly notable degree in
October as material shortages and supply bottlenecks squeezed
production. Meanwhile, activity growth hit a six-month low at service
providers as strong post-lockdown rates of expansion petered out.

The final services Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 54.6, down from
56.4 a month ago. The score was marginally below the flash level of
54.7.

Despite the slowdown, the rate of expansion remains consistent with
quarterly GDP growth of 0.5 percent, but there is a worrying lack of
clarity on the direction of travel in coming months, Chris Williamson,
chief [business][1] economist at IHS Markit said.

Germany recorded the softest increase in activity in October as both
monitored sectors logged slowed rises in output and new orders. The
final composite PMI declined to 52.0, as initially estimated, from 55.5
in September.

The services PMI dropped to 52.4, in line with the flash estimate, from
56.2 a month ago.

France's private sector expanded at the slowest pace in six months in
October. The survey showed a widening divergence between trends in the
French manufacturing and service sector in October.

The final composite output index declined to 54.7 from 55.3 in the
previous month. The reading matched the flash estimate. The final
services PMI slid to 56.6, as initially estimated, from 56.2 a month
ago.

The survey showed a ninth successive monthly upturn in Italian private
sector output. That said, the latest reading was the lowest since April.
The composite output index fell to 54.2 in October from 56.6 in
September.

At 52.4, the services PMI registered the weakest level in the current
six-month sequence of expansion, and down from 55.5 in September and
below the expected score of 54.5.

Spain's private sector growth continued its downward trend, softening
for a fourth month in a row to reach its lowest since April. The
composite output index fell to 56.2 from 57.0 in the previous month.

The services PMI came in at 56.6, down from 56.9 a month ago. However,
the score was above economists' forecast of 55.8.
