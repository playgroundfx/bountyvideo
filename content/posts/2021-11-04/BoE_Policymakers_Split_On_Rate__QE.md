Policymakers of the Bank of England decided to maintain its record low
interest rate and quantitative easing in a split vote.

Seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to leave the key
interest rate unchanged at 0.10 percent, while Dave Ramsden and Michael
Saunders sought a 15 basis point rate hike, the bank said in a statement
on Thursday.  
  
Ramsden and Saunders said the economic outlook warranted a tightening in
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance at this meeting.

Further, the MPC voted 6-3 to retain the existing stock of corporate
bond purchases at GBP 20 billion and the government bond purchases
target at GBP 875 billion.

Catherine L Mann, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders preferred to reduce
the target for the stock of UK government bond purchases to GBP 855
billion from GBP 875 billion.

The MPC judged that it would be necessary over coming months to increase
Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2 percent
target.

According to the latest forecast, CPI inflation will rise to 4.5 percent
in November and remain around that level through the winter, accounted
for by further increases in core goods and food price inflation.

Overall, GDP was expected to grow by around 1.5 percent in third quarter
of 2021 and by 1 percent in the fourth quarter in the November Report
projections, around half of the rates envisaged in the August Report.

As a result, GDP was expected to remain below its pre-Covid level until
the first quarter of 2022.
