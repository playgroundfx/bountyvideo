A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a steep
drop in U.S. labor productivity in the third quarter.

The Labor Department said labor productivity tumbled by 5.0 percent in
the third quarter after surging by an upwardly revised 2.4 percent in
the second quarter.

Economists had expected labor productivity to decrease by 1.5 percent
compared to the 2.1 percent jump that had been reported for the previous
quarter.

The sharp pullback in productivity, a measure of output per hour, came
as output increased by 1.7 percent compared to a 7.0 percent spike in
hours worked.

Meanwhile, the report showed unit labor costs soared by 8.3 percent in
the third quarter after climbing by a downwardly revised 1.1 percent in
the second quarter.

Labor costs were expected to shoot up by 5.2 percent compared to the 1.3
percent increase that had been reported for the previous quarter.

The spike in unit labor costs reflected the steep drop in productivity
as well as a 2.9 percent jump in hourly compensation.

However, the Labor Department said real hourly compensation, which takes
changes in consumer prices into account, slumped by 3.5 percent.

"We look for productivity growth to stay upbeat in the near-term even as
the labor market recovery heats up and the [economy][1] maintains solid
momentum," said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Farther ahead, we expect a mix of factors - a strong
investment cycle, increased [business][2] dynamism, faster technology
adoption, and lasting remote work - to power above-trend productivity
growth in the post-Covid era."
