Germany factory orders recovered in September but at a slower-than-
expected pace, figures from Destatis revealed on Thursday.

New orders grew 1.3 percent month-on-month in September, reversing an
8.8 percent decrease in August. However, this was slower than the 2
percent expansion expected by economists.

Domestic orders were down 5.9 percent in September on the previous
month. Meanwhile, foreign orders rose 6.3 percent.

On a yearly basis, new order growth eased to 9.7 percent from 10.4
percent in August.

Further, data showed that manufacturing turnover dropped 0.3 percent,
following a revised 5.8 percent fall in August.
