Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers decided to maintain the record low interest
rate and quantitative easing in a split vote and signaled a rate hike
over the coming months as inflation remains stubbornly above the target.

Seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to leave the key
interest rate unchanged at 0.10 percent, while Dave Ramsden and Michael
Saunders sought a 15 basis point rate hike, the bank said in a statement
on Thursday.

Ramsden and Saunders said the economic outlook warranted a tightening in
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance at this meeting.

Markets expected a 15 basis point rate hike at the meeting after
Governor Andrew Bailey recently commented that the bank will have to act
on inflation.

Further, the MPC decided to retain the existing stock of corporate bond
purchases at GBP 20 billion and the government bond purchases target at
GBP 875 billion.

Catherine Mann, Ramsden and Saunders preferred to reduce the target for
the stock of UK government bond purchases to GBP 855 billion from GBP
875 billion.

Dissenting members said a decision to tighten [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at this meeting
would reduce the risk of medium-term inflation expectations drifting up,
which might otherwise ultimately necessitate a more abrupt subsequent
tightening in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and hence a greater adjustment in growth and
employment.

The MPC judged that it would be necessary over the coming months to
increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2
percent target.

Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said the bank sent a
strong signal that it is unlikely to raise rates to the level of 1.00
percent that is fully priced into [markets][1] by the end of next year.
The economist expects rate to end next year at 0.50 percent.

According to the latest BoE forecast, CPI inflation will rise to 4.5
percent in November and remain around that level through the winter,
accounted for by further increases in core goods and food price
inflation.

Inflation is expected to peak at around 5 percent in April 2022,
materially higher than expected in the August Report.

Price growth is projected to fall back materially from the second half
of next year as supply disruption eases, global demand rebalances and
energy prices stop rising.

Overall, GDP was expected to have grown by around 1.5 percent in the
third quarter of this year, and to expand by 1 percent in the fourth
quarter in the November Report projections, around half of the rates
envisaged in the August Report.

As a result, GDP was expected to remain below its pre-Covid level until
the first quarter of 2022.
