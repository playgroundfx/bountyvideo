South Korea had a current account surplus of $10.07 billion in
September, the Bank of Korea said on Friday - up from 7.51 billion in
August.

The goods account surplus decreased to $9.45 billion, compared to the
$12.11 billion figure in September 2020.

The services account deficit decreased to $0.02 billion, from $2.08
billion in September last year, owing to an improvement in the transport
account.

The primary income account surplus increased from $0.69 billion the year
previously to $0.75 billion in September 2021.
