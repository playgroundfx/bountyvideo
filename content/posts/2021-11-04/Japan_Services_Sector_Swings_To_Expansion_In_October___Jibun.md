The services sector in Japan moved into expansion territory in October,
the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on Thursday with a services
PMI scire of 50.7.

That's up from 47.6 in September and it moves above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Japanese services companies reported an increase in [business][1]
activity for the first time since the start of last year in October.
Activity returned to expansion territory for the first time since
January 2020, as COVID-19 restrictions were eased amid a reduction in
infections.

Moreover, firms reported a third consecutive increase in employment
levels as demand gradually recovered from the disruption caused by the
pandemic. As a result, service providers were increasingly confident
that business conditions would recover in the year ahead.

The survey also showed that the composite index improved from 47.9 in
September to 50.7 in October.

Japanese services firms recorded growth in activity for the first time
since January 2020, while manufacturers reversed the decline noted in
September. The 12-month outlook for output reached a series high in
October (since 2012).
