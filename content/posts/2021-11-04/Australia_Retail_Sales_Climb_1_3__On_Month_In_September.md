The total value of retail sales in Australia was up a seasonally
adjusted 1.3 percent on month in September, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Thursday - coming in at A$29.669 billion.

That was in line with expectations following the 1.7 percent decline in
August.

Individually, sales were up for household goods, clothing, other
retailing and cafes and restaurants; sales were down for food and
department store retailing.

On a yearly basis, sales were up 1.7 percent.

For the third quarter of 2021, retail sales fell 4.4 percent on quarter
and 2.2 percent on year to A$85.348 billion.
