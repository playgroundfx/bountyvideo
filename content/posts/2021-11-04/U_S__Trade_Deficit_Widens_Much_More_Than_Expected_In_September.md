Reflecting a sharp pullback in the value of exports, the Commerce
Department released a report on Thursday showing the U.S. trade deficit
widened much more than expected in the month of September.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $80.9 billion
in September from a revised $72.8 billion in August.

Economists had expected the deficit to widen to $74.1 billion from the
$73.3 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider than expected trade deficit came as the value of exports
tumbled by 3.0 percent to $207.6 billion, while the value of imports
rose by 0.6 percent to $288.5 billion.
