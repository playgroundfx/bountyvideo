The average of household spending in Japan was down 1.9 percent on year
in September, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said
on Friday - coming in at 265,306 yen.

That beat forecasts for a drop of 3.9 percent following the 3.0 percent
decline in August.

On a monthly basis, household spending jumped 5.0 percent - again
exceeding expectations for a gain of 2.8 percent following the 3.9
percent drop in the previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 481,800 yen, up 2.5
percent on year.
