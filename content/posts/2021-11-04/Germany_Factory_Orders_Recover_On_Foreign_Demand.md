Germany factory orders recovered in September underpinned by robust
foreign demand, figures from Destatis revealed on Thursday.

New orders grew 1.3 percent month-on-month in September, reversing an
8.8 percent decrease in August. However, this was slower than the 2
percent expansion expected by economists.

Domestic orders were down 5.9 percent in September. By contrast, foreign
orders rose 6.3 percent. New orders from the euro area decreased 7.3
percent and that from other countries moved up 14.9 percent.

Producers of intermediate goods reported a 2.0 percent fall in new
orders. On the other hand, the producers of capital goods recorded an
increase of 3.9 percent. Regarding consumer goods, orders were down 1.7
percent.

In September, new orders increased most considerably in the manufacture
of machinery and equipment by 12.2 percent, where comprehensive major
orders were reported. A 9.6 percent increase in new orders was recorded
in the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers.

On a yearly basis, new order growth eased to 9.7 percent from 10.4
percent in August.

Further, data showed that manufacturing turnover dropped 0.3 percent,
following a revised 5.8 percent fall in August. Year-on-year, real
turnover was 2.9 percent lower.
