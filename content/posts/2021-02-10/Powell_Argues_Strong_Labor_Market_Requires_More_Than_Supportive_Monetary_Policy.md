Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that maintaining
"patiently accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)" will be important to returning
to a strong labor market but argued more needs to be done.

Powell cautioned during remarks at a virtual Economic Club of New York
event that the U.S. is still "very far" from a strong labor market
despite the recovery seen since the early days of the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic.

The published unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent in January, but
Powell said the actual number was close to 10 percent when factoring in
misclassifications by the Labor Department as well as those who have
left the labor force since last February.

"So how do we get from where we are today back to a strong labor market
that benefits all Americans and that starts to heal the damage already
done? And what can we do to sustain those benefits over time?" Powell
asked.

The Fed chief said policies that bring the pandemic to an end as soon as
possible are "paramount" while also citing the need to provide continued
support for workers and households who struggle to find their place in
the post-pandemic [economy][2].

"Also important is a patiently accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance that
embraces the lessons of the pastâ€”about the labor market in particular
and the economy more generally," Powell said.

Powell reiterated that the Fed intends to keep interest rates at near-
zero levels until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent
with maximum employment and inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2
percent for some time.

However, Powell argued achieving and sustaining maximum employment will
require more than supportive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

"It will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from
across government and the private sector," Powell said as he concluded
his remarks.

He added, "I am confident that with our collective efforts across the
government and the private sector, our nation will make sustained
progress toward our national goal of maximum employment."
