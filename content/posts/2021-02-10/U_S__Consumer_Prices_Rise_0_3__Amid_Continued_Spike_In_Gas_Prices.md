With gasoline prices continuing to spike, the Labor Department released
a report on Wednesday showing consumer prices in the U.S. increased in
line with economist estimates in the month of January.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.3 percent
in January after edging up by a revised 0.2 percent in December.

Economists had expected consumer prices to climb by 0.3 percent compared
to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The consumer price growth was primarily due to the continued jump in
gasoline prices, which soared by 7.4 percent in January after surging up
by 5.2 percent in December.

Higher gasoline prices contributed to a 3.5 percent increase by the
energy index even though prices for electricity and natural gas
declined.

The report also showed a slight increase in food prices, which inched up
by 0.1 percent in January, as an advance in prices for food away from
home more than offset a dip in prices for food at home.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices came in unchanged
for the second consecutive month. Economists had expected core prices to
rise by 0.2 percent.

The Labor Department said higher prices for apparel, medical care,
shelter, and motor vehicle insurance were offset by lower prices for
recreation, used cars and trucks, airline fares, and new vehicles.

Compared to the same month a year ago, consumer prices in January were
up by 1.4 percent, unchanged from the annual growth seen in December.

Meanwhile, the annual rate of growth in core prices slowed to 1.4
percent in January from 1.6 percent in the previous month.

"Looking ahead, inflation is poised to rise above 2% in the spring, but
this will be driven largely by easy base effects and should be
transitory," said Kathy Bostjancic, Chief U.S. Financial Economist at
Oxford Economics.

She added, "Thus, the Federal Reserve should patiently look past this
increase and delay rate liftoff until mid-2023 and QE tapering until
2022."

Next Wednesday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on producer price inflation in the month of January.

Economists currently expect producer prices to rise by 0.4 percent,
while core producer prices are expected to edge up by 0.2 percent.
