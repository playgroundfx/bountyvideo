Consumer prices in China were up 1.0 percent on month in January, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday - in line with
expectations following the 0.7 percent increase in December.

On a yearly basis, consumer prices fell 0.3 percent - shy of
expectations for a flat reading following the 0.2 percent gain in the
previous month.

The bureau also said that producer prices rose 0.3 percent on year in
January - missing forecasts for an increase of 0.4 percent after sinking
0.4 percent a month earlier.
