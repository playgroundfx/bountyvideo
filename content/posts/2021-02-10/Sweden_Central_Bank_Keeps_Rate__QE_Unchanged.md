Sweden's central bank maintained its key interest rate and the asset
purchase programme, in order to facilitate the recovery and bring
inflation back to the target.

The Executive Board of Riksbank decided to hold the repo rate at zero
percent. The rate is projected to remain at this level in the years to
come.

The board also kept the envelope of the asset purchase programme
unchanged at SEK 700 billion.

The executive board estimated that the envelope for asset purchases will
be fully utilized by the end of 2021 and that the size of the holdings
will be maintained on this level at least during 2022.

The bank vowed to formulate the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) so that it supports the
recovery and inflation as long as necessary.

A further extension to the quantitative easing programme is possible
later in the year, particularly if the downside risks surrounding the
virus materialise - though a return to negative rates remains unlikely,
James Smith and Petr Krpata, economists at ING said.

The bank upgraded its inflation forecast for both 2021 and 2022 to 1.3
percent, from 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.

Riksbank observed that the economic developments in 2021 will be largely
determined by how quickly and effectively vaccinations reduce the
pandemic.

The growth outlook for 2021 was raised to 3 percent from 2.6 percent but
that for 2022 was lowered to 3.9 percent from 5 percent.
