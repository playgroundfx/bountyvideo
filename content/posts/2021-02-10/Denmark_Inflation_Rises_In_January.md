Denmark's consumer prices rose in January, data from Statistics Denmark
showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 0.6 percent year-on-year in January,
following a 0.5 percent increase in December.

The consumer price index for January is affected by Covid-19, as the
drop in price observations remained larger than normal, the agency said.

Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco increased the most by 17.4
percent in January, mainly due to higher prices for tobacco.

Clothing and footwear cost had the largest decline of 3.7 percent, due
to the winter sale on clothing.

Core inflation, which excludes prices of energy and fresh food, rose to
1.1 percent in January from 1.0 percent in the previous month.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in January.
