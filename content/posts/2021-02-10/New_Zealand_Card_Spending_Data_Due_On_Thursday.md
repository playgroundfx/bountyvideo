New Zealand will on Thursday release January numbers for electronic
retail card spending, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity. In December, retail card spending was up 19.2 percent on month
and 3.5 percent on year.

Australia will see February's inflation forecast from the Melbourne
Institute; in January, the forecast suggested an increase of 3.4 percent
on year.

Also, several of the regional bourses are closed on Thursday for the
Lunar New Year, including South Korea, Taiwan and China. Japan is also
shuttered in observance of National Foundation Day.
