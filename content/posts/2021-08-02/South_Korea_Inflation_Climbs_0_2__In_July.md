Consumer prices in South Korea were up a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent
on month in July, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.

That exceeded expectations for a flat reading following the 0.1 percent
decline in June.

On a yearly basis, inflation climbed 2.6 percent - again beating
forecasts for 2.4 percent, which would have been unchanged.

Core CPI was up 0.4 percent on month following the flat reading in June;
it was steady at 1.2 percent on year.
