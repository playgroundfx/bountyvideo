The pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in
the month of July, according to a report released by the Institute for
Supply Management on Monday.

The ISM said its manufacturing PMI dipped to 59.5 in July from 60.6 in
June. While a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the
manufacturing sector, economists had expected the index to inch up to
60.9.

With the unexpected decrease, the manufacturing PMI pulled back further
off the 37-year high of 64.7 reached in March and fell to its lowest
level since hitting 58.7 in January.

Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey
Committee, noted panelists reported that their companies and suppliers
continue to struggle to meet increasing demand levels.

"As we enter the third quarter, all segments of the manufacturing
[economy][1] are impacted by near record-long raw-material lead times,
continued shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodities
prices and difficulties in transporting products." Fiore said.

He added, "Worker absenteeism, short-term shutdowns due to parts
shortages and difficulties in filling open positions continue to be
issues limiting manufacturing-growth potential."

The unexpected decrease by the headline index came as the production
index slid to 58.4 in July from 60.8 in June, while the new orders index
fell to 64.9 from 66.0.

The supplier deliveries index dropped to 72.5 in July from 75.1 in June,
although a reading above 50 still indicates slower deliveries.

The report showed the prices index also tumbled to 85.7 in July after
reaching a more than forty-year high of 92.1 in June.

On the other hand, the ISM said the employment index jumped to 52.9 in
July from 49.9 in June, indicating a return to job growth in the
manufacturing sector.

"The details suggest supplier delivery times and the accompanying upward
pressure on prices are no longer getting any worse, but we suspect it
will be a long time before those supply constraints ease meaningfully,"
said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

The ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on Wednesday regarding
activity in the service sector in the month of July. The services PMI is
expected to inch up to 60.4 in July from 60.1 in June.
