The Dutch manufacturing sector growth slowed in July, but the pace of
expansion remained strong, survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Monday.

The NEVI manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, decreased to
67.4 in July from 68.8 in June. Any reading above 50.0 indicates
expansion in the sector.

New orders volume accelerated in July and output rose at the slowest
rate in four months.

Employment increased further in July and suppliers' delivery time
lengthened.

For the next 12 months, confidence remained positive and sentiment eased
to the lowest in five months.

On the price font, the rate of input price inflation rose to a record
high and output price inflation remained broadly unchanged.
