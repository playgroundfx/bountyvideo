China's manufacturing sector logged its weakest growth in more than a
year in July largely due to a fall in new orders, survey data published
by IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Caixin general manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to
50.3 in July from 51.3 in June. The reading was below economists'
forecast of 51.0.

Although a score above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector, the index
signaled the slowest growth for 15 months.  
  
According to the official survey data, released over the weekend, the
manufacturing PMI fell to 50.4 in July from 50.9 a month ago. The non-
manufacturing PMI came in at 53.3, down from 53.5 in June.

New [business][1] dropped for the first time in 14 months in July as
higher factory gate prices dampened customer demand, survey data from
IHS Markit revealed. New export orders rose only slightly as the
pandemic continued to hinder sales overseas.

The output growth softened for the third month in a row. The latest
increase was the slowest seen for 16 months. Supply chain delays
persisted in July, with average delivery times for inputs increasing
solidly, the survey showed.

Employment levels were little-changed in July, after a slight uptick in
payroll numbers in June.

On the price front, the survey showed that inflationary pressures
softened in July. Input prices rose at the weakest rate since November
2020. The rate of output charge inflation likewise slowed in July, with
selling prices rising only slightly overall.

Manufacturers were generally optimistic that output would increase over
the next year. However, the level of confidence slipped to a three-month
low in July.

The latest survey readings reinforce the assessment that the
[economy][2] will tread water during the second half of the year, Julian
Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said. Although this
would mean a faster slowdown than most anticipate, it should not be
cause for alarm given how strong activity has been recently.
