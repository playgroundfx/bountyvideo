Germany's retail sales growth exceeded expectations in June as the
relaxation of restrictions related to the pandemic supported consumer
demand, data from Destatis revealed on Monday.

Retail sales grew 4.2 percent month-on-month in June, much faster than
the economists' forecast of 2 percent. Nonetheless, the latest increase
was slower than the 4.6 percent growth logged in May.

On a yearly basis, retail turnover advanced 6.2 percent, in contrast to
the 1.8 percent drop in May and economists' forecast of -2.2 percent.

Food, beverages and tobacco sales gained 1.4 percent and non-food
turnover climbed 9 percent.

Compared to February 2020, the month before the crisis, sales in June
were in real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) 9.1 percent higher.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales gained 4.6 percent on month taking the
annual growth to 8.2 percent in June.
