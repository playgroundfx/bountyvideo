Poland's manufacturing sector grew at a softer pace in July, survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, fell to 57.6 in
July from 59.4 in June. Economists had forecast a score of 59.0.

A PMI reading above 50 suggests growth in the manufacturing sector.

New orders rose for the eight month in a row in July and new export
[business][1] growth eased.

Output increased for the sixth straight month and backlogs of work rose
for the tenth month in a row in July.

Output expectations remained positive in July, but was the weakest in
three months.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened for the eighth consecutive month in
July and employment increased further.

On the price font, input price inflation and output prices rose to the
third-highest on record.
