Spain's manufacturing sector growth moderated to a three-month low in
July, survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.  
  
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 59.0 in July from
60.4 in June.  
Although the score dropped moderately in July, the index suggested
another strong improvement in operating conditions.

Production and new order book growth remained considerable in July amid
reports that market demand had improved. Nonetheless, production and new
orders grew at slower rates when compared to recent peaks.

Jobs were added at a decent rate, with firms scrambling to bolster
production capabilities to match workloads.

Price inflation remained elevated, and was a factor depressing
confidence about the future, the survey showed.

Firms remained positive overall that sales and output will rise further
in the coming 12 months, with confidence remaining comfortably in
positive territory despite dropping to a half-year low.
