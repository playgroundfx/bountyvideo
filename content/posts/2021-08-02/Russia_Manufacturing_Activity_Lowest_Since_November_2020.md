Russia's manufacturing activity deteriorated to the lowest since
November last year amid weak client demand, survey data from IHS Markit
showed on Monday.

The IHS Markit Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
fell to 47.5 in July from 49.2 in June. A PMI reading below 50 signals
contraction in the sector.

Production dropped for the first time in seven months in July and new
orders fell for the second straight month.

New export orders fell for the sixth time in seven months.

The rate of cost inflation was the slowest in ten months in July.
Selling prices increased further.

Degree of confidence improved, but a softer pace and was the lowest in
nine months, due to new product development and hopes of greater client
demand.

Backlogs of work declined further in July and the rate of job shedding
accelerated to the fastest since November last year.

"The Bank of Russia recently noted that the [economy][1] had returned to
pre-pandemic levels, with our latest forecast expecting industrial
production to rise 6.1 percent on the year in 2021," Sian Jones, senior
economist at IHS Markit, said.
