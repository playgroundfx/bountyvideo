The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in July,
although at a slower rate, the latest survey from the Australian
Industry Group showed on Monday with a Performance of Manufacturing
Index score of 60.8.

That's down from 63.2 in June, although it remains well above the boom-
or-but line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This indicated strong but decelerating growth for manufacturing activity
in June, despite widespread lockdowns. This was the tenth consecutive
month of recovery for the Australian PMI following the severe
disruptions of COVID-19 in 2020.

The machinery & equipment, metal products and chemicals manufacturing
sectors all reached record highs in July. A new high was also recorded
for the input price index in July. Respondents attributed surging
activity and prices to strong demand for manufactured products that
supply the construction, mining, agricultural and transport sectors.
