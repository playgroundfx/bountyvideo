The Reserve Bank of Australia will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting
on Tuesday and then announce its decision on interest rates,
highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The RBA is
widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate steady at 0.20
percent.

Australia also will release June figures for building permits and home
loans; in May, building permits were down 7.1 percent on month and home
loans were up 1.9 percent on month.

Japan will see July numbers for Tokyo inflation; in June, overall and
core inflation were both flat on year.

South Korea will provide July figures for consumer prices, with
forecasts calling for a flat monthly reading and an increase of 2.4
percent on year. That follows the 0.1 percent monthly decline and the
2.4 percent yearly gain in June.

Thailand will see July results for its [business][1] confidence index;
in June, the index score was 46.2.
