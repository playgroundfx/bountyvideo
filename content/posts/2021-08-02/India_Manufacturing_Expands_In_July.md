India's manufacturing sector expanded at the strongest pace in three
months in July, amid a rebound in production and demand that led to an
increase in hiring for the first time in over a year.

The headline manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to
55.3 in July from 48.1 in June, survey results from IHS Markit showed on
Monday.

Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Factory orders improved in July amid a sharp increase in demand from
abroad.

Output and sales increased in July. Employment rose at a softer pace and
ended in a fifteen-month sequence of job shedding.

Purchase of stocks increased in July. Backlogs of work rose and
suppliers' delivery time lengthened.

Input prices rose in July and output charges increased at a softer rate.

"Hence, we expect the RBI to keep interest rates unchanged in its August
meeting as it continues to support growth," Pollyanna De Lima, economics
associate director at IHS Markit, said.

Positive sentiment improved in July and firms foresee output growth in
the next 12 months.
