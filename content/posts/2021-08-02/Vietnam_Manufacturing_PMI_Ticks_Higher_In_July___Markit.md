The manufacturing sector in Vietnam continued to contract in July,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 45.1.

That's up from 44.1 in June, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Some firms have been forced to close temporarily, while others are
having to operate with reduced capacity due to social distancing
measures.

These effects, alongside a marked drop in new orders, resulted in a
further sharp reduction in manufacturing production at the start of the
third quarter. The decline in output was softer only than those seen
following the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and
April last year.
