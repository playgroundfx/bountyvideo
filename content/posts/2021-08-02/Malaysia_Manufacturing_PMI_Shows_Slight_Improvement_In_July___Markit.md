The manufacturing sector in Malaysia continued to contract in July,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 40.1.

That's up from 39.9 in June, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Survey gauges of both output and new orders signaled further marked
reductions in July. The former saw the rate of decrease quicken from
June to reach the fastest since the first wave of the pandemic in April
2020.

Companies reported that renewed pandemic restrictions dampened demand
and client confidence in both domestic and international [markets][1].
