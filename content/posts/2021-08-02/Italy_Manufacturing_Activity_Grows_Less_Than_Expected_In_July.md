Italy's manufacturing activity grew less than expected in July, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index dropped to 60.3 in July
from 62.2 in June. The score was forecast to fall 61.5.

Nonetheless, the latest reading was the fourth highest on record and
pointed to a rapid improvement in the [health][1] of the manufacturing
sector.

There were rapid upturns in output and new orders but the pace softened
from June. Firms raised their employment at the joint fourth quickest on
record.

Inflationary pressures remained severe in July. Input prices rose at the
second quickest pace on record. In response, firms increased their
average charges at the steepest rate in the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Firms remained upbeat towards the year-ahead outlook for output.
Nonetheless, the level of sentiment moderated to a 15-month low.
