Eurozone monetary aggregate and private sector credit grew at faster
rates in March, the European Central Bank reported Wednesday.

The monetary aggregate M3 expanded at a pace of 7.5 percent annually in
March, following a 5.5 percent rise in February. The rate was forecast
to remain unchanged at 5.5 percent.

Likewise, growth in narrow measure, M1 advanced to 10.3 percent from 8.1
percent a month ago.

Data showed that annual growth in credit to private sector improved to
4.2 percent in March from 3.4 percent in February.

Likewise, the adjusted loans to the private sector increased to 5
percent from 3.7 percent. However, growth in loans to households eased
to 3.4 percent from 3.7 percent. Meanwhile, loans to non-financial
corporations accelerated to 5.4 percent from 3 percent.

Monetary conditions have loosened significantly because of the ECB
measures, which should help fend off the crisis although it is unlikely
to result in more economic activity in the immediate lockdown phase,
Bert Colijn, an ING economist said.

The question now is whether the permanent damage can be contained with
the monetary response in place, the economist added.
