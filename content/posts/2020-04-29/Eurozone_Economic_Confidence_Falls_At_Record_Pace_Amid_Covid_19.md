Eurozone economic confidence deteriorated at the fastest pace on record
in April amid the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic, survey
results from the European Commission showed Wednesday.  
  
The economic confidence index fell to 67.0 in April from 94.2 in March.
This was the strongest monthly decline since 1985, and the reading
reached near the lowest levels seen during the Great Recession in March
2009.  
  
Among sectors, the crash was particularly marked in services and retail
trade.

The industrial sentiment index plunged to -30.4 from -11.2 a month ago.
The steepest monthly fall on record resulted first and foremost from
managers' crashing production expectations, the survey showed.  
  
The services confidence index slid to a record -35.0 from -2.3 largely
due to record-breaking deterioration in expected demand and in the
assessment of the past [business][2] situation and past demand.

Likewise, the retail trade confidence fell sharply to -28.3 from -8.6 as
there was exceptionally strong deterioration in retailers' business
expectations.

The consumer sentiment indicator came in at -22.7, in line with the
flash estimate, versus -11.6 in the previous month. The stark decline
was fueled by households' tumbling expectations concerning the general
economic situation and also their own financial situation.

The construction sentiment indicator declined to -12.8 from +2.3 a month
ago. The slump reflected managers' marked corrections to their
employment expectations and assessments of the level of order books.

At -1.81, the business climate index hit the lowest level since December
2009.

The employment expectations indicator plummeted 30.1 points to 63.7 in
April, the lowest level on record.  
  
Bert Colijn, an ING economist, said the biggest concern indicated by the
survey is the rapid decline in employment expectations for both industry
and services.

Prospects for the coming months are dismal despite announcements of
cautious lockdown loosening, the economist added.

Elsewhere, data from the European Central Bank suggested that monetary
conditions have loosened significantly. The monetary aggregate M3
expanded at a pace of 7.5 percent annually in March, following a 5.5
percent rise in February.

Annual growth in credit to private sector improved to 4.2 percent from
3.4 percent a month ago.
