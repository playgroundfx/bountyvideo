Fitch Ratings on Tuesday downgraded Italy's credit ratings citing the
significant impact of [coronavirus][1], or covid-19, pandemic on the
fiscal position of the [economy][2].

The ratings were lowered to 'BBB-', a notch above the junk status. The
outlook was stable.

Fitch forecast the economy to contract 8 percent this year and the risks
to the forecast are tilted to the downside as it assumed that the
coronavirus can be contained in the second half of 2020, leading to a
strong recovery next year.

However, in the event of a second wave of infections and the widespread
resumption of lockdown measures, economic outturns would be weaker for
2020 and 2021, the agency observed.

The gross general government debt is forecast to rise to 156 percent of
GDP by at the end of 2020, compared with the 'BBB' current median of 36
percent of GDP.

The agency lowered Italy's ratings ahead of its scheduled review in
July.

The 'stable' outlook partly reflects the view that the ECB's net asset
purchases will facilitate Italy's substantial fiscal response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and ease refinancing risks by keeping borrowing costs
at very low levels at least over the near term.
