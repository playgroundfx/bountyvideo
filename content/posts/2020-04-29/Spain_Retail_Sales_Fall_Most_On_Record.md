Spain retail sales logged a double-digit record decline in March as
measures to contain the spread of [coronavirus][1], or covid-19, weighed
on non-food product turnover, data from the statistical office INE
showed Wednesday.

Retail sales declined by an adjusted 14.1 percent on a yearly basis,
reversing a 1.8 percent rise in February. This was the biggest decline
on record.

On an adjusted basis, retail sales decreased 14.3 percent after rising
5.5 percent in February.

Month-on-month, retail sales fell for the first time in three months.
Sales were down 15.3 percent, reversing a 0.3 percent rise a month ago.

Food sales advanced 8.4 percent on month, while non-food sales declined
sharply by 32 percent in March.
