Wednesday. That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.2 percent and
was down from 0.7 percent in the three months prior.

On a yearly basis, inflation climbed 2.2 percent - again topping
forecasts for 2.0 percent and up from 1.8 percent in Q4.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's trimmed mean was up 0.5 percent on
quarter and 1.8 percent on year following the 0.4 percent quarterly
increase and the 1.6 percent yearly gain in the previous three months.

The RBA's weighted median was up 0.5 percent on quarter and 1.7 percent
on year after adding 0.4 percent on quarter and 1.3 percent on year in
the fourth quarter.
