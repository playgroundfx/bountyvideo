The U.S. Federal Reserve today held its interest rate target between 0
percent and 0.25 percent.

The Fed said it would continue with its aggressive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance until
it is comfortable that the [economy][1] is back on its feet.

The Federal Open Market Committee said in its post-meeting statement
that the ongoing public [health][2] crisis "will weigh heavily on
economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term," and pose
considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.

"The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is
confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track
to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals," the
statement reads.

Noting bleak conditions across multiple sectors of the economy, the Fed
said, "The [coronavirus][3] outbreak is causing tremendous human and
economic hardship across the United States and around the world," the
post-meeting statement said.

"The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing
sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker
demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer
price inflation," the statement continued. "The disruptions to economic
activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial
conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and
businesses."

In his post-meet press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said "Medium
term risks means over next year or so, primarily length of time to
control virus. The risks also involve potential damage to economy,
workers, if levels of unemployment remain high for an extended time."

"Damage could also be done if small businesses are harmed by unnecessary
insolvencies," he said.

Powell also said that global dimension also poses risks that could weigh
on US performance over time and said economic activity will start to
pick up as reopening begins but will take some time to get back to more
normal levels of unemployment.
