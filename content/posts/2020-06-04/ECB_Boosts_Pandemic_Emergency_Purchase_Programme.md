The European Central Bank on Thursday increased the size of its
emergency asset purchase programme and maintained its commitment to ease
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance further if needed, as the euro area faces its worst
recession in decades due to the impact of the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, pandemic.

The central bank left its key interest rates unchanged as expected.

The Governing Council decided to increase the size of the pandemic
emergency purchase programme, or PEPP, by EUR 600 billion to a total EUR
1,350 billion, the bank said in a statement.

This expansion will further ease the general monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance and
support funding conditions in the real [economy][2], especially for
businesses and households, the ECB said.
