Covid-19 pandemic, figures from the National Institute of Statistics
showed on Thursday.

Retail sales dropped a working-day adjusted 18.5 percent year-on-year in

Sale of motor vehicles in specialized stores declined 37.7 percent
annually in April. Sales of non-food products fell 21.6 percent and
food, beverages and tobacco decreased 5.0 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, retail sales fell 22.3 percent in April,
following a 3.4 percent decrease in the preceding month.

On an unadjusted basis, retail sales declined 19.5 percent annually in
April and fell 19.7 percent from the prior month.
