New Zealand commodity prices continued to fall in May but the pace of
decline slowed notably from April, data from the ANZ showed Thursday.

The ANZ commodity price index dropped 0.1 percent on month, slower than
the 1.1 percent decrease seen in April.

On a yearly basis, commodity prices decreased 9.3 percent, following a
9.2 percent fall in April.

In local currency [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), commodity prices slid 1.3 percent from April
and 2.6 percent from the same period last year.

The ANZ said commodity prices have held up extremely well so far given
the global market volatility, but prices are expected to ease in the
months ahead.
