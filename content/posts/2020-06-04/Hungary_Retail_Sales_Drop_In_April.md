Hungary's retail sales dropped in April, due to the impact of the
Covid-19 pandemic, figures from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office
showed on Thursday.

Retail sales dropped by a [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)-adjusted 10.2 percent year-on-year in
April, after a 3.5 percent increase in March.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, regulatory restrictions were introduced,
which also affected retailing, with an impact on the turnover of all
[business][1] types, the agency said.

Sales of non-food products declined 14.8 percent annually in April.
Sales of automotive fuels declined 26.3 percent and those of non-
specialized food shops fell 0.4 percent.

The volume of mail order and internet retailing, which accounted for
12.5 percent of all retail sales and involved a wide range of goods,
rose by 104 percent year-on-year in April, continuing a multi-year
expansion, the agency said.

On a non-adjusted basis, retail sales declined 10.2 percent annually in
April, after a 4.4 percent increase in the previous month.
