The European Central Bank on Thursday increased the size of its
emergency asset purchase programme and maintained its commitment to ease
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance further if needed, as the euro area faces its worst
recession in decades due to the impact of the [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, pandemic.  
  
The central bank left its key interest rates unchanged as expected.  
  
"The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its
instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its
aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry," the
central bank said.  
  
The Governing Council decided to increase the size of the pandemic
emergency purchase programme, or PEPP, by EUR 600 billion to a total EUR
1,350 billion, the bank said in a statement.  
  
This expansion will further ease the general monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance and
support funding conditions in the real [economy][2], especially for
businesses and households, the ECB said.  
  
The central bank said the asset purchases under the PEPP will continue
to be conducted in a flexible manner across asset classes and among
jurisdictions.  
  
"This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the
smooth transmission of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," the ECB said.  
  
The minutes of the April [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session had shown that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers saw
the PEPP, worth EUR 750 billion when announced in March, was essential
and limited the likelihood of a "self-reinforcing downward spiral".

The April minutes had signaled that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers were willing to boost
the size of the PEPP if they judged, based on data prior to the June
meeting, that economic stimulus was falling short.  
  
On Thursday, the ECB also extended the horizon for net purchases under
the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021. Further, the bank said the
Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until
it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.

Proceeds from the maturing securities bought under the PEPP will be
reinvested until at least the end of 2022, the ECB said, adding that the
future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid
interference with the appropriate monetary stance.

The central bank retained the size of the monthly purchases under its
asset purchase programme (APP) at EUR 20 billion, together with the
additional EUR 120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year.  
  
"The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases
under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the
accommodative impact of its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates, and to end shortly before it
starts raising the key ECB interest rates," the bank said, retaining its
forward guidance.  
  
Reinvestments of proceeds from maturing securities bought under the APP
will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past the date
when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates,
and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favorable liquidity
conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation, the central
bank said.  
  
The ECB left the main refinancing rate unchanged at 0.00 percent, the
deposit facility rate at -0.50 percent and the marginal lending facility
rate at 0.25 percent.  
  
"The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at
their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook
robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent
within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been
consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics," the bank said,
retaining its forward guidance.

ECB President Christine Lagarde is set to hold the post-decision press
conference at 8.30 am ET when she will explain the rationale behind the
latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision and present the latest set of ECB staff
macroeconomic projections.
