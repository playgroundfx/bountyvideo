The European Central Bank slashed its growth and inflation projections
for this year and expects the single-currency [economy][1] to contract
sharply as the coronavirus, or Covid-19, hurt economic activity
severely.  
  
ECB President Christine Lagarde presented the latest set of ECB staff
macroeconomic projections on Thursday during her post-decision press
conference.  
  
For this year, the ECB staff projected an 8.7 percent contraction versus
the 0.8 percent growth seen in the previous round in March.  
  
However, the growth projections for the next two years were raised. The
growth outlook for 2021 was increased to 5.2 percent from 1.3 percent,
and the forecast for 2022 was raised to 3.3 percent from 1.4 percent.  
  
The inflation projections for all three years were lowered amid weaker
energy price and an expected significant increase in economic slack. The
forecast for this year was cut to 0.3 percent from 1.1 percent.

The outlook for next year was lowered to 0.8 percent from 1.4 percent
and the projection for 2022 was eased to 1.3 percent from 1.6 percent.  
  
The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining
at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year, before
rebounding again in the second half, crucially helped by the sizeable
support from fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Lagarde said in her
introductory statement.  
  
"Overall, the Governing Council sees the balance of risks around the
baseline projection to the downside," Lagarde said.

In the first quarter, the euro area shrunk 3.8 percent from the previous
three months.

The ECB staff has projected a 13 percent slump in the second quarter.
The economy is expected to rebound somewhat in the third quarter as
lockdown restrictions are withdrawn.  
  
The baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty, she
said.  
  
Hence, the ECB staff presented two scenarios - a mild one and a severe
one.  
  
In the mild scenario, the economic shock from the Covid-19 is seen as
temporary, with a fast and successful containment of the virus allowing
restrictions to be removed swiftly. Further, no resurgence of the virus
is seen in this.  
  
Under this, real GDP would decline by 5.9 percent this year, followed by
a strong rebound in 2021. By the end of the horizon, real GDP would
almost reach the level of the March 2020 staff projections. Inflation is
seen reaching 1.7 percent by 2022.  
  
The severe scenario, with a strong resurgence of infections, implies
more stringent containment measures that significantly weigh on economic
activity.  
  
Under this, real GDP is seen crashing 12.6 percent in 2020 and, by the
end of the projection horizon, stands around 91/2 percent below its
level in the March 2020 staff projections, with the inflation rate at
only 0.9 percent in 2022.
