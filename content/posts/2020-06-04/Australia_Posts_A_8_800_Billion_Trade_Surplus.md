Australia had a seasonally adjusted merchandise trade surplus of A$8.800
billion in April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday -
down 16 percent on month.

That exceeded expectations for a surplus of A$7.5 billion following the
downwardly revised A$10.44 billion surplus in March (originally A$10.60
billion).

Exports were down 11.0 percent on month following the downwardly revised
13.9 percent increase in the previous month.

Imports sank 10.0 percent on month after losing a revised 3.6 percent a
month earlier (originally -4.0 percent).
