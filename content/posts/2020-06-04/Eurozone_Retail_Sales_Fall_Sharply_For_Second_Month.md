Eurozone retail sales declined sharply for the second straight month in
April as [coronavirus][1] containment measures weighed on consumer
spending, data from Eurostat showed Thursday.

Retail sales decreased 11.7 percent month-on-month, following an 11.1
percent drop in March. Economists had forecast a monthly decrease of 15
percent. This was the second consecutive fall in sales volume.

Sales of food, drinks and tobacco were down 5.5 percent. At the same
time, automotive fuel sales decreased 27.7 percent and non-food product
sales plunged 17 percent largely reflecting weak clothing and footwear
sales.

On a yearly basis, retail sales volume was down 19.6 percent after
declining 8.8 percent a month ago. Sales were expected to fall 22.3
percent in April.

In the EU27, retail sales volume decreased 11.1 percent from the
previous month and declined 18 percent on a yearly basis in April.
