Ireland's service sector continued to contract in May due to the ongoing
lockdown measures to control the spread of [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 23.4 in May from a
record-low of 13.9 in April. A score below 50 indicates contraction in
the sector. This was the second-lowest reading ever recorded.

New [business][2] received declined at a softer rate in May and new
works decreased as demand dry up due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The volume of outstanding business declined. Employment fell for the
third straight month in May with the rate of job shedding easing
slightly from April.

On the price front, deflationary pressures remained in May and input
prices fell for the second straight month. Firms cut their own charges
to bring in revenues, with the rate of reduction strongest since April
2013.

The 12-month outlook for activity remained weak in May and the overall
degree of pessimism was softer.

Private sector output, covering manufacturing and services, continued to
drop at [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly marked pace in May. The composite output index rose
to 25.7 in May from 17.3 in the previous month.
