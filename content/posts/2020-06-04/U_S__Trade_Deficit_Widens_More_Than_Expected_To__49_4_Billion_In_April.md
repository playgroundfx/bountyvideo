A report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the U.S.
trade deficit widened by slightly more than anticipated in the month of
April.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $49.4 billion
in April from a revised $42.3 billion in March.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to $49.0 billion from
the $44.4 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider than expected trade deficit came as a nosedive in the value of
exports outpaced a slump in the value of imports.

The value of exports plunged by 20.5 percent to $151.3 billion,
reflecting substantial decreases in exports of capital goods, industrial
supplies and materials and automotive vehicles, parts and engines.

Meanwhile, the report said the value of imports tumbled by 13.7 percent
to $200.7 billion amid steep drops in imports automotive vehicles, parts
and engines, capital goods and consumer goods.

"The closure of motor vehicle production plants throughout North America
played the biggest role in the slump in trade," said Paul Ashworth,
Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics. "Services trade was hit by
further declines in travel and transport."

"Services trade isn't going to rebound any time soon with the borders
partly closed, but the reopening of motor vehicle production plants in
mid-May means we should see a rebound over the coming months," he added.

The Commerce Department noted the goods deficit widened to $71.8 billion
in April from $66.0 billion in March, while the services surplus fell to
$22.4 billion from $23.7 billion.
