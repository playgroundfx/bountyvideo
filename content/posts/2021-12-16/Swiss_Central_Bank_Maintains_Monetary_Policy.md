The Swiss National Bank maintained its expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), as
widely expected, on Thursday.

Policymakers of the central bank decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and
interest on sight deposits at the SNB at -0.75 percent.

The bank reiterated that it is willing to intervene in the foreign
exchange market as necessary, in order to counter upward pressure on the
Swiss franc. The Swiss franc remains highly valued.

The bank said supply bottlenecks are likely to persist for some time
yet, leading to price increases for the goods concerned. This situation
is likely to ease over the medium term, however, with inflation abroad
dropping back to more moderate levels.

The bank forecast consumer prices to rise 0.6 percent this year, up from
the previous forecast of 0.5 percent.

Inflation is expected to rise to 1.0 percent next year instead of 0.7
percent projected in September. The outlook for 2023 was left unchanged
at 0.6 percent.

GDP is forecast to grow by around 3.5 percent this year, slightly bigger
than the 3 percent estimated previously.

The SNB anticipated a continuation of the economic recovery next year,
with the [economy][1] expanding around 3 percent in 2022.

Further, the SNB cautioned that the vulnerability of the mortgage and
real estate [markets][2] has increased further.
