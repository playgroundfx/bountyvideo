The euro area trade surplus declined sharply in October as the pace of
increase in imports exceeded exports growth, data from Eurostat showed
on Thursday.

The trade surplus decreased to a seasonally adjusted EUR 2.4 billion in
October from EUR 6.1 billion in September.

Exports grew only 2.4 percent, while imports posted a monthly increase
of 4.3 percent in October.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus totaled EUR 3.6 billion in
October compared to a EUR 29.8 billion surplus in the same period last
year. Exports gained 7.3 percent annually. At the same time, imports
registered a double-digit growth of 24.1 percent.

Another report from Eurostat showed that hourly labor cost rebounded 2.5
percent on a yearly basis in the third quarter, following a 0.1 percent
drop in the second quarter.

The two main components of labor costs namely wages & salaries increased
2.3 percent and non-wage costs component rose 3.0 percent.
