The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it will discontinue
purchasing assets under its Covid-19 pandemic stimulus scheme at the end
of March and continue slowing asset purchases during the rest of next
year, as support for maintaining an expansionary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is fast
drying up in the face of stubbornly high inflation in the euro area.  
  
Pressure mounted on the ECB to not fall behind the curve with the
Federal Reserve accelerating its tapering plans this week and the Bank
of England hiking its key interest rate, earlier on Thursday, for the
first time since 2018.  
  
The EUR 1,850 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP,
was launched in March 2020 to support the euro area [economy][1] and
financial system amid the risks posed by the disruptions caused by the
coronavirus pandemic.  
  
The Governing Council, led by ECB President Christine Lagarde, decided
to extend the reinvestment horizon for the PEPP to until at least the
end of 2024, the bank said. Earlier, the reinvestments were set to end
at the end of 2023.  
  
Policymakers also decided a monthly net purchase pace of EUR 40 billion
in the second quarter and EUR 30 billion in the third quarter under the
asset purchase programme, or APP. Monthly asset purchases under the
scheme are currently conducted at EUR 20 billion.  
  
Further, the ECB said net purchases under the PEPP could also be
resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the
pandemic.

Flexibility will remain an element of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) whenever threats
to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) transmission jeopardise the attainment of price
stability, the ECB said.

In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic,
PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes
and jurisdictions at any time, the bank added.

From October 2022 onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset
purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion for as long
as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates,
the bank said.  
  
The ECB reaffirmed that it expects net purchases to end shortly before
it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.

The bank left its key interest rates unchanged as expected. The main
refinancing rate thus remains at zero, the deposit rate at -0.50 percent
and the marginal lending rate at 0.25 percent.  
  
"The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at
their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching 2 percent
well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest
of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in
underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with
inflation stabilising at 2 percent over the medium term," the bank said.

The bank reiterated that it expects the special conditions applicable
under its targeted lending operation, TLTRO III, to end in June next
year.  
The ECB has entered into a very cautious tapering process, ING economist
Carsten Brzeski said.

"This is less clear-cut than we had expected - the ECB chose to ensure
the same level of PEPP flexibility in the asset purchases, including
allowing it to purchase Greek bonds, and with a transition programme and
not the reinvestmentÂ of PEPP purchases," Brzeski said.

"Rate hikes are still far off."

Capital Economics expects inflation to be even higher than the ECB
forecasts next year.  
  
"We agree that, on balance, inflation is likely to come back below 2
percent over the medium term but the risks of it remaining higher for
longer, and of the ECB raising interest rates slightly in 2023, have
increased," Capital Economics economist Andrew Kenningham said.
