The Bank of Japan will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Friday and
then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a light day
for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The BoJ is expected to keep its
benchmark lending rate unchanged at -0.10 percent, although there may be
adjustments to other forms of stimulus.

Singapore will release November numbers for non-oil domestic exports,
with forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.2 percent on month and 17.3
percent on year. That follows the 4.2 percent monthly increase and the
17.9 percent yearly gain in October.

China will see November figures for foreign direct investment; in
October, FDI was up 17.8 percent on year.
