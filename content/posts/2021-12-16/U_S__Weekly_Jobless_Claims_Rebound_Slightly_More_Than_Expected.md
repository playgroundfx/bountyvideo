A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a modest
rebound in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended December 11th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose to 206,000, an
increase of 18,000 from the previous week's revised level of 188,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to inch up to 195,000 from the
184,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The slightly bigger than expected increase came after jobless claims
fell to their lowest level since 1969 in the previous week.

"While seasonal factors have made the data volatile in recent weeks, the
trend in jobless claims points to [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low layoff activity and
is consistent with a tight labor market," said Lydia Boussour, Lead
Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "Looking past the weekly noise, we expect initial claims will
steady around 200k in coming months given tight labor market conditions
and continued robust demand for workers, assuming the Omicron variant
has only a moderate negative impact on the [economy][1]."

The report showed the less volatile four-week moving average dipped to
203,750, a decrease of 16,000 from the previous week's revised average
of 219,750.

With the drop, the four-week moving average fell to its lowest level
since hitting 202,750 in the week ended November 15, 1969.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 154,000 to 1.845 million in the
week ended December 4, hitting the lowest level since March 14, 2020.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also slid to a
pandemic-era low of 1,963,250, a decrease of 66,000 from the previous
week's revised average of 2,029,250.
