Norway's central bank raised its key interest rate on Thursday, as
expected, and signaled that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers will most likely hike it again
in March.  
  
The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee unanimously
decided to raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent,
Norges Bank said in a statement.  
  
The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point hike in September.  
  
"There is considerable uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic
and its effects on the [economy][1]," Norges Bank Governor Oystein Olsen
said.  
  
"But if economic developments evolve broadly in line with the
projections, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised in March."

The bank said the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate forecast is little changed from the
September 2021 Monetary Policy Report and indicates a gradual rise in
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate in the coming years.

Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remains expansionary and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed that the
objective of stabilising inflation around the target somewhat further
out suggests that the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate should be raised towards a more normal
level.  
  
Further , a gradual normalization of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate is consistent with
continued high employment and higher interest rates will also help to
counter a build-up of financial imbalances.

Meanwhile, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers expressed concern regarding the potential
economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures in the period
ahead.  
  
"If there is a need for more stringent and protracted containment
measures that pull down economic activity through spring next year,
further rate hikes may be postponed," the bank said.

The risk of a persistently high inflation, in the backdrop of
potentially higher-than-projected increase in wages and prices due to
capacity constraints and persistent global price pressures, could prompt
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers to raise rates more quickly, the bank added.  
  
With oil prices well supported and gas prices continuing to rise,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers clearly felt that further tightening made sense this month,
despite Omicron, ING economist James Smith said.  
  
Though cases have surged and restrictions have returned, Norway benefits
from a reasonable start to its booster vaccine campaign, and like much
of the developed world, we don't expect Omicron to make a lasting dent
to Norway's economic recovery, the economist added.
