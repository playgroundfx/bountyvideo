Turkey's central bank slashed its key interest rates sharply for the
fourth straight month despite the continuing fall in the currency lira.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, governed by Sahap Kavcioglu, decided to cut the one-week repo
rate by 100 basis points to 14.00 percent from 15.00 percent.

Under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, the bank had lowered the
rate by 500 basis points since September.

"The Committee decided to complete the use of the limited room implied
by transitory effects of supply-side factors and other factors beyond
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)'s control on price increases and reduced the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate
by 100 basis points," the bank said in a statement.

The bank said cumulative impact of the recent [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions will be
monitored in the first quarter of 2022 and during this period, all
aspects of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework will be reassessed in order to create a
foundation for a sustainable price stability.

Policymakers said the increase in inflation in November has been driven
by developments in exchange rates and supply side factors. Further, the
committee viewed that domestic economic activity remains strong, with
the help of robust external demand

Turkey's central bank shrugged off a currency crisis, rising inflation
as well as the recent hawkish turn from the Fed and remained obedient to
President Erdogan, Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
