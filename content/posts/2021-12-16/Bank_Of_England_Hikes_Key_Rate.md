The Bank of England raised its key interest rate on Thursday as
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers viewed that some moderate tightening is required to bring
inflation down.  
  
The Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to lift its key rate by 0.15
percentage points to 0.25 percent from a record low of 0.10 percent.

The committee unanimously decided to maintain the bond purchase
programme at GBP 895 billion.

The MPC will review developments, including emerging evidence on the
implications for the [economy][1] of the Omicron variant, as part of its
forthcoming forecast round ahead of the February 2022 Monetary Policy
Report.

The committee said some modest tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) over the
forecast period is likely to be necessary to meet the 2 percent
inflation target sustainably.

Bank staff expects inflation to remain around 5 percent through the
majority of the winter period, and to peak at around 6 percent in April
2022. Inflation is still expected to fall back in the second half of
next year.
