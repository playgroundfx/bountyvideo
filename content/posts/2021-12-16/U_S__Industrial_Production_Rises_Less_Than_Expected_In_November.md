The Federal Reserve released a report on Thursday showing U.S.
industrial production increased by less than expected in the month of
November.

The Fed said industrial production rose by 0.5 percent in November after
surging by an upwardly revised 1.7 percent in October.

Economists had expected industrial production to climb by 0.7 percent
compared to the 1.6 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

While both manufacturing and mining output increased by 0.7 percent, the
growth was partly offset by a 0.8 percent drop in utilities output.

"The solid 0.7% increase in manufacturing output last month suggests
that shortages are gradually easing," said Michael Pearce, Senior US
Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "With demand still strong, the latest surveys point to
manufacturing output continuing to expand at close to 5% annualized pace
in the coming months."

Meanwhile, Pearce noted the decrease in utilities output reflected a dip
in heating demand amid the unseasonably warm conditions across much of
the country in November.

"That drop in utilities demand will eventually be revised while, even
accounting for the recent drop back in oil prices, there is still plenty
of scope for mining output to increase," he said.

The report also showed capacity utilization in the industrial sector
rose to 76.8 percent in November from a revised 76.5 percent in October.
The increase matched economist estimates.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and mining sectors climbed to
77.3 percent and 77.7 percent, respectively, while capacity utilization
in the utilities sector dipped to 73.2 percent.

Pearce noted capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector was at its
highest level since December 2018 and in line with its average since
1980.

"That in turn will maintain upward pressure on goods prices and suggests
that [business][1] equipment investment should strengthen in the
quarters ahead - assuming firms can source equipment against a backdrop
of still severe shortages," Pearce said
