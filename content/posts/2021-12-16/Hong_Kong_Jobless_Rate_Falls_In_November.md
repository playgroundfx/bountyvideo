Hong Kong's unemployment rate decreased during September to November
period, the labor force statistics from the Census and Statistics
Department showed on Thursday.

The unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.1 percent in three
months to November from 4.3 percent in three months to October.

The underemployment rate decreased to 1.8 percent from 1.9 percent in
the preceding period.

The number of unemployed persons decreased by around 13,800 to 158,000
in September-November. Over the same period, the number of underemployed
persons also declined by around 2,700 to 70,000.

Total employment increased about 6,800 to 3.673 million in three months
to November.

"With the local epidemic situation remaining under control, the local
economic and labour market conditions should continue to improve," the
Secretary for Labor and Welfare, Dr Law Chi-kwong, said.
