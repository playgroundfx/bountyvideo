The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it will discontinue
purchasing assets under its Covid-19 pandemic stimulus scheme at the end
of March next year.

The EUR 1,850 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP,
was launched in March 2020 to support the euro area [economy][1] and
financial system amid the risks posed by the disruptions caused by the
coronavirus pandemic.  
  
The Governing Council decided to extend the reinvestment horizon for the
PEPP to until at least the end of 2024, the bank said. Earlier, the
reinvestments were set to end at the end of 2023.  
  
Policymakers also decided a monthly net purchase pace of EUR 40 billion
in the second quarter and EUR 30 billion in the third quarter under the
asset purchase programme, or APP. Monthly asset purchases under the
scheme are currently conducted at EUR 20 billion.  
  
Further, the ECB said net purchases under the PEPP could also be
resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the
pandemic.

From October 2022 onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset
purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion for as long
as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates,
the bank said.  
  
The ECB reaffirmed that it expects net purchases to end shortly before
it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.

The bank left its key interest rates unchanged as expected. The main
refinancing rate thus remains at zero, the deposit rate at -0.50 percent
and the marginal lending rate at 0.25 percent.  
  
"The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at
their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching 2 percent
well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest
of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in
underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with
inflation stabilising at 2 percent over the medium term," the bank said.

The bank reiterated that it expects the special conditions applicable
under its targeted lending operation, TLTRO III, to end in June next
year.  
  
The ECB has entered into a very cautious tapering process, ING economist
Carsten Brzeski said.
