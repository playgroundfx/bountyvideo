Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity grew at a substantially slower
rate in the month of December, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
revealed in a report on Friday.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity tumbled to
15.4 in December after jumping to 39.0 in November, although a positive
reading still indicates growth. Economists had expected the index to
slump to 30.0.

With the much bigger than expected decrease, the Philly Fed Index fell
to its lowest level since hitting 11.1 in December 2020.

The sharp pullback by the Philly Fed index reflected significant
slowdowns in the pace of growth in both new orders and shipments.

The new orders index plummeted to 13.7 in December from 47.4 in
November, while the shipments index plunged to 15.3 from 32.1.

Meanwhile, the number of employees index climbed to 33.9 in December
from 27.2 in November, indicating an acceleration in the pace of job
growth.

The report also showed the prices paid index slid to 66.1 in December
from 80.0 in November, while the prices received index fell to 50.4 from
62.9.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said its future general activity and new
orders indexes moderated but noted surveyed firms remained generally
optimistic about growth over the next six months.

The diffusion index for future general activity slumped to 19.0 in
December from 28.5 in November, hitting its lowest reading since
February 2016.

"Manufacturers in the Philly Fed region look poised to maintain positive
attitudes in 2022 as solid demand and a heavy backlog of orders keep
them working in a high gear," said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics. "However stubborn supply-chain blockages will limit
their ability to keep up with demand."

On Wednesday, the New York Fed released a separate report unexpectedly
showing a modest acceleration in the pace of growth in regional
manufacturing activity in the month of December.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index inched
up to 31.9 in December from 30.9 in November. The uptick surprised
economists, who had expected the index to pull back to 20.5.
