New car registrations in Europe decreased in October after rising in the
previous month, as several countries in the region returned to lockdown
amid a second wave of the [coronavirus][1] or Covid-19.

EU passenger car registrations decreased 7.8 percent year-on-year to
953,615 units, following a 3.1 percent increase in September, the
Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA,
said Wednesday.

The growth in September was the first this year. Registrations plunged
over 76 percent in April at the peak of the pandemic.

Demand plummeted 21 percent in Spain, and fell 9.5 percent in France,
3.6 percent in Germany and 0.2 percent in Italy. Only Ireland and
Romania logged gains in October.

In the January to October period, registrations shrunk 26.8 percent, or
by 2.9 million units, from the same period last year.
