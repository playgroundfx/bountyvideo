Although the damage caused by the pandemic to the EU appears
considerably less than feared, the economic growth is likely to moderate
next year as the propelling forces of the re-opening are set to fade out
amid loosening supply bottlenecks.

According to the latest Autumn economic forecast, the euro area GDP is
projected to expand 5 percent this year, up from the prior outlook of
4.8 percent.

Meanwhile, the outlook for next year was lowered to 4.3 percent from 4.5
percent. In 2023, the currency bloc is forecast to expand 2.4 percent.  
  
The EU is also forecast to grow 5 percent in 2021 and 4.3 percent in
2022. Growth is projected to ease to 2.5 percent in 2023.

The EU said inflation in the euro area is set to peak at 3.7 percent in
the last quarter of the year and continue recording high prints in the
first half of 2022.

After reaching 2.4 percent in 2021, inflation is forecast to decline to
2.2 percent in 2022 and 1.4 percent in 2023, as energy prices are set to
gradually level out as from the second half of next year and the
imbalances between supply and demand solve.

The inflation forecast for this year and next year was upgraded notably
from 1.9 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.

As the [economy][1] expands, the labor market is forecast to complete
its recovery next year. The jobless rate is expected to decline to 7.5
percent in 2022 and then to 7.3 percent in 2023.

The EU said Germany's economy is set to recover despite supply
bottlenecks slowing down manufacturing and putting a lid on the rebound
of exports and investment.

The real GDP is projected to rebound 2.7 percent in 2021 and 4.6 percent
next year. In 2023, growth is set to ease to 1.7 percent, assuming a
normalization of supply and demand dynamics.

Despite high input prices and disruptions in the global supply chains
assumed to last until mid-2022, France growth is expected to remain
solid next year and in 2023. The economy is projected to grow 6.5
percent this year, 3.8 percent in 2022 and 2.3 percent in 2023.

Spain's GDP is set to speed up in the second half of the year and
achieve an annual growth rate of 4.6 percent in 2021, the EU said.
Overall real GDP is projected to grow 5.5 percent in 2022 and 4.4
percent in 2023.

Italy's GDP is projected to rebound 6.2 percent this year, before growth
moderates to 4.3 percent in 2022 and the economy returns to pre-crisis
output levels by mid next year. In 2023, economic activity is set to
expand 2.3 percent.

In the UK, the effects of supply shortages, higher unemployment and the
increase in inflation are expected to ease over the forecast horizon.
GDP is forecast to grow 6.9 percent in 2021. The growth is then expected
to slow to 4.8 percent in 2022 and 1.7 percent in 2023.
