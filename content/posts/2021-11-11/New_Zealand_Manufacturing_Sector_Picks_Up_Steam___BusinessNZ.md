The manufacturing sector in New Zealand accelerated in October, the
latest survey from BusinessNZ showed on Friday with a Performance of
Manufacturing Index score of 54.3.

That's up from 51.4 in September and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production (54.0), employment (52.1), new orders (53.9),
finished stocks (54.9) and deliveries (59.9) all were in expansion
territory.

"Even though October's reading is above average, we'd classify it more
in the realm of some recovery from a large hit rather than an indication
of outright strength," BNZ Senior Economist Doug Steel said.
