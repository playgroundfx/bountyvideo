The UK [economy][1] expanded at a slower pace in the third quarter on
negative contribution from net trade and the recent supply chain
challenges, the Office for National Statistics said Thursday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent sequentially in the third
quarter, but weaker than the 5.5 percent expansion seen in the previous
quarter and the economists' forecast of 1.5 percent. Nonetheless, this
was the second consecutive quarterly growth.

The largest contributors to the increase were from hospitality, arts and
recreation and [health][2] following the further easing of restrictions
and reopening of the economy.  
  
The level of GDP was 2.1 percent below where it was before the
[coronavirus][3] pandemic at the end of 2019.

On a monthly basis, GDP growth improved to 0.6 percent from revised 0.2
percent in August. The rate also exceeded the economists' forecast of
0.4 percent.

Industrial output grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter driven by the
26.3 percent increase in mining and quarrying. The expansion in mining
reflects the reopening of sites that had previously been temporarily
closed for planned maintenance.

At the same time, there was a 0.3 percent decline in manufacturing
output. The manufacture of motor vehicles decreased 8.2 percent in
September, the largest fall since last May.

Construction output fell 1.5 percent in the third quarter, after four
consecutive quarterly increases. Services output grew 1.6 percent, after
expanding 6.5 percent in the second quarter.

On the expenditure-side, household consumption grew 2 percent following
the continued easing of coronavirus restrictions. Underpinned by
increases in health, government spending was up 0.9 percent.

Gross fixed capital formation grew 0.8 percent and government investment
was up 4.3 percent. There was a moderate 0.4 percent increase in
[business][4] investment.

The underlying change in inventories was a fall of GBP 2.2 billion in
the third quarter. Data showed that the UK's trade balance fell to a
deficit of -1.2 percent of GDP in the third quarter.

Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said the shortages and
the hit to the real spending power of businesses and households from
higher taxes and rising utility prices will mean that GDP growth is
sluggish over the next six to nine months.  
  
This probably will not prevent interest rates from rising, with the
first hike from +0.10 percent to 0.25 percent perhaps coming in
December, the economist noted.  
However, it will contribute to rates going no higher than 0.50 percent
next year.

In a separate communiqu√©, the ONS said the visible trade deficit widened
to GBP 14.7 billion in September from GBP 13.7 billion in August.
Exports were up 1.9 percent, while imports rebounded 3.8 percent.

The overall trade balance showed a deficit of GBP 2.77 billion versus a
GBP 1.88 billion shortfall in August.
