Hong Kong will on Friday release final Q3 figures for gross domestic
product, highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

GDP is expected to rise 0.1 percent on quarter and 5.4 percent on year
after slipping 0.9 percent on quarter and climbing 7.6 percent on year
in the previous three months.

Australia will see November's inflation forecast; in October, consumer
prices were called 3.6 percent higher on year.
