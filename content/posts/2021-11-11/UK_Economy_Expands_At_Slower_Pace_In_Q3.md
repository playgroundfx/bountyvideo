The UK [economy][1] expanded at a slower pace in the third quarter, the
Office for National Statistics said Thursday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent sequentially in the third
quarter, but weaker than the 5.5 percent expansion seen in the previous
quarter. Nonetheless, this was the second consecutive growth.

The largest contributors to the increase were from hospitality, arts and
recreation.  
The level of GDP was 2.1 percent below where it was before the
[coronavirus][2] pandemic at the end of 2019.

On a monthly basis, GDP growth improved to 0.6 percent from revised 0.2
percent in August. The rate also exceeded the economists' forecast of
0.4 percent.

Industrial output grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter driven by the
26.3 percent increase in mining and quarrying.

At the same time, there was a 0.3 percent decline in manufacturing
output. The manufacture of motor vehicles decreased 8.2 percent in
September, the largest fall since last May.

Construction output fell 1.5 percent in the third quarter, after four
consecutive quarterly increases. Services output grew 1.6 percent, after
expanding 6.5 percent in the second quarter.
