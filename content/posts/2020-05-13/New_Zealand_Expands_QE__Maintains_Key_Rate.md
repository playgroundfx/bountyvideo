New Zealand's central bank decided to expand its asset purchase
programme to reduce the cost of borrowing as [coronavirus][1], or
Covid-19, pandemic is set to lower growth, employment and inflation.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, on
Wednesday, raised the large scale asset purchase programme potential to
NZ$60 billion from NZ$33 billion.

Policymakers maintained the Official Cash Rate, or OCR, at 0.25 percent,
as widely expected.

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will continue to provide significant support through
keeping interest rates low for the foreseeable future, the bank said.

The committee observed that a negative interest rate will become an
option in future, but currently, expansion to asset purchase programme
is the most effective way to deliver further stimulus.

The bank said it is prepared to use additional monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools if
and when needed, including reducing the OCR further, adding other types
of assets to the LSAP programme, and providing fixed term loans to
banks.

Policymakers noted that a 'least regrets' monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) approach is
needed, delivering stimulus sooner rather than later, and thus
minimizing the risk that the stimulus delivered turns out not to be
enough.

The asset purchase programme covers government bonds, local government
funding agency bonds and, now, NZ government inflation-indexed bonds.

Policymakers discussed several different scenarios for the economic
outlook. All scenarios involved a significant and unprecedented decline
in economic activity and employment.
