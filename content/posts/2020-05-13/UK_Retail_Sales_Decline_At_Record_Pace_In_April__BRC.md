UK retail sales declined the most since records began in 1995 due to
[coronavirus][1] lockdown, data published the British Retail Consortium,
or BRC, showed Wednesday.

Total retail sales plunged 19.1 percent year-on-year in April compared
to a 2.4 percent rise in April 2019. This was the worst decline recorded
since the BRC started monitoring in January 1995.

Meanwhile, like-for-like sales grew 5.7 percent on a yearly basis in
April versus a 2 percent increase in the same period last year. In
April, like-for-like sales have been measured excluding temporarily
closed stores but including online sales.

Over the three months to April, food sales grew 6.0 percent on a like-
for-like basis and 4.5 percent on a total basis.

At the same time, non-food retail sales decreased 4.4 percent on a like-
for-like and 17.5 percent on a total basis.

Food sales were disappointing, with the virus preventing large family
gatherings and turning Easter into a more modest affair, Helen
Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

For many non-food goods, such as clothing, footwear and large household
items, the decline was particularly steep as consumers responded to
lockdown conditions, Dickinson noted.
