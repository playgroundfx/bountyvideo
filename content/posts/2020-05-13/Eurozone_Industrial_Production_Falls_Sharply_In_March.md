Eurozone industrial production decreased sharply in March, as several
countries went into lockdown to slow the spread of the [coronavirus][1],
or Covid-19, pandemic, preliminary data from Eurostat showed on
Wednesday.

Industrial production decreased 11.3 percent month-on-month, which was
slightly less than the 12.1 percent slump economists had forecast. In
February, output fell 0.1 percent.

Among different industrial groups, durable consumer goods logged the
biggest decrease of 26.3 percent. Capital goods and intermediate goods
also logged double-digit declines.

On a year-on-year basis, industrial production decreased 12.9 percent in
March after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February.  
  
In the EU, industrial production fell 10.4 percent monthly, after
remaining unchanged in February. Compared to the same month last year,
production shrunk 11.8 percent.
