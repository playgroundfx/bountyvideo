Citing the unprecedented speed and scope of the [coronavirus][1]-induced
economic downturn, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday
the central bank may take additional steps to avoid an extended period
of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes.

"At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest until
the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,"
Powell said during a webcast hosted by the Peterson Institute for
International Economics.

However, Powell signaled the Fed remains reluctant to impose negative
interest rates, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on
the central bank to enact.

"I know there are fans of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), but for now it's not something
that we're considering," Powell said. "We think we have a good toolkit
and that's the one that we will be using."

The Fed Chief noted the economic outlook is "both highly uncertain and
subject to significant downside risks" and suggested it may be necessary
for Congress to provide additional stimulus.

"Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps
avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery,"
Powell said. "This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who
wield powers of taxation and spending."

Powell's comments come a day after House Democrats unveiled a new $3
trillion coronavirus relief bill that is likely to face considerable
opposition in the Republican-led Senate.

While the Fed and Congress have already provided considerable stimulus
that Powell described as "both timely and appropriately large," he noted
the initial response "may not be the final chapter."

Powell argued the coronavirus pandemic raises a new set of questions,
including how quickly it can be brought under control, whether new
outbreaks can be avoided as the [economy][2] reopens and how long it
will take to develop new therapies or a vaccine.

"The answers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the
timing and pace of the economic recovery," Powell said. "Since the
answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be ready to
address a range of possible outcomes."
