Australia's wages grew at a steady pace in the March quarter, figures
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday.

The wages price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in the
first quarter, the same rate of increase as seen in the fourth quarter.
The rate matched economists' expectations.

On a yearly basis, wages increased 2.1 percent in the first quarter,
after a 2.2 percent rise in the previous quarter. The annual rate also
came in line with economists' expectations.

Wages in the public sector grew 2.1 percent over the year and those in
private sector rose by 2.4 percent.

"Quarterly wage growth remained steady at 0.5% over the past four
quarters and on the back of a year of relatively stable but slow
economic growth," ABS Chief Economist, Bruce Hockman said.

"Today's data relates to the period shortly before restrictions were put in place to contain the spread of the [coronavirus][1] (COVID-19), capturing wage information for the mid-month (February) of the March quarter," Hockman said.
