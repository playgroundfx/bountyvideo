A measure of the public assessment of the Japanese [economy][1] declined
sharply in April, as economic activity remained hurt by the coronavirus,
or Covid-19, pandemic, survey data from the Cabinet Office showed on
Wednesday.

The current conditions index of the Economy Watchers' Survey, which
measures the current situation of the economy, decreased to 7.9 in April
from 14.2 in March.

The outlook index that signals future activity fell to 16.6 in April
from 18.8 in the previous month.

The economy watchers' point of view is that the situation is getting
worse and expected to deteriorate further, due to the extremely severe
challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the survey said.

Earlier in the day, data showed that the current account surplus was JPY
1971 billion in March versus JPY 3,168.8 billion in the previous month.
Economists had forecast a surplus of JPY 2,211 billion.
