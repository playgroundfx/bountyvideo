Australia's consumer confidence recovered in May from a very low level,

Although the turnaround in the score was the biggest monthly gain since
the survey began nearly fifty years ago, the latest reading was the
second lowest since the global financial crisis.

Among components of the index, consumers' financial situation compared
to a year ago increased to 74.3 in May from 70.4 in the previous month.

rose to 102.0 from 90.9 in the preceding month.

Likewise, assessment of economic condition for the next 12 months

month.

The sub-index 'time to buy a major household item' surged to 96.6 from
76.2 in April. The '[economy][1] next five years' index came in at 96.3
in May versus 87.0 in April.
