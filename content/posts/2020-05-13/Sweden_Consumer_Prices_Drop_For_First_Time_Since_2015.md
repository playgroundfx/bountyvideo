Sweden's consumer price dropped for the first time in nearly five years
in April, data from Statistics Sweden showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in April, after a
0.6 percent increase in March. Economists had expected a 0.1 percent
rise. This was the first decrease since August 2015.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices fell 0.3 percent in April,
following a 0.2 percent decline in the preceding month. The rate came in
line with expectations.

The CPI with fixed interest rate, or CPIF, fell 0.4 percent annually in
April, after a 0.6 percent increase in the prior month. Economists had
expected a 0.7 percent rise.

On a monthly basis, the CPIF decreased 0.3 percent in April, after a 0.2
percent fall in the previous month. This was in line with economists'
expectations.
