The UK [economy][1] contracted the most since the global financial
crisis as measures adopted to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus
took a toll on overall activity, data from Office for National
Statistics revealed on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product fell 2 percent sequentially in the first quarter,
which was the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2008.

Economists had forecast a bigger fall of 2.5 percent, after stagnation
in the fourth quarter of 2019.

"With the arrival of the pandemic nearly every aspect of the economy was
hit in March, dragging growth to a record monthly fall," Jonathan Athow,
deputy national statistician for economic statistics at ONS, said.

On a yearly basis, GDP decreased 1.6 percent, marking the biggest
contraction since late 2009. This was also slower than the expected
decline of 2.1 percent.

Data showed that there was a widespread disruption to economic activity
in the first quarter. Services output fell by a record 1.9 percent.

At the same time, industrial output fell 2.1 percent driven by a 1.7
percent drop in manufacturing. Production of transport equipment fell
20.5 percent with sharp reduction in motor vehicles and trailers
industry.

Construction output decreased 2.6 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, which was the largest fall since 2012.

The Bank of England last week cautioned that GDP could fall by 14
percent in this year before picking up in 2021.

There is little doubt that the worst is still to come, ING Economist
James Smith, said.

The second quarter is likely to see a decline in GDP in excess of 10
percent, and with the vast majority of lockdown measures likely to
persist into June, the risk is that the damage is greater, Smith noted.

The economist said it is now very hard to imagine a rapid 'V-shape'
recovery, and a return to pre-virus levels of activity is not expected
until 2022 at the earliest.

The expenditure-side breakdown of GDP showed that household consumption
was down 1.7 percent in the first quarter, the largest drop since 2008.
Reflecting declines in [health][2] and education spending, government
expenditure dropped 2.6 percent in the first quarter.

Gross fixed capital formation fell 1 percent, marking the second
consecutive quarter of decline. Business investment was flat.

In March, GDP declined 5.8 percent after contracting 0.2 percent in
February. This was the biggest monthly fall since the series began in
1997.

Services and construction saw record declines in March. The index of
services dropped 6.2 percent and construction fell 5.9 percent.

The index of production slid 4.2 percent and farm output dropped 0.2
percent in March.

Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade deficit
widened to GBP 28.12 billion in the three months to March from GBP 15.5
billion shortfall seen a quarter ago. The total trade balance swung to a
deficit of GBP 4.7 billion.

In March, the visible trade deficit widened to GBP 12.5 billion from GBP
9.8 billion in February. Likewise, the total trade deficit increased to
GBP 6.67 billion from GBP 1.54 billion.

Overall exports plunged 12.9 percent on month and imports decreased 3.5
percent in March.
