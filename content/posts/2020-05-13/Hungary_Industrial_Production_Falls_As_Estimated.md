Hungary's industrial production declined in March as estimated, due to
the impact of [coronavirus][1], or COVID-19 pandemic, data from the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Wednesday.

Industrial production dropped a working-day adjusted 10.0 percent year-
on-year in March, after a 1.5 percent increase in February. This was in
line with THE initial estimate.

The economic effects caused by the Covid-19 epidemic were already
significant in this period, the agency said.

On a non-adjusted basis, industrial production decreased 5.6 percent
annually in March, as estimated, after a 3.8 percent rise in the
preceding month.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production fell 10.4 percent
monthly in March, following a 0.1 percent decrease in the prior month,
as initially estimated.
