The Czech Republic's inflation eased in April, largely led by a fall in
transport cost, data from the Czech Statistical Office showed on
Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 3.2 percent year-on-year in April, after a
3.4 percent increase in March. Economists had expected a 3.1 percent
rise.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages grew 7.8 percent annually in
April. Prices of restaurants and hotels, and alcoholic beverages and
tobacco increased by 5.1 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively.

Meanwhile, prices in the post and telecommunication group declined by
4.9 percent and transport cost fell 3.8 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in April. This was
in line with economists' expectation.

Price drop of fuels continued for the third month, down 10.5 percent in
April, which was the highest month-on-month price decrease since the
series began in 1993.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the import prices
fell 0.3 percent annually in March, following a 3.2 percent decline in
February.

Export prices rose 1.1 percent yearly in March, after a 3.2 percent
decline in the previous month.
