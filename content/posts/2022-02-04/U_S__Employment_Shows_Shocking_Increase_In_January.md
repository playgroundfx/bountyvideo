Employment in the U.S. increased by much more than expected in the month
of January, according to a closely watched report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said employment jumped by 467,000 jobs in January
compared to economist estimates for an increase of 150,000 jobs.

The report also showed the increase in employment in December was
upwardly revised to 510,000 jobs compared to the previously reported
199,000 jobs.

"The 467,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in January is even stronger than
it looks, as it came despite the spike in absenteeism driven by the
Omicron virus wave and was accompanied by significant upward revisions
to the gains over the preceding couple of months," said Andrew Hunter,
Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "That will inevitably further fuel expectations of the Fed
unleashing a larger 50bp hike at the March meeting, although we still
think that a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter will
give officials second thoughts."

The Labor Department said the stronger than expected job growth
reflected increases in employment in the leisure and hospitality,
professional and [business][1] services, retail trade, and
transportation and warehousing sectors.

The increase in employment in the leisure and hospitality sector
reported by the Labor Department is in stark contrast to the steep drop
in employment reported by payroll processor ADP.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate inched up to
4.0 percent in January from 3.9 percent in December. Economists had
expected the unemployment rate to hold unchanged.

The uptick in the unemployment rate came as the labor force increased by
163,687 persons, while the household measure of employment rose by
157,174 persons.
