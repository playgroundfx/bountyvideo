The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its inflation outlook citing robust
demand for housing and the increases in prices of durable goods and
fuel.

In the latest Statement on Monetary Policy, released Friday, the central
bank said underlying inflation picked up in recent quarters and is
forecast to increase further to 3.25 percent in mid-2022, largely
reflecting upstream cost pressures amid strong demand in housing
construction and the durables goods sector.  
  
The outlook for mid-2022 was revised up from 2.25 percent estimated
previously.  
  
Inflation is forecast to remain in the top half of the 2 to 3 percent
target range with a steady pick-up in labor costs in response to strong
labor market conditions.  
  
The unemployment rate is forecast to decline gradually over the forecast
period, to 3.75 percent by the end of 2023.

GDP growth is forecast to strengthen through the middle of this year,
with broad-based growth in domestic demand sustained across the forecast
period. The mid-2022 growth outlook was upgraded to 5 percent from 4
percent.

However, the projection for mid-2023 was downgraded to 2.50 percent from
3.25 percent. Growth is seen at 2 percent in June 2024.
