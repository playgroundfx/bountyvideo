The UK construction sector expanded at the fastest pace in six months in
January, IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing
Managers' Index rose to 56.3 in January from 54.3 in December. A score
above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

The index registered above the crucial 50.0 no-change mark for the
twelfth month in a row. The latest reading signaled the strongest rate
of output expansion since July 2021.

Commercial work was by far the best-performing category with growth
accelerating to a six-month high. The index rose to 57.6.

At the same time, civil engineering returned to growth in January,
although the rebound was softer than seen in other parts of the
construction sector. Meanwhile, house building activity grew at the
slowest pace for four months.
