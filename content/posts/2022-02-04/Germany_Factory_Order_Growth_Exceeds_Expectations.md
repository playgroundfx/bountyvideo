Germany's factory orders growth exceeded expectations in December
underpinned by robust domestic demand, data from Destatis revealed on
Friday.

Factory orders grew 2.8 percent on a monthly basis, but slower than the
3.6 percent expansion seen in November. Economists had forecast the
growth rate to ease sharply to 0.5 percent. This was the second
consecutive rise in orders.  
  
Excluding major orders, factory orders were up 2.9 percent.

On a yearly basis, growth in new orders accelerated to 5.5 percent from
2.3 percent in the previous month.

Domestic orders were up 11.7 percent, while foreign orders dropped 3
percent from the previous month. Within foreign demand, incoming orders
from the euro zone fell 4.2 percent and that from the rest of the world
decreased 2.3 percent.

Producers of intermediate goods reported a 4.1 percent rise in orders
and the producers of capital goods recorded an increase of 1.8 percent.
Regarding consumer goods, orders went up 5.3 percent.

In the whole year of 2021, new orders were up 17.8 percent from a year
earlier and 9.3 percent higher than in the pre-crisis year 2019.

Further, data showed that real manufacturing turnover was up 0.2 percent
from November, when it grew by revised 4.3 percent.

Elsewhere, survey results from IHS Markit showed that the German
construction sector grew at the fastest pace in almost two years in
January.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.4 in January, up
sharply from 48.2 in December.

The result pointed to the strongest growth since February 2020, and
partly reflected less weather-related disruption than usual during the
month, underlying data suggested.
