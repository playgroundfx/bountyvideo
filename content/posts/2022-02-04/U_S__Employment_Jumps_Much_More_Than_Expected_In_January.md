Employment in the U.S. increased by much more than expected in the month
of January, according to a closely watched report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said employment jumped by 467,000 jobs in January
compared to economist estimates for an increase of 150,000 jobs.

The report also showed the increase in employment in December was
upwardly revised to 510,000 jobs compared to the previously reported
199,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate inched up to
4.0 percent in January from 3.9 percent in December. Economists had
expected the unemployment rate to hold unchanged.
