Australia's [economy][1] is set to log a more sustainable above trend
growth through the remainder of 2021 and 2022, according to Westpac
report, released Wednesday.

The six-month annualized growth rate in the Westpac-Melbourne Institute
Leading Index, slowed to 1.47 percent in May from 2.86 percent in April.

Over the second half of 2021, Westpac expects that annualised pace to
slow further to 4.5 percent, while the next year growth is forecast at a
more normal but still healthy 3.2 percent.

The second half growth forecast is still well above trend but more in
line with the six month annualized growth rate of 1.47 percent which the
leading index has printed for May.

The index growth rate has moderated to 1.47 percent in May from just
under 5 percent six months ago.

Two components account for most of the move, namely US industrial
production and total hours worked. Both saw extremely strong 'reopening
rebounds' as COVID restrictions were eased late last year.

Other components showed a more mixed performances over the six month
period. On the plus side, commodity prices continued to surge. Most
other components tended to follow the wider them of normalising growth.

Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac said, given the improved pulse of
the economic data in 2021, as signaled by the Leading Index, it seems
unlikely that the central bank would expect to have to wait until 2025
before it achieves the objectives necessary to justify the first cash
rate increase since November 2010.
