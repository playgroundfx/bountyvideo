New Zealand's gross domestic product climbed 2.4 percent on year in the
first three months of 2021, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.9 percent following the
upwardly revised 0.8 percent contraction in the previous three months
(originally -0.9 percent).

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP rose 1.6 percent - again
beating forecasts for a gain of 0.5 percent following the 1.0 percent
decline in the three months prior.
