Reflecting a jump in fuel prices, the Labor Department released a report
on Wednesday showing U.S. import prices increased by more than expected
in the month of May.

The Labor Department said import prices jumped by 1.1 percent in May
after climbing by an upwardly revised by 0.8 percent in April.

Economists had expected import prices to increase by 0.8 percent
compared to the 0.7 percent advance originally reported for the previous
month.

Prices for fuel imports led the way higher, spiking by 4.0 percent in
May after surging by 1.6 percent in April. The jump reflected notable
increases in prices for both petroleum and natural gas.

Excluding fuel, import prices advanced by 0.9 percent in May after
climbing by 0.7 percent in April. The increase reflected higher prices
for non-fuel industrial supplies and materials, consumer goods, and
automotive vehicles.

Compared to the same month a year ago, import prices in May were up by
11.3 percent, reflecting the biggest annual increase since September of
2011.

"As supply-side constraints gradually dissipate and the influence of
base effects gradually fades in the coming months, we expect the pace of
import price inflation to moderate in the second half of the year," said
Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

The report also showed export prices spiked by 2.2 percent in May after
surging by an upwardly revised 1.1 percent in April.

Economists had expected export prices to climb by 0.8 percent, matching
the increase originally reported for the previous month.

The much bigger than expected increase in export prices was partly due
to a 6.1 percent spike in prices for agricultural exports, which
reflected sharply higher prices for soybeans, corn and wheat.

Prices for non-agricultural exports also jumped 1.7 percent in May,
driven by higher prices for non-agricultural industrial supplies and
materials and consumer goods.

Export prices soared by 17.4 percent year-over-year in May, showing the
biggest increase since the data was first published in September of
1983.
