The German [economy][1] is set to grow at a slower than previously
estimated pace this year as the bottlenecks in the supply of
intermediate products weigh on manufacturing activity, the ifo Institute
said in its Summer forecast, released Wednesday.

Gross domestic product is expected to grow 3.3 percent in 2021, down
from the 3.7 percent growth estimated in March. However, the projection
for next year was lifted to 4.3 percent from 3.2 percent.

With falling infection rates and progress in vaccination against
Covid-19, the existing economic restrictions should gradually be lifted,

But the manufacturing boom is likely to cool somewhat in its further
course due to the bottlenecks in the supply chain.

The unemployment rate is expected to average 5.8 percent in 2021 and 5.2
percent in 2022.

While short-time work will fall back to its pre-crisis level in the
coming year, unemployment will remain above this level at an annual
average of 2.4 million people.

Consumer price inflation is seen at 2.6 percent in 2021, up from the
Spring forecast of 2.4 percent. The outlook for 2022 was raised to 1.9
percent from 1.7 percent.
