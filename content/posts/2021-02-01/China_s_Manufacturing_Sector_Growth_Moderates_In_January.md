China's manufacturing sector expanded at the slowest pace in seven
months in January amid a slowdown in output and new orders growth,
survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday.

The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 51.5 in
January from 53.0 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.

The slowdown in manufacturing is not surprising given that output was
already well above trend - capacity utilization rates in industry hit an
eight-year high last quarter, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue,
economists at Capital Economics, said. Despite the slowdown, activity
will remain strong in the near-term.

"This year, we should pay attention to the effectiveness of domestic
epidemic prevention amid the ongoing pandemic, and look at [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) bring
new momentum to the Chinese [economy][1] as uncertainties over overseas
demand continue," Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group
said.

Manufacturers signaled a sustained rise in output in January, to extend
the current period of expansion to 11 months. However, the rate of
growth was the least marked since last April.

The slowdown coincided with a weaker increase in total new work at the
start of the year as there was a renewed drop in export orders, which
fell for the first time in six months. Respondents cited the resurgence
of the Covid-19 virus globally as the reason for the reduction.

Employment decreased in January, albeit only marginal. Lower staff
numbers were generally attributed to company restructuring and the non-
replacement of voluntary leavers.

At the same time, manufacturers recorded the slowest accumulation in
backlogs of work for eight months. Goods producers recorded a softer
expansion of buying activity at the start of the year, with firms
generally commented that purchasing rose in line with sales.

Notably, the latest upturn was the weakest since the current period of
recovery began last May. At the same time, stocks of purchases fell
moderately after a slight increase at the end of 2020.

Stock shortages at suppliers and shipping delays led to a further
increase in delivery times for inputs, the survey showed.

Low stock availability and higher raw material prices lifted operating
expenses. Moreover, the rate of inflation eased only slightly from
December's three-year high. Manufacturers raised their selling prices at
the steepest rate since June 2018.  
  
Although manufacturers in China generally expect output to rise over the
next year, the degree of positive sentiment edged down to an eight-month
low in January.
