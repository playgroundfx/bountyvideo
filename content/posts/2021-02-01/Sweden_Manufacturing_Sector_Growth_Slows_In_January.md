Swedish manufacturing sector expanded at a softer pace in January,
survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on
Monday.

The purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for manufacturing fell to 62.4
in January from a revised 64.7 in December. This was the first time in
eight months that the reading declined.

Economists had expected a higher score of 65. A reading above 50
suggests growth in the sector.

"The beginning of 2021 shows continued high activity in the Swedish
manufacturing industry at the same time as the companies 'production
plans have become more expansive, which indicates an optimistic view of
the [economy][1] for the next six months," Jorgen Kennemar, a PMI
analyst at Swedbank, said.

Employment sub-index declined the most in January and suppliers delivery
time lengthened. Order intake and production fell.

Production plans continued to rise in January.

Prices for suppliers' raw material and intermediate goods prices
increased in January to the highest level since 2004.

"It is increasingly clear that the higher level of activity in industry
and rising global raw material prices have led to increased price
pressure at the producer level, making an impression on the consumer
level," Kennemar said.
