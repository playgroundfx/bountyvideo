The manufacturing sector in Vietnam continued to expand in January,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics
revealed on Monday with a seasonally adjusted PMI score of 51.3.

That's down from 51.7 in December although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, January saw a broadly stable picture for manufacturing
production. While the rise in new orders supported increases in output
at some firms, others reported that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
continued to lead to falls in production.

Manufacturers kept their workforce numbers broadly unchanged, following
a rise in December. Some firms raised employment in response to higher
new orders, while others noted a reduction amid the pandemic and staff
resignations. Purchasing activity was also little-changed.
