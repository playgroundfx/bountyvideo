Sweden's [economy][1] grew less than expected in the final three months
of 2019 and shrank for the whole year as the coronavirus pandemic
impacted activity severely, preliminary data from Statistics Sweden
showed on Monday.

Gross domestic product rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent from the
third quarter, when the economy grew a revised 4.3 percent. Economists
had forecast 0.7 percent growth.  
  
The economy expanded for a second consecutive quarter.

The latest upturn implies that in the second half of the year, the
economy recovered 63 percent of the large decline from the second
quarter, Statistics Sweden said.  
  
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, the economy shrunk 2.6 percent
in the fourth quarter after a 2.5 percent contraction in the previous
three months. Economists had expected a 2.3 percent fall.  
  
The Swedish economy contracted 2.8 percent in the year 2020.
