The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to expand in January,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed
on Monday with a seasonally adjusted PMI score of 52.2.

That's up from 51.3 in December and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new order growth accelerated, while output rose at a near-
record pace. Business confidence reached a four-year high.

Suppliers' delivery times lengthened to the greatest extent since May
2020, with restrictions due to COVID-19, issues with shipping and raw
material shortages all contributing to delays in January.
