The manufacturing sector in Myanmar continued to contract in January,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics
revealed on Monday with a seasonally adjusted PMI score of 47.8.

That's up from 44.7 in December although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production volumes dropped for the fifth month running in
January, although to the weakest extent since the second downturn began
in September. Anecdotal evidence mostly cited factory closures and
subdued demand conditions.

Supply chain pressures continued to mount at the start of the year with
average lead times lengthening for the fifth month running.
