India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said the
government will stick to the fiscal consolidation path despite raising
spending on healthcare to face the challenges posed by the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The government intends to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5 percent
of GDP by 2025-2026 with a fairly steady decline over the period, she
said in her 2021-22 budget speech in the parliament.

The fiscal deficit estimate for 2020-21 was revised to 9.5 percent of
GDP versus 3.5 percent estimated earlier. The minister attributed the
bigger deficit to higher expenditure to support the people and
[economy][2] and weak revenue inflows amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The deficit was funded through government borrowings, multilateral
borrowings, small saving funds and short term borrowings, she said.

The government will borrow an additional INR 800 billion to fund the
deficit in the current fiscal year.

The government aims to lower the fiscal deficit to 6.8 percent of GDP in
the fiscal year starting April and eventually to 4.5 percent by the
fiscal year 2026.

The gross borrowing from the market for the next year would be around
INR 12 trillion, the minister said.

Sitharaman said the preparation of the budget was undertaken in
circumstances like never before.

For Covid-19 vaccination, the government has allocated INR 350 billion.
The government is committed to provide further funds if required, the
minister said. The outlay for [health][3] care was raised by 137 percent
relative to the previous budget.

The government announced a plan to set up a bad bank to manage the
stressed assets of public sector banks. The bad bank will then sell bad
loans to other potential [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s at a reduced price.

Further, the minister announced proposal to privatize two public sector
banks and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22. The
government intends to bring the initial public offering of the life
insurance major the Life Insurance Corporation in fiscal year 2022.

Further, the government allotted INR 200 billion for bank
capitalization.

The government plans to lift the foreign direct investment limit in
insurance companies to 74 percent from 49 percent.

The finance minister also unveiled a voluntary vehicle scrapping [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
to phase out old and unfit vehicles which have been on the road for over
20 years.

In order to provide more funds to farmers, Sitharaman raised the
agriculture credit target to INR 16.5 trillion.

Further, she proposed an Agriculture Infrastructure and Development cess
on a small number of items.

The government rationalized customs duty on gold and silver.
