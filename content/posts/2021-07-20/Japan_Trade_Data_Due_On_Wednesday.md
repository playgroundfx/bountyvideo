Japan will on Wednesday release June figures for imports, exports and
trade balance. Setting the pace for a modest day in Asia-Pacific
economic activity.

Imports are expected to jump 29.0 percent on year, up from 27.9 percent
in May. Exports are called higher by an annual 46.2 percent, slowing
from 49.6 percent in the previous month. The trade surplus is pegged at
460 billion yen following the 187.1 billion yen deficit a month earlier.

Japan also will see the minutes from its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on June
17 and 18. At the meeting, the central bank voted to keep its benchmark
lending rate steady at -0.1 percent. The bank also will continue to
purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds without setting
an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero
percent.

Australia will June results for retail sales and for the leading
economic index from Westpac Bank. Retail sales are tipped to fall 0.5
percent on month after rising 0.4 percent in May. The economic index
dipped 0.06 percent in May.

Thailand will provide June numbers for imports, exports and trade
balance. In May, imports were up 63.54 percent on year and exports
jumped an annual 41.59 percent for a trade surplus of $0.8 billion.
