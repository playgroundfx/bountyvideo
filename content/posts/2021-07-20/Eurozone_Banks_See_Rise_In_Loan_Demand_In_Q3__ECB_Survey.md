Euro area banks expect net demand for loans to firms and households to
increase further in the third quarter as both consumer and [business][1]
confidence improve as the economic activity gains steam.  
  
In the second quarter, banks reported a moderate increase in firm's
demand for loans or drawing of credit lines, results of the latest
quarterly bank lending survey of the European Central Bank showed
Tuesday.  
  
Firms' financing needs for fixed investment contributed positively to
loan demand for the first time since the third quarter of 2019,
suggesting that firms may become less reluctant to invest.

However, their financing needs for working capital remained unchanged
owing to firms' available liquidity buffers and the likely recovery in
revenues given the improving economic situation, the survey said.  
  
Demand for housing loans increased strongly in the second quarter,
underpinned by higher consumer confidence, favorable housing market
prospects and the low general level of interest rates.

Consumer credit and other lending to households also increased in net
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), largely driven by higher consumer confidence and spending on
durables.

Banks also expect credit standards to tighten slightly for loans to
firms and to remain broadly unchanged for households in the third
quarter.
