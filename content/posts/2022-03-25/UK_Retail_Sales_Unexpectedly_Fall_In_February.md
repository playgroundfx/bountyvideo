UK retail sales dropped unexpectedly in February, data from the Office
for National Statistics revealed on Friday.

The retail sales volume dropped 0.3 percent month-on-month, in contrast
to the 1.9 percent increase in January. Sales were forecast to climb 0.6
percent.  
  
Excluding auto fuel, retail sales volume decreased 0.7 percent,
reversing the 1.7 percent increase a month ago. Economists had forecast
a 0.5 percent increase.  
  
Food store sales fell 0.2 percent on month with large falls in alcohol
and tobacco stores, which may be linked to higher spending in pubs and
restaurants.  
  
Meanwhile, non-food store sales advanced 0.6 percent, underpinned by the
13.2 percent rise in clothing and 1.3 percent increase in department
store sales.

Automotive fuel sales volumes rose 3.6 percent in February as the
lifting of Plan B restrictions in England at the end of January
increased travel, data showed.

On a yearly basis, retail sales grew 7.0 percent but slower than the
revised 9.4 percent increase logged in January and the expected 7.8
percent rise.

Similarly, annual growth in retail sales, excluding auto fuel, slowed to
4.6 percent from 7.5 percent in January. Sales were forecast to climb
5.6 percent.
