Revised data released by the University of Michigan on Friday showed
consumer sentiment in the U.S. fell by more than initially estimated in
the month of March.

The report showed the consumer sentiment index for March was downwardly
revised to 59.4 from the preliminary reading of 59.7. Economists had
expected the index to be unrevised.

With the unexpected downward revision, the consumer sentiment was at its
lowest level since hitting 55.8 in August of 2011.

"Inflation has been the primary cause of rising pessimism," said Surveys
of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin. "Inflation was mentioned
throughout the survey, whether the questions referred to personal
finances, prospects for the [economy][1], or assessments of buying
conditions."

He added, "When asked to explain changes in their finances in their own
words, more consumers mentioned reduced living standards due to rising
inflation than any other time except during the two worst recessions in
the past fifty years."

The report showed one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.4 percent
in March from 4.9 percent in February, reaching the highest level since
November 1981.

The current economic conditions index edged down to 67.2 in March from
68.2 in February, while the index of consumer expectations slumped to
54.3 from 59.4.
