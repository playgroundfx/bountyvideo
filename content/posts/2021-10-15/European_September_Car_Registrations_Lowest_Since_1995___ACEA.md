European new car registrations declined for a third month in a row in
September and marked the lowest level for the month since 1995, data
from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, showed
Friday.

Passenger car registrations shrank 23.1 percent year-on-year to 718,598
units in September after a 19.1 percent fall in August.

The latest decline was largely caused by a lack of supply of vehicles
due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, the Brussels-based ACEA said.

All major EU [markets][1] recorded double-digit declines. Italy logged
the worst fall of 32.7 percent, followed by Germany with a 25.7 percent
slump.

Sales decreased 20.5 percent in France and 15.7 percent in Spain.

In the January to September period, car registrations in the EU climbed
6.6 percent from the same period last year to 7.5 million units,
underpinned by significant gains earlier in the year.
