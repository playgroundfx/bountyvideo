A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed U.S.
[business][1] inventories increased in line with economist estimates in
the month of August.

The Commerce Department said business inventories climbed by 0.6 percent
in August, matching the increase seen in the previous month as well as
economist expectations.

Wholesale inventories led the way higher, jumping by 1.2 percent, while
manufacturing inventories rose by 0.6 percent and retail inventories
inched up by 0.1 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed business sales edged down by 0.1 percent in
August after rising by 0.5 percent in July.

A 1.1 percent slump in wholesale sales more than offset a 1.0 percent
surge in retail sales and a 0.1 percent uptick in manufacturing sales.

With inventories rising and sales falling, the total business
inventories/sales ratio crept up to 1.26 in August from 1.25 in July.
