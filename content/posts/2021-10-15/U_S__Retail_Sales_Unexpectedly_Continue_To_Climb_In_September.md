The Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing an
unexpected increase in U.S. retail sales in the month of September.

The report said retail sales climbed by 0.7 percent in September after
jumping by an upwardly revised 0.9 percent in August.

The continued sales growth came as a surprise to economists, who had
expected retail sales to edge down by 0.2 percent compared to the 0.7
percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

A rebound in sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers contributed to the
increase in sales, with auto sales rising by 0.5 percent in September
after plunging by 3.3 percent in August.

Excluding auto sales, however, retail sales advanced by a slightly
stronger 0.8 percent in September after spiking by an upwardly revised
2.0 percent in August.

Economists had expected ex-auto sales to rise by 0.5 percent compared to
the 1.8 percent jump originally reported for the previous month.

Sales by sporting goods, hobby, music and book stores led the way
higher, surging up by 3.7 percent, while sales by general merchandise
stores, gas stations and clothing and accessories stores also saw
notable growth.

The report showed sales by non-store retailers rose by 0.6 percent in
September after soaring by 5.7 percent in August, while sales by food
services and drinking places edged up by 0.3 percent following a 0.2
percent uptick in the previous month.

Closely watched core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline,
building materials and food services, increased by 0.8 percent in
September after jumping by 2.6 percent in August.

"Households are continuously readjusting their spending mix as the Covid
situation evolves and displaying discretion when goods and services are
unavailable or prices are considered too high," said Gregory Daco, Chief
U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Overall though, retail sales remain a healthy 19% higher than
pre-Covid level and core sales are 22% higher, and high frequency data
points to renewed consumer enthusiasm as of early October."
