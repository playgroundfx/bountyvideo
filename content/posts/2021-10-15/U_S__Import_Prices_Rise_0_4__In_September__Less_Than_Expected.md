Import prices in the U.S. increased by less than expected in the month
of September, according to a report released by the Labor Department on
Friday.

The Labor Department said import prices rose by 0.4 percent in September
after dipping by 0.3 percent in August. Economists had expected import
prices to climb by 0.6 percent.

The increase in import prices reflected a substantial rebound in prices
for fuel imports, which spiked by 3.7 percent in September after
plunging by 3.0 percent in August.

Meanwhile, prices for non-fuel imports were unchanged in September after
edging down by 0.1 percent in the previous month.

The report said lower prices for non-fuel industrial supplies and
materials offset higher prices for foods, feeds, and beverages, consumer
goods, and automotive vehicles.

The Labor Department also said export prices inched up by 0.1 percent in
September after rising by 0.4 percent in the previous month. Export
prices were also expected to increase by 0.6 percent.

The uptick in export prices came as prices for non-agricultural exports
rose by 0.3 percent for the second straight month, while prices for
agricultural exports tumbled by 1.7 percent in September after climbing
by 0.9 percent in August.

The sharp pullback in prices for agricultural exports came as steep
drops in prices for soybeans and corn more than offset higher prices for
cotton, wheat, fruit, and vegetables.

Compared to the same month a year ago, import prices in September were
up by 9.2 percent, while export prices were up by 16.3 percent.

"Looking into Q4, import price inflation likely remains stubbornly
elevated amid supply and energy-related price pressures," said Mahir
Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Despite the stickiness, the recent moderation in core
inflation is a good sign that price dynamics won't spiral upward."
