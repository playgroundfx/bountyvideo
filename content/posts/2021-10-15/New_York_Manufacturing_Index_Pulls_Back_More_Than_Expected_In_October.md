A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Friday
showed a notable slowdown in the pace of growth in regional
manufacturing activity in the month of October.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index tumbled
to 19.8 in October from 34.3 in September, although a positive reading
still indicates growth. Economists had expected the index to pull back
to 27.0.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms were still very optimistic
that conditions would improve over the next six months.
