The unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 2.2 percent in March
from 2.3 percent in February. This was in line with economists'
forecast.

On an unadjusted basis, the jobless rate declined to 2.4 percent in
March from 2.5 percent in the previous month. Economists had forecast a
rate of 2.4 percent.

The number of registered unemployed fell to 109,500 persons in March
from 117,970 in February.

The unemployment rate among the youth aged between 15 and 24, decreased
to 1.8 percent in March from 1.9 percent in the previous month.
