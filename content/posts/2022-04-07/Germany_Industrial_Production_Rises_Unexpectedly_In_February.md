Germany industrial production grew unexpectedly in February, data from
Destatis revealed on Thursday.

Industrial output grew 0.2 percent month-on-month in February,
confounding expectations for a fall of 0.2 percent. Nonetheless, this
was slower than the revised 1.4 percent increase posted in January.

Excluding energy and construction, production grew only 0.1 percent in
February.  
On a yearly basis, overall industrial output gained 3.2 percent, faster
than the 1.1 percent rise in the previous month.

Within industry, the production of consumer goods was up 4.4 percent and
intermediate goods by 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, capital goods output
decreased 2.0 percent.

Outside of industry, energy production gained 4.9 percent, while
production in construction fell 0.7 percent.
