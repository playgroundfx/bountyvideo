Germany industrial production increased in February, underpinned by
consumer goods output, data from Destatis revealed on Thursday.

Industrial output grew 0.2 percent month-on-month in February,
confounding expectations for a fall of 0.2 percent. Nonetheless, this
was slower than the revised 1.4 percent increase posted in January.

Excluding energy and construction, production grew only 0.1 percent in
February.

On a yearly basis, overall industrial output gained 3.2 percent, faster
than the 1.1 percent rise in the previous month.

Within industry, the production of consumer goods was up 4.4 percent and
intermediate goods by 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, capital goods output
decreased 2.0 percent.

Outside of industry, energy production gained 4.9 percent, while
production in construction fell 0.7 percent.

Compared with February 2020, the month before restrictions were imposed
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, production was 3.8 percent lower. This gap
in production was likely to be due to the continuing shortage of
intermediate products, because of which many enterprises have problems
completing new orders, Destatis said.

Data released on Wednesday showed factory orders declined for the first
time in four months in February largely driven by the fall in foreign
demand. Orders were down 2.2 percent on a monthly basis.

The [economy][1] ministry noted that the February data practically does
not include any effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The uncertainty about the future course of the economy has increased
massively following the war in Ukraine. The war will initially slow down
the recovery of industrial activity, the ministry added.
