The European Central Bank has turned more hawkish with several
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers makers seeing the need for immediate steps towards [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization as euro area inflation set new highs on the back of
soaring energy prices, minutes of the latest rate-setting session showed
Thursday.  
  
"A large number of members held the view that the current high level of
inflation and its persistence called for immediate further steps towards
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization," the minutes, which the ECB calls
"account" of the Governing Council session held on March 9-10 showed.  
  
There were also concerns that the latest staff projections may be
underestimating the persistence of above-target inflation.

Eurozone inflation rocketed in March to set a new record of 7.5 percent
as Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove energy prices higher. Core
inflation, which excludes prices of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco,
accelerated to 3.0 percent.  
  
The argument that all three forward guidance conditions for an interest
rate hike had either already been met or were very close to being met,
was countered with the view that the persistence of the rise in
indicators could be temporary and that uncertainty was high at the
current juncture.  
  
Further, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers considered it essential to take action at the
present meeting on scaling back the scheduled purchases under the asset
purchase program, or APP, over the following quarters to "unlock"
optionality for future decisions on [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates.

Some members preferred to set a firm end date for APP net purchases
during the summer, thus clearing the way for a possible rate rise in the
third quarter of this year in the light of the deterioration in the
inflation outlook.  
  
Meanwhile, others sought a wait-and-see approach due to the
exceptionally high uncertainty due to the war.  
  
The view was put forward that the war would likely dent economic growth
in the short term, annual growth was projected to remain positive even
in the severe scenario, pointing to "slowflation" rather than
stagflation.

"There was wide support for the conditional expectation that the
Governing Council would conclude net asset purchases under the APP in
the third quarter if the incoming data supported the expectation that
the medium-term inflation outlook would not weaken after the end of net
purchases," the minutes said.  
  
The Governing Council also judged as neither necessary nor advisable to
reach a firm conclusion at the present stage on whether the three
forward guidance conditions for a rate hike had already been met, the
minutes added.  
  
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said ECB will likely make a clear
distinction between [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening.  
  
The next ECB rate setting session is scheduled for April 14.  
  
"Staying put and continuing with the announced reduction of net asset
purchases looks like the only viable option for now," Brzeski said.  
  
"However, given the latest market pricing of future ECB rate hikes and a
lack of clarity around the ECB's exact reaction function in these times
of high uncertainty, ECB President Christine Lagarde could find her
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) somewhat limited."
