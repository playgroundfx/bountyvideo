Dutch consumer price inflation increased sharply to the highest level
since April 1976, driven by soaring energy prices, data from the Central
Bureau of Statistics showed on Thursday.

The consumer price index rose 9.7 percent year-on-year in March,
following a 6.2 percent increase in February.

The latest inflation was mainly due to higher prices for energy, which
rose by 157.0 percent from a year ago.

Price development of motor fuels and food also led to higher rate of
inflation in March, the agency said.

Inflation based on the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, or HICP,
surged to 11.7 percent in March from 7.3 percent in the previous month.
