Austria's consumer price inflation rose to the highest since November
1984, preliminary estimates from Statistics Austria showed on Wednesday.

Consumer prices rose 5.1 percent yearly in January.

"The increase in fuel prices on an annual basis was somewhat less
pronounced in January 2022 than in the previous month of December, but
continued to drive up inflation," Tobias Thomas, director general at
Statistics Austria, said.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 4.6
percent annually in January.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices remained unchanged in January and
HICP rose 0.1 percent.
