The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to expand in January,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed
on Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 53.7.

That's up from 53.5 in December, and it moves farther above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This represented a fifth straight month of improving [business][1]
conditions across the Indonesian manufacturing sector, with the rate of
improvement the strongest since last November.

Demand for Indonesian manufactured goods rose at the fastest rate in
three months at the start of the year which, alongside better production
conditions, contributed to a further steep expansion of manufacturing
output. Supporting the overall increase in sales was stronger foreign
demand, with new export orders rising at the fastest rate on record in
January.
