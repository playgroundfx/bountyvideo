The services sector in Australia fell into contraction January, the
latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on Thursday with a services
PMI score of 46.6.

That's down from 55.1 in December and it moves beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This followed three consecutive months of expansion. The deterioration
of COVID-19 conditions in Australia led to demand falling at the start
of the year. Fear surrounding the resurgence in COVID-19 cases
contributed to lower services consumption. As a result, services output
eased sharply with sub-sector data showing Real Estate & Business
Services leading the drop. Foreign demand was similarly affected,
falling at a faster rate in January.

The survey also showed that the composite PMI sank to 46.7 in January
from 54.9 in December.

Both manufacturing and service sectors output declined in January amid
the surge in COVID-19 infections. While demand for Australian
manufactured goods stayed resilient, services new orders fell according
to the latest survey, weighing on overall demand. Foreign demand was
likewise negatively affected.
