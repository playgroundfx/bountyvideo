Reflecting the impact of the Omicron variant of the [coronavirus][1],
payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday unexpectedly
showing a sharp pullback in U.S. private sector employment in the month
of January.

ADP said private sector employment tumbled by 301,000 jobs in January
after jumping by a downwardly revised 776,000 jobs in December.

The steep drop surprised economists, who had expected private sector
employment to increase by 207,000 jobs compared to the spike of 807,000
jobs originally reported for the previous month.
