South Africa's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged on
Thursday in the backdrop of a stronger economic outlook and rising
inflationary pressures.  
  
The Monetary Policy Committee unanimously decided to keep the repo rate
unchanged at 3.5 percent, the South African Reserve Bank Governor
Lesetja Kganyago said in a statement. The decision was in line with
economists' expectations.

The previous change in the rate was a quarter-point cut in July last
year.  
  
The projected [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate path of the bank indicated an increase of 25
basis points in each of the second and fourth quarters of this year.  
  
"The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance and repurchase rate level remains highly
accommodative, and will remain so even with steps taken to normalize
interest rate levels in response to rising inflation," Kganyago said.

"With inflation expectations remaining stable, and despite inflation
risk increasing, the Committee still expects inflation to be contained
in 2021, before rising to around the midpoint of the inflation target
range in 2022 and 2023."

The SARB raised the growth forecast for this year to 4.2 percent from
3.8 percent, citing better sectoral growth performances and a more
robust [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trade in the first quarter of this year.  
  
The bank estimated that the [economy][1] grew 2.7 percent in the first
quarter, which is much stronger than the 0.2 percent contraction seen in
the March meeting. In the fourth quarter of last year, the economy
expanded 6.3 percent.  
  
Household consumption is expected to be healthy this year, while
investment is expected to remain constrained.  
  
GDP growth is seen at 2.3 percent next year and at 2.4 percent in 2023.  
  
While overall risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be balanced,
the slow progress on vaccinations, limited energy supply and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
uncertainty continue to pose downside risks, the bank said.

Headline inflation forecast for this year was lowered slightly to 4.2
percent from 4.3 percent. Inflation is projected at 4.4 percent next and
4.5 percent in 2023.

The core inflation forecast for this year was lowered to 3.0 percent
from 3.3 percent. The projections for 2022 and 2023 were unchanged at
4.0 percent and 4.3 percent.

The next [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session is on July 22.
