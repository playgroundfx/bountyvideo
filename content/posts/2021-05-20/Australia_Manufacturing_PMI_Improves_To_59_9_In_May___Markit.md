The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in May, and at
a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Friday with a survey record manufacturing PMI score of 59.9.

That's up from 59.7 in April, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

New export orders rose as international demand for both Australian goods
and services expanded at accelerated rates. Specifically, overseas
demand for services increased at the fastest pace on record. With the
strong demand being sustained in May, companies also saw their backlogs
of work increase. The rise was the fourth in successive months and the
steepest in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

The survey also showed that the services PMI eased to 58.2 from 58.8 in
April and the composite fell to 58.1 from 58.9.
