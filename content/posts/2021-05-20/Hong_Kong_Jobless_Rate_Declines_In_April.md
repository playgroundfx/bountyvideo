Hong Kong's unemployment rate decreased in April, the labor force
statistics from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Thursday.

The unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 6.4 percent in three
months to April from 6.8 percent in three months to March.

The underemployment rate decreased to 3.3 percent from 3.8 percent in
the preceding period.

The number of unemployed persons decreased by around 12,300 to 247,500
in February to April. Over the same period, the number of underemployed
persons also declined by around 21,800 to 126,600.

Total employment increased about 7,900 to 3.622 million in three months
to April.

"The labor market saw some improvement lately as the local epidemic
receded," the Secretary for Labor and Welfare, Dr Law Chi-kwong, said.

"Considering that the [business][1] receipts of many labor-intensive
sectors are still far below the pre-recession levels, the labor market
will take time to attain a more visible recovery," Law said.
