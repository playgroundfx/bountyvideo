Estonia's producer prices increased in March, data from Statistics
Estonia showed on Thursday.

The producer price index grew 6.8 percent year-on-year in April.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices rose 1.6 percent in April.

Compared to March, producer prices was affected the most by rising
prices in the manufacturing of wood and wood products, fabricated metal
products and plastic products, Eveli Sokman, leading analyst at
Statistics Estonia, said.

"At the same time, falling prices in the manufacture of fuel oils and
wearing apparel had an opposite impact on the index," Sokman said.

Import prices rose 1.5 percent monthly in April and gained 9.4 percent
from a year ago.

Export prices grew 1.3 percent monthly in April and increased 9.9
percent yearly.
