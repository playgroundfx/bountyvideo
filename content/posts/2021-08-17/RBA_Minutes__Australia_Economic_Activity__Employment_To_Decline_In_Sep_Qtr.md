Policymakers of the Reserve Bank of Australia said the economic activity
and employment were expected to decline in the September quarter as the
high transmissibility of the Delta variant raised the possibility of a
more gradual reopening.

The board said outbreaks of the Delta variant and accompanying lockdowns
had introduced a high degree of uncertainty to the outlook for the
second half of 2021.

Nonetheless, members expect the [economy][1] to rebound from the current
setback later in the year as restrictions are eased, consistent with the
previously observed pattern in Australia and overseas.

The current virus outbreaks and lockdowns had interrupted the recovery
and many households and businesses were facing difficult conditions, the
minutes said. Members therefore considered the case for delaying the
tapering of bond purchases to A$4 billion a week currently scheduled for
September 2021.

"The Board would be prepared to act in response to further bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on
the [health][2] front should that lead to a more significant setback for
the economic recovery," the minutes said.

The board repeated that it will not increase the cash rate until actual
inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. The
central scenario for the economy is that this condition will not be met
before 2024, the board observed.
