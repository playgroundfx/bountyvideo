The total value of non-oil domestic exports in Singapore was up 12.7
percent on year in July, Enterprise Singapore said on Tuesday -
exceeding expectations for 12.0 percent following the 15.9 percent gain
in June.

Growth was mainly due to non-electronics such as specialized machinery,
pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals - while electronics also rose.

NODX to the top 10 [markets][1] as a whole rose in July, mainly due to
China, the EU 27 and Taiwan while NODX to the United States declined.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports fell
0.9 percent - again beating forecasts for a drop of 1.2 percent after
gaining 6.0 percent in the previous month.

The value was worth SGD16.1 billion, down from SGD16.3 billion a month
earlier.
