The Netherlands' exited a recession with strong growth in the second
quarter, underpinned by private consumption and trade, preliminary
estimates from the statistical office CBS showed Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 3.1 percent from the first quarter, when
output fell 0.8 percent. In the fourth quarter, the [economy][1]
stagnated.  
  
In the second quarter of 2020, the economic output had dropped a massive
8.4 percent sequentially as the [coronavirus][2] pandemic severely hurt
economic activity across the world.  
  
Household consumption grew 5.7 percent and state spending increased 2.6
percent. Exports rose 4.0 percent and imports climbed 2.6 percent.
Investments shrunk 1.8 percent.  
  
The trade, transport and hospitality sector, the government sector,
education and care sector and the industrial sector had a major share in
the quarter-on-quarter growth in GDP, the statistical office said.  
  
On a year-on-year basis, the economy grew a record 9.7 percent in the
second quarter, the CBS said. In the first quarter, GDP decreased 2.2
percent annually, revised from 2.4 percent.  
  
"The exceptionally high growth in the second quarter of 2021 is also
mainly the result of a severe lockdown in the second quarter of last
year, when GDP contracted sharply," the CBS said.  
  
The size of the economy in the second quarter of 2021 was still 0.4
percent smaller versus two year ago, the agency added.
