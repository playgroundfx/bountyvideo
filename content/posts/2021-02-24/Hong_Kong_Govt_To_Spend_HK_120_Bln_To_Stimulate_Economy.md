The Hong Kong government plans to spend HK$120 billion to alleviate the
hardship and pressure caused by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, Financial
Secretary Paul Chan said in his 2021-22 budget speech on Wednesday.

The [economy][2] shrank 6.1 percent in 2020, which was the largest
annual fall on record and also the first time for Hong Kong to log two
consecutive years of contraction.

Taking into account the internal and external situations as well as the
stimulus effect of the fiscal measures, the economy is projected to grow
by 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent this year.

The economy will grow by an average of 3.3 percent per annum in real
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) from 2022 to 2025, while the underlying inflation rate will
average 2 percent, Chan said.

After two consecutive years of contraction, overall economic activities
will remain below the pre-recession level this year and should not pose
notable pressure on local costs, he noted. Inflation and the underlying
inflation will be 1.6 percent and 1 percent, respectively this year.

In order to stimulate local consumption, the government will issue
vouchers worth HK$5000 to each residents.

The government has allocated HK$9.5 billion to support enterprises. Chan
reduced profits tax for the assessment year 2020-21 by 100 percent and
provided rates concession for non-domestic properties for four quarters
of 2021-22.

Further, [business][3] registration fees for 2021-22 were waived, which
is likely to benefit 1.5 million business operators.

The government has introduced a number of enhancements to the SME
Financing Guarantee Scheme.

In 2020-21, the government created about 31,000 time-limited jobs in the
public and private sectors. Chan proposed to further allocate HK$6.6
billion to create around 30,000 time-limited jobs for a period up to 12
months.

He raised the stamp duty on stock transfers to 0.13 percent from the
current 0.1 percent.

Chan said that the fiscal deficit will be HK$101.6 billion next fiscal
year, accounting for 3.6 percent of GDP, due to the counter-cyclical
fiscal measures. The operating deficit for 2021-22 will be more than
HK$140 billion, he added.
