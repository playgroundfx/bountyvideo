The German [economy][1] grew more than initially estimated in the fourth
quarter driven by construction investment and exports, revised data from
Destatis showed on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.3 percent sequentially in the fourth
quarter instead of 0.1 percent estimated previously. However, this was
much slower than the 8.5 percent rebound seen in the third quarter due
to the renewed lockdown at the end of the year.  
  
On a yearly basis, the decline in GDP slowed to 3.7 percent from 4
percent. The fourth quarter rate was revised from -3.9 percent.  
  
The price-adjusted GDP dropped 2.7 percent annually after easing 3.9
percent in the third quarter. According to flash estimate, GDP was down
2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

Due to the second lockdown, private consumption dropped 3.3 percent but
this was far less than the 11 percent fall posted during the first
lockdown. Government spending also decreased 0.5 percent.

Growth impulses came from construction investment, which was up 1.8
percent. Further, foreign trade contributed to the growth. Exports
increased 4.5 percent sequentially and imports climbed 3.7 percent.

Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist, said industrial activity and foreign
demand helped to stop the German economy from falling into contraction
during the second lockdown but it is very unlikely they will again prove
to be strong insurance against contraction in the fourth quarter.

The statistical office revised its full year GDP estimate for 2020 to
-4.9 percent from -5 percent.

In its monthly report, released this week, Bundesbank said the German
economy is likely to recover from this spring after an estimated
contraction in the first quarter of 2021.
