French manufacturing confidence improved marginally in February despite
continuing [health][1] crisis, the statistical office Insee said on
Wednesday.

The manufacturing confidence index rose less-than-expected to 97 in
February from 96 in January. The expected level was 99.

Industrialists' opinion on overall order books improved in February with
the balance rising to -25 from -29. The balance of opinion on foreign
order books also increased to -32 from -34.

The survey showed that industrialists were a little more optimistic
about their personal production prospects, confirming the rebound
following the exit from the second lockdown. The corresponding score
rose to 10 from 8.

The balance on general production prospects in the French industrial
sector also picked up a little, after a decline in January. The index
came in at -8 versus -10 in the previous month.

Regarding employment, the opinion of industrialists remained essentially
unchanged in February. The balances on expected and past change in
workforce size dropped one point each to -8 and -10, respectively.

Due to the weakness in the tertiary sectors, especially services and
retail trade, the overall [business][2] confidence index dropped to 90
in February from 91 a month ago.
