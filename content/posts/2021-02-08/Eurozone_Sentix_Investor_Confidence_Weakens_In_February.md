Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence dropped in February as the slower pace of
vaccination weighed on both the assessment of current situation and
expectations, survey data from Sentix showed on Monday.

The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index fell unexpectedly to -0.2 in February from
+1.3 in the previous month. Economists had forecast the index to rise to
1.9.

The current situation index declined to -27.5 from -26.5 in January.
Likewise, the expectations index dropped to 31.5 from 33.5.

A permanent prolongation of the lockdown could become a problem because
the difference between expectation and the current situation is
extremely high, the lobby said. "There is a potential for a temporary
disillusionment here," Sentix said.

In Germany, the [business][1] sentiment index came in at 8.6 in
February, down from 9.2 in January.

While the current situation index rose to -15.5, the highest since March
2020, the expectations index fell to 35.8 from 37.5.
