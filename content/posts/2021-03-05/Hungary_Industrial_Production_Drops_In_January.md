Hungary's industrial production declined for the first time in four
months in January, data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office
showed on Friday.

Industrial production declined a working-day adjusted 2.8 percent year-
on-year in January, after a 1.0 percent increase in December.

The industrial production volume decreased 6.7 percent yearly in
January, after a 5.8 percent growth in the previous month. Economists
had forecast a 4.0 percent fall.

A decline in production was observed in manufacture of transport
equipment and food products, beverages and tobacco, while a growth was
seen in manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products, the
agency said.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production rose 0.2 percent
monthly in January, after a 2.7 percent decline in the prior month.
