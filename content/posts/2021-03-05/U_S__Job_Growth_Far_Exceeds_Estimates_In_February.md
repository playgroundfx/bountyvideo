Reflecting a significant rebound in employment in the leisure and
hospitality industry, the Labor Department released a report on Friday
showing much stronger than expected U.S. job growth in the month of
February.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 379,000
jobs in February after climbing by an upwardly revised 166,000 jobs in
January.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 182,000 jobs compared
to the uptick of 49,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The stronger than expected job growth was primarily due to a rebound in
employment in the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 355,000
jobs.

The report showed smaller job gains in temporary help services,
[health][1] care and social assistance, retail trade, and manufacturing,
while employment declined in state and local government education,
construction, and mining.

"Even with upward revisions to the gain in January and the strength last
month, employment is still 9.5 million short of the pre-pandemic level,
with 3.5 million of those jobs lost in the leisure and hospitality
sector specifically," said Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at
Capital Economics.

He added, "Nevertheless, with COVID case numbers still falling sharply,
more large-scale fiscal stimulus on the way and the vaccination program
likely to reach critical mass before mid-year, the U.S. is well-placed
to recover a significant number of those lost jobs this year."

With the stronger than expected job growth, the unemployment rate
unexpectedly edged down to 6.2 percent in February from 6.3 percent in
January. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to remain
unchanged.

The unexpected dip in the unemployment rate came as household employment
rose by 208,000 persons compared with a 50,000-person increase in the
size of labor force.

The modest decrease pulled the unemployment rate down to its lowest
level since hitting 4.4 percent last March, when
[coronavirus][2]-related lockdowns began to take effect.

The Labor Department also said average hourly employee earnings crept up
$0.07 or 0.2 percent to $30.01 in February. Annual wage growth was
unchanged from the previous month at 5.3 percent.
