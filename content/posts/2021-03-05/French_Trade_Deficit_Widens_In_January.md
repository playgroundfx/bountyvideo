The French trade deficit increased in January from the prior month as
growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports, data from the customs
office showed on Friday.

The trade deficit widened to EUR 3.94 billion from EUR 3.57 billion in
December. In the same period last year, the shortfall was EUR 5.23
billion.

Exports grew 2.8 percent on month and imports climbed 3.5 percent in
January from the previous month.

On a yearly basis, exports and imports decreased 4.8 percent and 6.6
percent, respectively.
