Reflecting a significant rebound in employment in the leisure and
hospitality industry, the Labor Department released a report on Friday
showing much stronger than expected U.S. job growth in the month of
February.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment jumped by 379,000
jobs in February after climbing by an upwardly revised 166,000 jobs in
January.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 182,000 jobs compared
to the uptick of 49,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

With the stronger than expected job growth, the unemployment rate
unexpectedly edged down to 6.2 percent in February from 6.3 percent in
January. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to remain
unchanged.
