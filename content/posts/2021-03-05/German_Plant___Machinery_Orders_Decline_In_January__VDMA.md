German manufacturers received less orders for plant and machinery in
January compared to a year ago, largely due to the base effect.

New orders for plant and machinery decreased 10 percent year-on-year,
the mechanical engineering industry body VDMA said Friday.

"Since there had been unusually high orders for large-scale plant
[business][1] from Germany and abroad in January 2020, the bar was set
very high for the year-on-year comparison," VDMA chief economist Ralph
Wiechers said.  
  
"In addition, some companies had longer plant holidays scheduled over
the turn of the year."

Domestic orders fell 22 percent year-on-year and foreign demand shrunk 5
percent.

Demand from euro area countries declined 1 percent and orders from non-
euro countries decreased 6 percent.

The economist said the comparatively better export [economy][2] for some
months, especially towards Asia, checked the decline in overall demand.  
  
In the November to January period, orders stagnated compared to a year
ago with a 6 percent slump in domestic demand and a 3 percent increase
in foreign bookings.
