China's government has set growth target for 2021, at the annual
parliamentary meeting on Friday, as it recovers from the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

At the opening of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Keqiang
announced that the government targets to achieve above 6 percent
economic growth this year.

In 2020, the government avoided setting an annual growth target due to
uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

"A target of over 6% will enable all of us to devote full energy to
promoting reform, innovation, and high-quality development," Li said.

The [economy][2] had expanded 2.3 percent last year, making China the
only major economy to avoid a contraction amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, this was the weakest growth since 1970s.

The very low GDP growth target for 2021 seems like there was no target
at all because the consensus was 8 percent and ING's forecast of 7
percent, Iris Pang, an economist at ING said.

The fiscal deficit is expected to be about 3.2 percent of GDP compared
to 3.6 percent in 2020.

Li said there are impediments to consumer spending. The latest
government work report has focused on [technology][3] development and
investment in research.

The surveyed jobless rate in urban areas is projected to reach 5.5
percent this year. The government plans to create more than 11 million
urban jobs compared to over 9 million employment in 2020.

The government forecast consumer prices to rise around 3 percent in
2021.
