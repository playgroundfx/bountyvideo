Non-oil domestic exports climbed 6.6 percent on month in December,
Enterprise Singapore said on Monday.

That beat expectations for an increase of 3.6 percent following the
upwardly revised 3.7 percent decline in November (originally -3.8
percent).

On a yearly basis, non-oil domestic exports jumped 6.8 percent - again
exceeding expectations for an increase of 0.3 percent following the
downwardly revised 5.0 percent contraction in the previous month
(originally -4.9 percent).

Singapore posted a trade surplus of SGD6.20 billion last month, roughly
in line with expectations following the SGD3.93 billion surplus a month
earlier.
