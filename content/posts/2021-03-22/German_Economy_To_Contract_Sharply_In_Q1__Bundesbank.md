The German [economy][1] is likely to shrink sharply in the first quarter
of 2021, Bundesbank said in its monthly report, on Monday.

The central bank cautioned that service sector activity is set to drop
sharply again due to the Covid-19 containment measures. Experts assumed
that in addition to Covid-19 related measures, the higher VAT rates
since the beginning of the year also played a role.

The central bank noted that industrial output decreased slightly at the
start of the year but export increased.
