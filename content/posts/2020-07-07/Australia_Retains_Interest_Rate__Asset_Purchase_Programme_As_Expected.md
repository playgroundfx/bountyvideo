Australia's central bank kept its key interest rate at a record low and
the target yield on three-year government bonds unchanged, and vowed to
maintain its accommodative approach as long as required amid the global
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The board of Reserve Bank of Australia, governed by Philip Lowe, decided
to maintain cash rate and the targeted yield on three-year government
bonds of 25 basis points. The outcome of the meeting came in line with
expectations.

The bank said it is prepared to scale-up its bond purchases again and
will do whatever is necessary to ensure bond [markets][2] remain
functional and to achieve the yield target for 3-year Australian
government securities.

The RBA had reduced the key interest rate to the current record low of
0.25 percent at the March meeting. Also in March, the bank had
introduced asset purchase programme to combat the downturn caused by the
pandemic.

Although economic conditions have stabilized recently and the downturn
has been less severe than earlier expected, the bank noted that the
nature and speed of the economic recovery remains highly uncertain.

Uncertainty about the [health][3] situation and the future strength of
the [economy][4] is making many households and businesses cautious, and
this is affecting consumption and investment plan, the bank observed.

As the economy is going through a very difficult period, it is likely
that fiscal and monetary support will be required for some time, the
bank said.

The bank pledged to maintain its accommodative approach as long as it is
required.

The board will not increase the cash rate target until progress is being
made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be
sustainably within the 2-3 percent target band, the bank added.
