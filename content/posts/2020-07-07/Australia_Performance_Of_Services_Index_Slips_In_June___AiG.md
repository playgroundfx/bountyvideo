The services sector in Australia continued to contract in June, and at a
slightly faster rate, the latest survey from the Australian Industry
Group showed on Tuesday with a seasonally adjusted Performance of
Services Index score of 31.5.

That's down slightly from 31.6 in May and it moves farther beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Reduced customer demand continued to drag down most businesses across
all services sectors in June. Some respondents reported the instant
asset tax write-off had a positive effect on sales as did end of
financial year discounting.

Consumer sales have been impacted by uncertainty, tightening income and
falling employment. Some [business][1]-oriented respondents reported
that a lack of work in the pipeline was creating uncertainty about the
outlook after current projects had finished.
