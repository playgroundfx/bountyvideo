Taiwan's consumer prices fell further in June, but at a slower pace,
mainly due to the fall in prices of fuels and lubricants, data from the
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics showed on
Tuesday.

The consumer price index fell 0.76 percent year-on-year in June,
following a 1.19 percent decrease in May. Economists had expected a 0.87
percent decline.

Prices of fuels and lubricants fell 21.75 percent as the international
oil prices plummeted.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.79 percent in June.

Excluding fruits, vegetables and energy, core consumer prices increased
0.13 percent annually in June and rose 0.12 percent from the previous
month.

Data showed that the wholesale prices declined 10.36 percent annually in
June, following a 12.15 percent fall in the preceding month.

On a monthly basis, wholesale prices rose 1.22 percent in June.
