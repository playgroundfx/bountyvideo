US economic recovery may be "leveling off" as activity could be dampened
amid a recent surge in [coronavirus][1] infections, Raphael Bostic,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview
to the Financial Times.

Bostic cited high-frequency data that signaled that the economic
activity may be stalling both in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of [business][2] reopenings and
mobility, the interview published on the FT [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) on Tuesday said.

"There are a couple of things that we are seeing and some of them are
troubling and might suggest that the trajectory of this recovery is
going to be a bit bumpier than it might otherwise," Bostic told FT.

The Fed is watching the trends very closely to understand exactly what's
happening, he added.

On Monday, analysts at Goldman Sachs projected that the US [economy][3]
is set to shrink at a faster rate this year than expected earlier. They
expect the economy to be back on track in September.

Analysts at the investment bank said the healthy rebound in consumer
services spending seen since mid-April appears likely to stall in July
and August as authorities impose further restrictions to contain the
Covid-19 spread.
