Malaysia's central bank reduced its key interest rate by a quarter-point
to support economic recovery.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia on Tuesday decided
to reduce the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent
as expected.

The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR were
correspondingly reduced to 2.00 percent and 1.50 percent, respectively.

The central bank had reduced its rate by 50 basis points in May.

The bank said it will continue to utilize [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers as appropriate
to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery.

Economic activity contracted sharply in the second quarter due to
measures introduced to contain the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the
committee noted.

Following the gradual and progressive re-opening of the [economy][2]
since early May, economic activities started to recover from the trough
in the second quarter.

The fiscal stimulus packages coupled with monetary and financial
measures will continue to underpin the improving economic outlook, the
bank said.
