The UK [economy][1] is set to expand 15 percent in the third quarter
after a record contraction in the second quarter, if the coronavirus, or
Covid-19, pandemic is contained, the National Institute for Economic and
Social Research said Wednesday.

Official data revealed earlier in the day that the economy shrunk a
record 20.4 percent in the second quarter after a 2.2 percent fall in
the first three months of the year, thus entering a technical recession.

The Office for National Statistics also said it was the first recession
since the global financial crisis of 2009 and the largest one ever
experienced by the UK economy.

Meanwhile, the monthly GDP estimate for June revealed an 8.7 percent
growth, as more firms returned to [business][2] after further relaxation
of the Covid-19 lockdown measures. Yet, the GDP is a sixth below its
level in February.

"Despite the recovery noted in June, the path ahead remains precarious,"
NIESR Senior Economist Kemar Whyte said.

"An extended period of growth will be required to make up the ground
lost in recent months."

The think tank has predicted a 10 percent fall in GDP this year and 6
percent growth next year, on the assumption that there is no resurgence
of the pandemic and no reintroduction of the containment measures.

The NIESR expects the service sector, which forms 80 percent of GDP, to
grow 14 percent, and production to expand 16.1 percent in the third
quarter. Manufacturing output is forecast to jump 20.3 percent and
construction to surge around 35 percent.
