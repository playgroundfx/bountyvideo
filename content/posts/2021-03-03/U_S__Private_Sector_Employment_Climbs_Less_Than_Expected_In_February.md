Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing private
sector employment in the U.S. increased by much less than expected in
the month of February.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 117,000 jobs in February
after climbing by an upwardly revised 195,000 jobs in January.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 177,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 174,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.
