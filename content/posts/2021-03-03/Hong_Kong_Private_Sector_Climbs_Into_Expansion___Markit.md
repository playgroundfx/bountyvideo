The private sector in Hong Kong moved into expansion territory in
February, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on Wednesday
with a services PMI score of 50.2.

That's up from 47.8 in January, and it moves above the boom-or-bust line
of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, activity and new orders were down but at much weaker
rates. Purchase cost inflation reached a 31-month high, while firms were
optimistic for the first time since 2018.

The improvement in [business][1] conditions reflected a waning negative
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the latest wave of infections eased
off.
