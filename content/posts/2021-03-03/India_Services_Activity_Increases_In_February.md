The IHS Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.3 in
February from 52.8 in January.

and quickened from January.

of fiscal year 2020/21 after coming out of technical recession in Q3,
and the latest improvement in the PMI indicators points to a strong
expansion in the fourth quarter should growth momentum be sustained in
March," Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit,
said.
