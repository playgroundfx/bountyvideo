A Federal Reserve report known as the Beige Book was released Wednesday
and said economic activity expanded modestly from January to mid-
February for most Fed districts.

The Beige Book, a compilation of economic evidence from the twelve Fed
districts, also said most businesses remain optimistic regarding the
outlook for the next 6-12 months as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely
distributed.

The Fed described the district reports on consumer spending and auto
sales as mixed while noting overall conditions in the leisure and
hospitality sector continued to be restrained by ongoing COVID-19
restrictions.

The report also said most districts saw moderate increases in overall
manufacturing activity despite challenges from supply chain disruptions.

With regard to employment, the Beige Book said most districts reported
that employment levels rose over the reporting period, albeit slowly.

"Labor demand varied considerably by industry and by skill level, and
many [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s noted continued difficulties attracting and retaining
qualified workers," the Fed said.

The report said labor supply shortages were most acute among low-skill
occupations and skilled trade positions, with the constraints on labor
supply including those related to COVID-19, childcare, and unemployment
benefits.

On the inflation front, the Beige Book described the increase in non-
labor input costs as moderate but highlighted notable increases in steel
and lumber prices.

The Fed noted the rise in costs was widely attributed to supply chain
disruptions and to strong overall demand.

Looking ahead, several Fed districts reported anticipating modest price
increases over the next several months.

The release of the Beige Book comes two weeks ahead of the Federal
Reserve's next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, which is scheduled for March
16-17.
