Consumer prices in South Korea were up 0.5 percent on quarter in
February, Statistics Korea said on Thursday.

That exceeded expectations for a gain of 0.3 percent following the 0.8
percent increase in January.

On a yearly basis, inflation was up 1.1 percent - again exceeding
forecasts for a gain of 1.0 percent following the 0.6 percent increase
in the previous month.

Core CPI was up 0.1 percent on month and 0.3 percent on year after
adding 0.4 percent both on month and on year in January.
