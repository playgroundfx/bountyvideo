South Korea's gross domestic product gained a seasonally adjusted 1.2
percent on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Bank of Korea said
in Thursday's final reading.

That beat forecasts for an increase of 1.1 percent following the 2.1
percent gain in the previous three months.

On a yearly basis, GDP was down 1.2 percent - again exceeding
expectations for a decline of 1.4 percent following the 1.1 percent drop
in the three months prior.

For all of 2020, GDP was down 1.0 percent after gaining 2.0 percent in
2019.
