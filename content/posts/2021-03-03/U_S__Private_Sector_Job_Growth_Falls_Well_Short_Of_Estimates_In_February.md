Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing private
sector employment in the U.S. increased by much less than expected in
the month of February.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 117,000 jobs in February
after climbing by an upwardly revised 195,000 jobs in January.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 177,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 174,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics said the
slowdown in job growth is a "disappointment given that the drop-off in
[coronavirus][1] case numbers and the resulting lifting of containment
measures should be giving the [economy][2] a bigger shot in the arm."

The report showed employment in the service-providing sector increased
by 131,000 jobs, reflecting notable job growth in
trade/transportation/utilities and [health][3] care/social assistance.

Employment in leisure/hospitality edged up by 26,000 jobs, which
Ashworth called "suspiciously low given the extent of the rebound in the
high frequency data from Opentable on in-person dining."

Meanwhile, ADP said employment in the goods-producing sector dipped by
14,000 jobs amid decreases in both manufacturing and construction jobs.

The report also showed employment at mid-sized businesses rose by 57,000
jobs, while small and large businesses added 32,000 jobs and 28,000
jobs, respectively.

"The labor market continues to post a sluggish recovery across the
board," said Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist. "We're seeing
large-sized companies increasingly feeling the effects of COVID-19,
while job growth in the goods producing sector pauses."

She added "With the pandemic still in the driver's seat, the service
sector remains well below its pre-pandemic levels; however, this sector
is one that will likely benefit the most over time with reopenings and
increased consumer confidence."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to increase by 180,000 jobs in
February after rising by 49,000 jobs in January. The unemployment rate
is expected to hold at 6.3 percent.
