The current account deficit for the year ended 30 September 2021 widened
to NZ$15.9 billion (4.6 percent of GDP) from the NZ$2.4 billion deficit
for the September 2020 year (0.7 percent of GDP).

The seasonally adjusted goods deficit widened to NZ$1.9 billion, while
the services deficit widened to NZ$749 million.

The primary income deficit narrowed to NZ$1.8 billion, while the
financial account saw a net inflow of MZ$9.3 billion.
