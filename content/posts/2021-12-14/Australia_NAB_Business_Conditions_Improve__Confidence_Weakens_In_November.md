Australia's [business][1] conditions improved moderately in November as
the post-lockdown rebound impact waned, while confidence weakened
notably from October, survey results from NAB showed on Tuesday.

The business conditions index rose to 12 in November from 10 in the
previous month.

The improvement in conditions was driven by employment, which rose 5
points to +11 index points. At the same time, trading conditions and
profitability were largely steady in November.

"There is still scope for things to improve further in coming months,
particularly in recreation & personal services which was still in
negative territory in November despite many restrictions easing in the
month," NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster, said.  
  
The survey showed that business confidence index dropped to 12 from 20
in the previous month.

"Confidence remains high across states and industries, albeit it has
come back to earth a little after the optimism associated with the end
of lockdowns," Oster added.  
  
Oster said notwithstanding the possibility of new disruptions related to
the Omicron variant, the [economy][2] is well placed to carry the
momentum forward over coming months and into 2022.
