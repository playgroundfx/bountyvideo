The UK unemployment rate dropped in the three months to October even
after the government's furlough scheme ended in September, and job
vacancies increased to a new record high, the official data showed on
Tuesday.

The unemployment rate dropped to 4.2 percent during August to October,
the Office for National Statistics said. The rate came in line with
economists' expectations and down from 4.3 percent in three months to
September.

At the same time, the employment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points
on the quarter, to 75.5 percent.

In three months to October, average pay including bonuses grew 4.9
percent from the previous year, bigger than the economists' forecast of
4.6 percent.

Likewise, excluding bonuses, regular pay was up 4.3 percent, which was
larger than the expected rate of 4 percent.

The ONS said previous months' strong earnings growth rates were affected
upwards by base and compositional effects. Nonetheless, a small amount
of base effect for certain sectors may still be present.

In November, payroll employment increased 257,000 from October to 29.4
million.

Data showed that the number of job vacancies continued to rise to a new
record of 1,219,000 in September to November period.

In November, the Bank of England signaled a rate hike this month if the
labor market stays tight.

Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said although the labor
market remains fairly strong even after the furlough scheme ended on
September 30, the BoE is likely to wait for more [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on Omicron before
raising rates.

The strength of the labor market, however, probably means that it is a
case of rate hikes being delayed beyond December rather than being
COVID-cancelled, the economist added.

The interest rates may start rising from February 2022, but only if
concerns over the new variant of Covid-19 have faded, BCC Head of
Economics, Suren?Thiru, said.
