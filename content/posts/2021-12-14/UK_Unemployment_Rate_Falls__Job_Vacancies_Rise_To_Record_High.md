The UK unemployment rate dropped in three months to October and job
vacancies increased to a new record high, the Office for National
Statistics said Tuesday.

The unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points from the previous
three months to 4.2 percent during August to October. The rate came in
line with economists' expectations.

At the same time, the employment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points
on the quarter, to 75.5 percent.

In three months to October, average pay including bonuses grew 4.9
percent from the previous year, bigger than the economists' forecast of
4.6 percent.

Likewise, excluding bonuses, regular pay was up 4.3 percent, which was
larger than the expected rate of 4 percent. The ONS said previous
months' strong growth rates were affected upwards by base and
compositional effects. Nonetheless, a small amount of base effect for
certain sectors may still be present.

Data showed that the number of job vacancies continued to rise to a new
record of 1,219,000 in September to November period.
