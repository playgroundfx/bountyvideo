Sweden's consumer price inflation rose to the highest in over a decade
in November, figures from Statistics Sweden showed on Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 3.3 percent annually in November, after a
2.8 percent increase in October.

The latest inflation was the highest since August 2011, when prices rose
3.4 percent annually. Economists had expected a rise of 3.2 percent.

The major contribution came from higher prices for electricity and fuel,
the agency said.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in November,
following a 0.2 percent growth in the previous month. Economists had
forecast an increase of 0.4 percent.

Inflation, based on the CPI with fixed interest rate or CPIF, increased
to 3.6 percent in November from 3.1 percent in the preceding month.
Economists had expected a 3.4 percent rise.

That was the highest CPIF inflation rate since December 1993 and was
attributed mainly to higher prices for electricity and fuel.

On a monthly basis, the CPIF rose 0.5 percent in November, following a
0.2 percent increase in the prior month. Economists had forecast a 0.3
percent growth.
