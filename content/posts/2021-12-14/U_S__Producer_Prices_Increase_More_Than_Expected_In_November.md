The Labor Department released a report on Tuesday showing U.S. producer
prices increased by more than expected in the month of November.

The report said the producer price index for final demand advanced by
0.8 percent in November after climbing by 0.6 percent in October.
Economists had expected producer prices to rise by 0.5 percent.

Excluding food, energy and trade prices, core producer prices increased
by 0.7 percent in November after rising by 0.4 percent in October.

With the stronger than expected monthly price growth, the annual rate of
producer price growth accelerated to 9.6 percent in November from 8.8
percent in October.

The Labor Department said the year-over-year spike reflected the largest
advance since 12-month data were first calculated in November 2010.
