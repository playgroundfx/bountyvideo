Eurozone industrial production recovered unexpectedly in October, data
from Eurostat revealed on Tuesday.

Industrial output grew 1.1 percent on a monthly basis, reversing a 0.2
percent fall in September. Economists had forecast the production to
fall 0.5 percent in October.

Among main industrial grouping, capital goods output posted the biggest
monthly increase of 3 percent in October. Production of durable consumer
goods gained 1.7 percent and non-durable consumer goods output moved up
0.4 percent.

Energy output rose only 0.1 percent on month. Meanwhile, intermediate
goods output logged a decline of 0.6 percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial output climbed 3.3 percent, but slower
than the 5.1 percent expansion seen in the previous month and also
economists' forecast of +4.1 percent.  
  
Industrial production in the EU27 advanced 1.2 percent on month, taking
the annual growth to 3.6 percent in October.
