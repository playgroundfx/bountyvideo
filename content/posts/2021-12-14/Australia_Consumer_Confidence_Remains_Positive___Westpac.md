Consumer confidence in Australia held in positive territory in November,
the latest survey from Westpac Bank revealed on Wednesday as its index
for sentiment slipped 1.0 percent to a score of 104.3 - remaining above
100 and in the green.

There was a clear difference in responses between the states hit hardest
by recent Delta outbreaks and the rest of Australia. Both NSW and
Victoria posted significant falls (down 3.6 percent and 3.5 percent
respectively) while sentiment was up in Queensland (3.4 percent), WA
(3.2 percent) and SA (7.1 percent).

While high vaccination rates have allowed the 'Delta states' to reopen,
there appears to be a heightened sensitivity to virus developments in
those states where there is likely more concern about the newly emerging
Omicron strain and the continued circulation of COVID locally.
