UK consumer confidence weakened for the third straight month in October,
survey results from the market research group GfK showed on Friday.

The consumer confidence index fell to -17 in October from -13 in
September. The expected reading was -16.

All the sub-indices of confidence index declined in October from the
previous month. The survey was conducted among a sample of 2,000
individuals between October 1 and 13.

The index measuring changes in past personal finances dropped one point
to -5. Similarly, the forecast for personal finances over the next
twelve months fell four points to +1.

The measure for the general economic situation over the last twelve
months was down three points at -46. At the same time, expectations for
the general economic situation over the coming year decreased ten points
to -26.

The Major Purchase Index declined four points to -10 in October.
Meanwhile, the Savings Index stayed unchanged at +22 in October.

"Against a backdrop of cheerless domestic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) - fuel and food
shortages, surging inflation squeezing household budgets, the likelihood
of interest rate rises impacting the cost of borrowing, and climbing
Covid rates - it is not surprising that consumers are feeling down-in-
the mouth about the chilly winter months ahead," Joe Staton, client
strategy director GfK, said.

Worryingly for British retailing in the run-up to Christmas, there is a
further decline in the intention to make major purchases. The financial
mood of the nation has changed and consumers could do with some strong
tonic to lift their spirits, Staton added.
