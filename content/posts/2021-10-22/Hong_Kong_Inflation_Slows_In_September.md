Hong Kong's consumer price inflation eased in September, data from the
Census and Statistics Department showed on Thursday.

The composite consumer price index rose 1.4 percent year-on-year in
September, after a 1.6 percent increase in August. Economists had
expected 3.0 percent rise.

Excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, the
composite consumer price index increased 1.0 percent yearly in
September, after a 1.2 percent rise in the previous month.

"Looking ahead, while overall inflationary pressures will likely
increase in the near term alongside the continued economic recovery and
rising import prices, the underlying inflation should remain largely
moderate in the rest of the year as the local [economy][1] is still
operating below capacity," a government spokesman said.
