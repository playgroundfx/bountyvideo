Russia's central bank hiked the key interest rate further, citing
substantially high inflation and significant upside risks to the
outlook, and signaled more hikes if price pressures remain high in
future.

The Board of Directors decided to raise the key interest rate by 75
basis points to 7.50 percent, the Bank of Russia said in a statement on
Friday. Economists had expected a hike to 7.25 percent.

Inflation is turning out to be substantially above the forecast and is
expected to be within the range of 7.4-7.9 percent at the end of this
year, the bank said in a statement.  
  
The bank noted that the contribution of persistent factors to inflation
remains considerable amid the faster growth in demand relative to output
expansion capacity.  
  
"In this environment, given that inflation expectations are up again,
the balance of risks for inflation is markedly tilted to the upside,"
the bank said.  
  
Consequently, the bank expects a more sustained deviation of inflation
from the target of 4 percent.  
  
"If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank
of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate rises at its
upcoming meetings," the central bank said.  
  
The central bank forecast annual inflation to ease to 4.0-4.5 percent in
2022 and to remain close to 4 percent thereafter.
