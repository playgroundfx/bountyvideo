The value of core machine orders in Japan tumbled a seasonally adjusted

standing at 752.6 billion yen.

That missed estimates for a fall of 8.6 percent following the 0.4
percent drop in March.

Ona yearly basis, core machine orders sank 17.7 percent - again missing
forecasts for a fall of 14.0 percent following the 0.7 percent decline
in the previous month.

For the second quarter of 2020, core machine orders are now forecast to
have fallen 0.9 percent on quarter and 10.4 percent on year.

Government orders were down 7.2 percent on quarter and 5.2 percent on
year to 259.8 billion yen, while orders from overseas plunged 21.6
percent on month and 16.8 percent on year to 689.4 billion yen. Orders
through agencies retreated 8.9 percent on month and 17.8 percent on year
to 105.3 billion yen.

The total value of machinery orders received by 280 manufacturers
operating in Japan fell 8.3 percent on month in April.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan said that producer prices in Japan
were down 0.4 percent on month in May, missing expectations for a drop
of 0.3 percent following the 1.5 percent slide in April.

On a yearly basis, producer prices sank 2.7 percent - again missing
expectations for a fall of 2.4 percent after losing 2.3 percent in the
previous month.

Export prices were down 1.2 percent on month and 6.5 percent on year,
the bank said, while import prices tumbled 5.6 percent on month and 17.6
