After reporting the biggest drop in U.S. consumer prices in over a
decade in the previous month, the Labor Department released a report on
Wednesday showing a modest decrease in consumer prices in the month of
May.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index edged down by 0.1
percent in May after slumping by 0.8 percent in April. Economists had
expected consumer prices to come in unchanged.

The dip in consumer prices came amid a continued decrease in energy
prices, which tumbled by 1.8 percent in May after plunging by 10.1
percent in the previous month. Prices for gasoline and fuel oil showed
notable declines.

Meanwhile, the report said food prices increased by 0.7 percent in May
following a 1.5 percent jump in April. The continued growth was driven
by higher prices for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs, with the beef index
showing its largest ever monthly increase.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices also slipped by
0.1 percent in May after falling by 0.4 percent in April. Core prices
were also expected to come in unchanged.

The modest drop in core prices reflected significant decreases in prices
for motor vehicle insurance and apparel as well as lower prices for
airline fares and used cars and trucks.

Higher prices for shelter, recreation, medical care, household
furnishings and operations, and new vehicles helped limit the downside.

Compared to the same month a year ago, consumer prices in May were up by
just 0.1 percent following the 0.3 percent increase in April.

The annual rate of growth in core consumer prices also slowed to 1.2
percent in May from 1.4 percent in April.

"Overall, there is little evidence that the pandemic is resulting in
widespread downward pressure on prices and, with the initial impact of
the earlier plunge in demand now fading, we doubt core inflation will
fall further from here," said Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at
Capital Economics.

He added, "Nevertheless, with inflation likely to remain well below the
Fed's target, that is another reason to expect [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to remain ultra-
loose for the foreseeable future."

On Thursday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on producer price inflation in the month of May.

Producer prices are expected to inch up by 0.1 percent in May after
tumbling by 1.3 percent in April, while core prices are expected to edge
down by 0.1 percent after falling by 0.3 percent in the previous month.
