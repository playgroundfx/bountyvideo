Slovakia industrial production declined at a record pace in April, data
from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic showed on Wednesday.

Industrial production fell a working day adjusted 42.0 percent year-on-
year in April, following a 19.6 percent decrease in March. This was the
worst fall since the survey began.

This was influenced by a cessation or restriction of the production at
four Slovak car manufacturers as well as the production restrictions at
subcontractors in the car industry as a whole, which responded to the
measures taken against the spread of the COVID-19 in Europe, the agency
said.

Manufacturing output declined 47.4 percent in April.

Production of transport equipment plummeted 78.9 percent.

Output in mining and quarrying declined 0.3 percent, and electricity,
gas, steam and air conditioning sector output fell 3.7 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production declined 26.6 percent in
April.
