China's bank lending declined but credit growth improved in May, data
from the People's Bank of China showed Tuesday.

Bank lending decreased to CNY 1.48 trillion from CNY 1.7 trillion in
April.

The broad measure of money supply, M2, climbed 11.1 percent annually at
the end of May, the same rate as seen in April.

Meanwhile, total social financing, a broad measure of credit and
liquidity in the [economy][1], totaled CNY 3.19 trillion in May compared
to CNY 3.09 trillion a month ago.

The acceleration in credit growth has further to run and will add fuel
to the economic recovery, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

At the annual session of the National People's Congress last month,
Premier Li Keqiang said the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be more flexible and
the country will use a variety of tools including reserve requirement
ratio cuts and interest rate reductions to enable M2 money supply and
aggregate financing to rise at higher rates this year.
