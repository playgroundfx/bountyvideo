The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic has triggered the most severe
recession in nearly a century.

As restrictions begin to ease, the path to economic recovery remains
highly uncertain and vulnerable to a second wave of infections, the OECD
said in its latest Economic Outlook, published on Wednesday.

Global economic activity is expected to fall 6 percent in 2020 if a
second wave of infections is avoided. The unemployment rate in the OECD
is forecast to rise to 9.2 percent from 5.4 percent in 2019.

But global GDP will fall 7.6 percent this year in case of a second
outbreak of virus triggering a return to lockdowns.

OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said "Uncertainty is clearly extreme
in the current context, but the implications of that for macroeconomic
policies are not symmetric."

"Policy-makers were right not to be too slow to introduce emergency
measures, and they should now guard against being too quick to withdraw
them" said Gurría.
