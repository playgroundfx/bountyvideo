South Korea's unemployment rate rose to a ten-year high in May as firms
reduced hiring amid [coronavirus][1] pandemic, figures from Statistics
Korea showed on Wednesday.

The jobless rate rose to a seasonally adjusted 4.5 percent in May from
3.8 percent in April. In the same month last year, the unemployment rate
was 4.0 percent.

This was the highest rate in ten years.

On an unadjusted basis, the unemployment rate increased to 4.5 percent
from 4.2 percent in the previous month.

The number of unemployed decreased to 1.278 million in May from 1.172
million in the preceding month.

At the same time, the number of employed persons increased by 368,000
from prior month to 26.93 million in May.

The unemployment rate to 4.5 percent in May, but employment too
increased on a monthly basis, so if such a thing is possible, this is a
"good" rise in the unemployment rate, Robert Carnell, an ING economist
said.
