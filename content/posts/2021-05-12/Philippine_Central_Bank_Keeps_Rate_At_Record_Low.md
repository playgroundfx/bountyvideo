The Philippine central bank decided to keep its key interest rate at a
record low on Wednesday, after official data showed that the
[economy][1] continued to contract at the start of the year.

The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas decided to hold
the key interest rate, which is the overnight reverse repurchase
facility rate, steady at 2.00 percent.

The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were
kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.

"On balance, the expected path of inflation and downside risks to
domestic economic growth warrant keeping monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings
steady," the bank said in a statement.

Looking ahead, the central bank affirmed that maintaining an
accommodative stance should quicken the economy's transition toward a
sustainable recovery.

Data released on Tuesday showed that the economy contracted for the
fifth straight quarter in the three months to March period. Gross
domestic product fell 4.2 percent in the first quarter from the last
year, but slower than the 8.3 percent decline seen in the fourth quarter
of 2020.

The bank expects inflation to settle within the target range in 2021 and
2022. The BSP downgraded its inflation outlook for 2021 to 3.9 percent
from 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, the outlook for 2022 was raised to 3
percent from 2.8 percent.

The bank said sustained support for domestic demand remains a priority
for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), especially as risk aversion continues to hamper
credit activity despite ample liquidity in the financial system.

The main reason the central bank did not cut interest rates today is
elevated inflation, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics,
said. The economist expects inflation to fall back in the second half of
the year.
