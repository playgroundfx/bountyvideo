The Bank of Japan will on Thursday release the minutes from its monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on January 17 and 18, highlighting a busy day for Asia-
Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the BoJ voted 8-1 to maintain its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stimulus unchanged at -0.1 percent on current accounts that financial
institutions maintain at the central bank. It also lifted its inflation
forecast for the next fiscal year, citing a rise in commodity prices.

The bank also said it will continue to purchase a necessary amount of
Japanese government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year
JGB yields will remain at around zero percent.

Japan also will see March results for the manufacturing, services and
composite indexes from Jibun Bank; in February, their scores were 45.8,
52.7 and 44.2, respectively.

Australia will see March results for the manufacturing, services and
composite indexes from Markit Economics; in February, their scores were
57.0, 57.4 and 56.6, respectively.

The central bank in the Philippines will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
meeting and then announce its decision on interest rates; the bank is
expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 2.00 percent.

Taiwan will release unemployment data for February; in January, the
jobless rate was 3.70 percent.

Thailand will provide February data for imports, exports and trade
balance. Imports are predicted to rise 19.0 percent on year, slowing
from 20.5 percent in January. Exports are called higher by an annual
10.4 percent, up from 8.0 percent in the previous month. The trade
deficit is pegged at $1.5 billion following the $2.5 billion shortfall a
month earlier.
