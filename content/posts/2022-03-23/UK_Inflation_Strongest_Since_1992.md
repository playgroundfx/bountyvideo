UK consumer price inflation accelerated at the fastest pace since 1992
in February, largely driven by fuel prices, the Office for National
Statistics said on Wednesday.  
  
Consumer price inflation rose to 6.2 percent in February from 5.5
percent in January. The rate was forecast to rise moderately to 5.9
percent.

This was the highest inflation rate in the National Statistic series
which began in January 1997, and the highest rate in the historic
modeled series since March 1992, when it stood at 7.1 percent.

Inflation data adds to the pressure on the Chancellor to offset more of
the cost of living crisis in today's fiscal Spring Statement, Paul
Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

With inflation now more than three times the Bank of England's 2 percent
target, the Bank of England may reassess its dovish tone after it raised
interest rates to 0.75 percent last week, the economist said. The rates
are likely to rise to 2.00 percent next year.

Inflation is set to peak a little above 8 percent in April as higher
petrol prices combined with the dramatic increase in the electricity/gas
price cap, James Smith, an ING economist said. The situation later this
year looks less worrisome given the pullback in gas prices.

Data showed that core inflation that excludes energy, food, alcoholic
beverages and tobacco, advanced to 5.2 percent from 4.4 percent in the
previous month.  
  
The largest contributions to the inflation came from housing and
household services and transport. There were no large offsetting
downward contributions to change.

Month-on-month, the consumer price index rose 0.8 percent, in contrast
to the 0.1 percent fall in January. Monthly inflation was the fastest
seen between January and February since 2009.

Another report from the ONS showed that output price inflation increased
to 10.1 percent, in line with expectations and the fastest since
September 2008, from 9.9 percent in January.

On a monthly basis, output price inflation came in at 0.8 percent versus
1.2 percent in January. The expected rate was 0.9 percent.

Input price inflation advanced to 14.7 percent in February from 14.2
percent a month ago. Economists had forecast the rate to slow to 13.9
percent.

Month-on-month, input price growth eased slightly to 1.4 percent from
1.5 percent but remained above the economists' forecast of 1.2 percent.

In January, house price inflation eased to 9.6 percent in January from
10.0 percent in December, the ONS said in a separate communiqu√©.

The average UK house price was GBP 274,000 in January, which was GBP
24,000 higher than this time last year. London continued to be the
region with the lowest annual growth at 2.2 percent.
