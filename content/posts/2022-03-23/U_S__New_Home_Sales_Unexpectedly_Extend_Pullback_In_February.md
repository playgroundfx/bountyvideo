New home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly extended the previous month's
sharp pullback in the month of February, according to a report released
by the Commerce Department on Wednesday.

The report showed new home sales slumped by 2.0 percent to an annual
rate of 772,000 in February after plunging by 8.4 percent to a revised
rate of 788,000 in January.

The continued decrease surprised economists, who had expected new home
sales to jump by 1.1 percent to a rate of 810,000 from the 801,000
originally reported for the previous month.

With the unexpected drop, new home sales continued to give back ground
after reaching their highest annual rate since last March in December.

"We expect new home sales to lose more momentum as we move further into
2022," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

She added, "Demand may remain strong, but high home prices and the spike
in mortgage rates since the end of 2021 - the most rapid since 1994 -
will price some buyers out of the market."

New home sales in the West led the way lower in February, plummeting by
13.0 percent to an annual rate of 194,000, while new home sales in the
South slid by 1.7 percent to a rate of 451,000.

Meanwhile, the report showed new home sales in the Midwest surged by 6.3
percent to a rate of 84,000, and new home sales in the Northeast
skyrocketed by 59.3 percent to a rate of 43,000.

The Commerce Department also said the median sales price of new houses
sold in February was $400,600, down 6.3 percent from $427,400 in January
but up 10.7 percent from $362,000 a year ago.

The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale climbed to
407,000 in February from 398,000 in January, reaching the highest level
since August 2008.

The number of new homes for sale represents 6.3 months of supply at the
current sales rate, up from 6.1 months in January.

Last Friday, the National Association of Realtors released a separate
report showing a sharp pullback in U.S. existing home sales in the month
of February.

NAR said existing home sales plunged by 7.2 percent to an annual rate of
6.02 million in February after surging by 6.6 percent to a revised rate
of 6.49 million in January.

Economists had expected existing home sales to tumble by 6.2 percent to
a rate of 6.10 million from the 6.50 million originally reported for the
previous month.

The steeper than expected pullback came after existing home sales
reached their highest annual rate in a year in January.
