Consumer prices in New Zealand were up 0.7 percent on quarter in the
third quarter of 2020, Statistics New Zealand said on Friday.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 0.9 percent on quarter
following the 0.5 percent contraction in the three months prior.

Seasonally adjusted, inflation was up 0.3 percent on quarter.

On a yearly basis, consumer prices were up 1.4 percent - again missing
forecasts for a gain of 1.7 percent and slowing from 1.5 percent in the
previous three months.
