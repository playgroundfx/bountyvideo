French [business][1] confidence weakened in October, monthly survey data
from the statistical office Insee showed on Thursday.

The manufacturing confidence index fell unexpectedly to 93 in October
from September's revised score of 94. The expected reading was 96.0.

The indicator had been steadily recovering since May 2020 from its
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) fall caused by the [health][2] crisis. Nonetheless, the score
has remained well below its long-term level of 100.

The balance of opinion on personal production expectations worsened
again in October. The corresponding index slid to 4 from 10 a month ago.
Likewise, the indicator for general production expectations weakened to
-12 from -3.

The survey showed that managers' assessment on overall and foreign
order-books worsened a little with the indices easing to -36 and -45,
respectively. These two balances of opinion were markedly below their
pre-crisis level.

Only the assessment of production over the last three months has
positively contributed to the business climate. In October, the index
advanced to 15, the highest since August 2018, from 7 in September.

Overall business confidence weakened in October driven by services and
manufacturing. The business sentiment index came in at 90, down from 92
in September.

Elsewhere, a quarterly survey from Insee showed that both total and
foreign demand over the last three months sharply picked up signaling
that activity restarted after the lockdown.

However, demand prospects, both overall and abroad, have fallen back
after a rebound in July.

Data showed that production capacity utilization rate in industry has
continued to pick up. The indicator gained 3 points to 78 percent in
October.
