Danish consumers were less pessimistic in October as the assessment
regarding their personal financial situation improved leading to an
increase in the willingness to buy, despite fears of rising unemployment
in future, survey data from Statistics Denmark showed on Thursday.

The consumer confidence indicator rose to -6.2 from -7.4 in September.
The reading was at -5.5 in August.

The score also remained below the six-month average of -5.7.

"The modest increase in consumer confidence is primarily due to a marked
increase in the desire to buy after the frozen holiday pay began to be
released," the statistical office said.

The improvement was offset by a sharp fall in consumers' expectations
regarding Denmark's [economy][1] in a year's time.
