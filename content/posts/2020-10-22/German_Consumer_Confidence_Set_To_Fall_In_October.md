German consumer confidence is set to weaken in November, survey data
from the market research group Gfk showed on Thursday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index fell more-than-expected to
-3.1 from -1.7 in October. The index was forecast to drop to -2.8.

All three sub components, namely economic and income expectations and
the propensity to buy declined in October.

After five rises in a row, the economic sentiment decreased seventeen
points to 7.1 points in October. Consumers assumed that the much more
active infection process in Germany will slow down the previously hoped
for rapid recovery of the largest euro area [economy][1].

Dwindling economic optimism affected consumer income prospects in
October. The income expectation indicator slid 6.3 points to 9.8 in
October.

In the wake of falling income prospects, the propensity to buy also
accepted losses. With a fall of 1.4 points, the indicator reached 37.0
points in October.
