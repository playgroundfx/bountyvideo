A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a decrease
in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week ended
October 17th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 787,000, a
decrease of 55,000 from the previous week's revised level of 842,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to drop to 860,000 from the
898,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Along with the notable downward revision to the previous week's number,
the report showed initial jobless claims in the week ended October 3rd
were downwardly revised to 767,000 from 845,000.

The Labor Department noted the latest release reflects actual counts for
California, which has completed its pause in processing of initial
claims and resumed reporting actual unemployment insurance claims data.

The report said the less volatile four-week moving average dipped to
811,250, a decrease of 21,500 from the previous week's revised average
of 832,750.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 1.024 million to 8.373 million
in the week ended October 10th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims plunged to 10,085,750,
a decrease of 1,093,500 from the previous week's revised average of
11,179,250.

"Continuing claims fell by more than 1 million, but that positive trend
is partly offset by a rise in the number of individuals who have
exhausted regular benefits, which totaled more than 3.7 million in the
week ended October 3," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

She added, "Failure to pass additional fiscal relief measures that
include emergency unemployment benefits poses considerable downside risk
to the [economy][1], particularly with Covid-19 cases on the rise,
raising the possibility of new restrictions."
