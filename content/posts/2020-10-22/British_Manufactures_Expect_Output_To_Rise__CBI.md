UK manufacturers expect production to grow at a moderate pace and orders
to remain unchanged over the coming quarter, according to the quarterly
Industrial Trends Survey data released by the Confederation of British
Industry.

In the quarter to October, output volumes rose to -8 percent from -20
percent in September. A net 15 percent expect output to grow in the next
quarter.

The total order book balance came in at +3 percent, after falling
sharply to -60 percent in July. Overall orders are forecast to remain
unchanged in the coming quarter.

In October, the order book balance rose to -34 percent from -48 percent
a month ago. The expected level was -45 percent.

The numbers employed in the three months to October fell at a slower
pace than in July. A net 27 percent said employment declined in three
months to October. Firms expect headcounts to be broadly flat next
quarter.

"Manufacturers will also be closely observing progress with Brexit
negotiations as the deadline for a deal approaches," Tom Crotty, Group
Director at INEOS and chair of the CBI Manufacturing Council, said.

"Manufacturing jobs, businesses and livelihoods are very much at stake
and it is essential that leaders find a way through the current impasse
and secure a deal," Crotty added.
