Turkey's central bank maintained its key rates on Thursday after hiking
it by 200 basis points last month.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, led by Governor Murat Uysal, decided to hold the one-week repo
auction rate, at 10.25 percent.  
  
In September, the bank had raised the rate from 8.25 percent, which was
the first increase in two years.

The bank decided to adjust the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) operational framework and
set the margin between the CBRT Late Liquidity Window lending rate and
overnight lending rate as 300 basis points.

The bank said it will continue enhancing flexibility in liquidity
management and with liquidity measures until inflation outlook displays
a significant improvement.

The committee assessed that restoring the disinflation process is a key
factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest
rates, and stronger economic recovery.
