Reflecting record-low interest rates and an abundance of buyers, the
National Association of Realtors released a report on Thursday showing a
much bigger than expected spike in U.S. existing home sales in the month
of September.

NAR said existing home sales soared by 9.4 percent to an annual rate of
6.54 million in September after jumping by 2 percent to a revised rate
of 5.98 million in August.

Economists had expected existing home sales to surge up by 5.0 percent
to a rate of 6.30 million from the 6.00 million originally reported for
the previous month.

"Home sales traditionally taper off toward the end of the year, but in
September they surged beyond what we normally see during this season,"
said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.

He added, "I would attribute this jump to record-low interest rates and
an abundance of buyers in the marketplace, including buyers of vacation
homes given the greater flexibility to work from home."

The report said the median existing home price for all housing types was
$311,800, in September, up 0.5 percent from $310.400 in August and up
14.8 percent from $271,500 a year ago.

Housing inventory at the end of September totaled 1.47 million units,
down 1.3 percent from August and down 19.2 percent from September of
2019.

The unsold inventory represents 2.7 months of supply at the current
sales pace, down from 3.0 months in August and down from 4.0 months a
year ago.

"There is no shortage of hopeful, potential buyers, but inventory is
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low," Yun said. "To their credit, we have seen some
homebuilders move to ramp up supply, but a need for even more production
still exists."

NAR also said single-family home sales spiked by 9.7 percent to a rate
of 5.87 million in September, while existing condominium and co-op sales
jumped by 6.3 percent to a rate of 670,000.

Next Monday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report
on new home sales in the month of September.
