The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in October,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Friday with a manufacturing PMI score of 54.2.

That's down from 55.4 in September, although it remains above the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Services activity rose solidly in October, building on a mild gain in
September. Inflows of new work also increased further, though at a pace
insufficient to put pressure on capacity in the service sector. Firms
consequently reduced their workforces further, but at a rate noticeably
slower than in September.

The survey also said the services PMI rose to 53.8 from 50.8 last month
and the composite PMI came in at 53.6 - up from 51.1.

Growth in [business][1] activity across the Australian private sector
gained pace in October as restrictions designed to contain the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were relaxed further. The rate of
increase was solid and the fastest for three months.
