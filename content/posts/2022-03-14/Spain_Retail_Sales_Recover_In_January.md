Spain retail sales recovered in January, underpinned by non-food
turnover, the statistical office INE said on Monday.

Retail sales climbed 4.0 percent on a yearly basis, in contrast to the
2.4 percent fall in December.

Likewise, on an unadjusted basis, retail sales were up 3.8 percent,
reversing a 3.1 percent decrease a month ago.

Excluding service stations, retail sales were up 3.2 percent annually,
data showed.

Food sales decreased 0.7 percent, while non-food product sales advanced
6.3 percent in January.

On a monthly basis, retail sales were down 0.3 percent, but slower than
the 6.1 percent decline in December. This was the second consecutive
fall in sales.
