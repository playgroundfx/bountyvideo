from 8.4 percent in January. Economists had expected an inflation of 9.0
percent.

Non-food prices grew 9.3 percent and food prices rose 8.8 percent
annually in February. Services prices increased 6.1 percent.

On a monthly basis, the consumer price index rose 0.6 percent in
February.

The EU measure of harmonized index, or HICP rose 7.9 percent yearly in
February, following a 7.2 percent gain in the previous month.

On a month-on-month basis, the HICP rose 1.0 percent in February.
