The Bank of England hinted at "modest tightening" in a three-year
horizon as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers expect inflation to temporarily reach 4 percent.
The bank kept its key interest rate and quantitative easing unchanged on
Thursday.

The central bank cautioned that the [economy][1] is set to undergo a
"more pronounced" period of above-target inflation in the near-term than
previously projected, before returning close to the 2 percent over the
medium-term.

The Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-0 to leave the key interest rate
unchanged at a historic low of 0.10 percent.

The central bank also retained the existing stock of corporate bond
purchases at GBP 20 billion and the government bond purchases at GBP 875
billion, taking the size of total quantitative easing to GBP 895
billion.

The MPC voted unanimously to retain corporate bond purchases, while
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker Michael Saunders sought to reduce government bond purchases
by GBP 45 billion to GBP 830 billion.

Michael Saunders observed at the latest MPC meeting that the economic
outlook warranted a reduction in the scale of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus.
The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker said inflation was likely to remain above the 2 percent
target two and three years ahead with the existing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance.

The MPC judged that some modest tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) over the
forecast period was likely to be necessary to meet the inflation target
sustainably in the medium term, the bank said in its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
summary.

The first rate hike is likely to come in early 2023, or perhaps a little
earlier, ING economist James Smith said.

While the bank is starting to signal that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be tightened, it
is not suggesting it's going to be tightened soon, Ruth Gregory, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

"What's more, we think inflation will be a bit lower next year than the
Bank expects, which suggests [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) won't be tightened until mid-2023,
rather than the mid-2022 date priced into the [markets][2]," Gregory
added.

The bank indicated that it intends to reduce its stock of assets
purchased by not reinvesting maturing assets once the bank rate has
risen to 0.50 percent.

According to the Monetary Policy Report, inflation is likely to rise
temporarily to 4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year. This was
1.5 percentage points higher than estimated in May.

Nonetheless, inflation will fall back and return close to the 2 percent
target in the medium term, the bank noted.

The UK economy was expected to have grown by 5 percent in the second
quarter of 2021, leaving it around 4 percent below its pre-pandemic
level and slightly stronger than expected in the May Report.

GDP was projected to grow around 3 percent in the third quarter of 2021,
somewhat weaker than expected in May. Thereafter, the economy is
forecast to recover further, reaching its pre-pandemic level in the
fourth quarter of 2021.
