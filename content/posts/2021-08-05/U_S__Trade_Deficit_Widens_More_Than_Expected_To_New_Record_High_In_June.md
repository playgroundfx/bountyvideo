The U.S. trade deficit widened by more than expected in the month of
June, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Thursday.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to a new record
high of $75.7 billion in June from a revised $71.0 billion in May.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to $74.1 billion from
the $71.2 billion originally reported for the previous month.

"Robust economic growth in the US and still-struggling demand from
abroad drove a widening of the trade deficit for a second consecutive
month in June," said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

The wider than expected trade deficit reflected a sharp increase in the
value of imports, which surged up by 2.1 percent to $283.4 billion in
June after jumping by 1.3 percent to $277.5 billion in May.

A substantial increase in imports of industrial supplies and materials
more than offset by a decrease in imports of consumer goods.

Meanwhile, the report showed the value of exports rose by 0.6 percent to
$207.7 billion in June after climbing by 0.9 percent to $206.5 billion
in May.

A notable increase in the value of crude oil exports was largely offset
by a drop in exports of foods, feeds, and beverages.

The Commerce Department also said the goods deficit widened to $93.2
billion in June from $89.1 billion in May, while the services surplus
narrowed to $17.4 billion from $18.1 billion.

"Looking ahead, we expect the deficit will start to narrow as trade
flows rotate away from imports and towards exports as domestic
consumption slows and growth abroad accelerates," said Rasheed.

He added, "However, deteriorating [health][1] conditions could distort
trade further if virus restrictions are reimposed and recoveries stall."
