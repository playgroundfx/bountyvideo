Ireland's jobless rate increased in July, figures from the Central
Statistics Office showed on Thursday.

The seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 7.4 percent in July from
6.8 percent in June. In the same month last year, the unemployment rate
was 6.7 percent.

The Covid-19 crisis has continued to have a significant impact on the
labor market in June, the agency said.

The seasonally adjusted number of unemployed fell to 195,700 persons in
July from 170,400 in the preceding month.

The youth unemployment rate, which applies to the 15-24 age group,
increased to 20.3 percent in July from 18.3 percent in the prior month.
