The average of household spending in Japan was down 5.1 percent on year
in June, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Friday - coming in at 260,285 yen.

That was well shy of expectations for an increase of 0.1 percent and
down sharply from the 11.6 percent spike in May.

On a monthly basis, household spending sank 3.2 percent - again missing
forecasts for an increase of 2.0 percent after slipping 2.1 percent in
the previous month.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 904,078 yen, down
11.5 percent on year.
