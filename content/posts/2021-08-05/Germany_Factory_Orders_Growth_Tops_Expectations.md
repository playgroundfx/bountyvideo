Germany factory orders grew more than expected in June, underpinned by

3.2 percent fall in May.

higher than in the previous month.

Domestic orders advanced 9.6 percent, while foreign orders went up only
0.4 percent in June.

On a yearly basis, manufacturing orders advanced sharply by 26.2
percent, but down from 54.9 percent in May.

Data showed that manufacturing turnover dropped 1.4 percent on month in
June, following a 0.4 percent fall in May.
