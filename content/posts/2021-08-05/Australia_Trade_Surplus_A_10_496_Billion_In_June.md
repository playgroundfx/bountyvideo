June, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.

That exceeded expectations for a surplus of A$10.45 billion following
the downwardly revised A$9.269 billion surplus in the previous month
(originally A$9.681 billion).

Exports were up A$1.489 billion or 4.0 percent on month to A$43.337
billion following the 6.0 percent increase in May.

Imports climbed A$261 million or 1.0 percent on month to A$32.840
billion following the 3.0 percent gain a month earlier.
