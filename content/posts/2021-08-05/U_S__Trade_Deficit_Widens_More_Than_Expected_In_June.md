The U.S. trade deficit widened by more than expected in the month of
June, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Thursday.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $75.7 billion
in June from a revised $71.0 billion in May.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to $74.1 billion from
the $71.2 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider than expected trade deficit came as the value of imports
jumped by 2.1 percent to $283.4 billion, while the value of exports rose
by 0.6 percent to $207.7 billion.
