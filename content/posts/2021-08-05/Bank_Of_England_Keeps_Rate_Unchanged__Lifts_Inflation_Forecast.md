The Bank of England retained its interest rate and quantitative easing
unchanged and raised its inflation outlook citing higher energy prices.

The Monetary Policy Committee unanimously decided to leave the key
interest rate unchanged at 0.10 percent.

The central bank retained the existing stock of corporate bond purchases
at GBP 20 billion and the government bond purchases at GBP 875 billion,
taking the size of total quantitative easing to GBP 895 billion.

The MPC voted unanimously to retain corporate bond purchases, while one
member sought to reduce government bond purchases by GBP 45 billion to
GBP 830 billion.

Michael Saunders observed that with the existing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance,
inflation was likely to remain above the 2 percent target two and three
years ahead and the economic outlook warranted a reduction in the scale
of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus at this MPC meeting.

The committee judged that, should the [economy][1] evolve broadly in
line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report,
some modest tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) over the forecast period was
likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation
target sustainably in the medium term, the bank said in its monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) summary.

According to the Monetary Policy Report, inflation is likely to rise
temporarily in the near term, to 4 percent in the fourth quarter of
2021, 1.5 percentage points higher than had been expected in the May
Report.

Inflation was expected to fall back and was projected to return to close
to the 2 percent target in the medium term.

The economy was expected to have risen by 5 percent in the second
quarter of 2021, leaving it around 4 percent below its pre-pandemic
level and slightly stronger than expected in the May Report.

GDP was projected to expand around 3 percent in the third quarter of
2021, somewhat weaker than expected in the May Report. Thereafter, the
economy was set to recover further, reaching its pre-pandemic level in
the fourth quarter of 2021.
