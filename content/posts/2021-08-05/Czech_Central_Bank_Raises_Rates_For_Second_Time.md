The Czech central bank raised its key interest rate on Thursday for a
second [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session in a row.  
  
The Bank Board decided to raise the the two-week repo rate by 25Â basis
points to 0.75 percent, the Czech National Bank said in a statement.
That was in line with economists' expectations.  
  
The Lombard rate was raised by 50 basis points to 1.75 percent, while
the discount rate was left unchanged at 0.05 percent.

On June 23, the bank raised its key interest rate for the first time in
one-and-a-half years. The board had increased the two-week repo rate by
25 basis points to 0.50 percent.  
  
Four [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers voted in favor of the latest hike decision. One member
voted for increasing the two-week repo rate by 50 basis points, while
two rate-setters voted for leaving rates unchanged.  
  
The bank said [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers decided to raise the key rate further
supported by the latest macroeconomic forecast, consistent with which
there was a rise in market interest rates from the middle of this year
onwards.  
  
"A monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response is needed in view of the robust price
pressures from the domestic [economy][1] and abroad."

"At this stage, a gradual tightening of monetary conditions will not
jeopardise the recovery of the Czech economy from the pandemic and will
reinforce the confidence of Czech economic agents in long-term price
stability in our country," the bank said.
