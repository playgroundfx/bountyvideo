France industrial production recovered in June, data from the
statistical office Insee showed on Thursday.

Industrial production grew 0.5 percent in June from May, when output was
down 0.4 percent. Economists had forecast output to climb 0.6 percent.

Likewise, manufacturing output advanced 0.9 percent, offsetting May's
0.6 percent decrease.

Compared to February 2020, the last month before the first general
lockdown, manufacturing output decreased 6.2 percent, and output in
whole industry was down 5.3 percent.

Data showed that mining and quarrying output fell 1.8 percent and
construction output declined 2 percent from May.
