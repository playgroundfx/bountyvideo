A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the U.S.
trade deficit was nearly unchanged in February, as imports and exports
both increased.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed by less than
$0.1 billion to $89.2 billion in February. Economists had expected the
deficit to narrow to $88.5 billion from the $89.7 billion originally
reported for the previous month.

The trade deficit was little changed as the value of imports jumped by
$4.1 billion or 1.3 percent to $317.8 billion, while the value of
exports surged by $4.1 billion or 1.8 percent to $228.6 billion.

The increase in the value of imports was largely due to a spike in the
value of imports of industrial supplies and materials, particularly
crude oil, which helped offset a steep drop in imports passenger cars.

Meanwhile, notable increases in the value of exports of drugs and
industrial supplies and materials contributed to the advance in the
value of exports.

The report also showed the goods trade deficit narrowed to $107.5
billion in February from $108.6 billion in January, while the services
trade surplus shrank to $18.3 billion from $19.4 billion.

"The February data failed to fully capture the downstream impact of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on trade flows, which will unfold slowly in
the coming months and potentially longer if the war persists," said
Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

"Given our broad-based downward revisions to global growth in 2022 and
2023, we believe geopolitical headwinds will squeeze demand for U.S.
exports this year," he added. "Conversely, imports should remain on a
steady footing, though growth is expected to moderate."
