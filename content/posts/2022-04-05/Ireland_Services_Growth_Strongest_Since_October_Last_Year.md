Ireland's service sector growth improved to the strongest level since
October last year as [markets][1] continued to reopen, survey data from
IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The AIB Ireland services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 63.4 in
March from 61.8 in February. Any reading above 50.0 indicates expansion
in the sector.

"The AIB Irish Services PMI showed very strong growth in the sector in
March as the recovery in services activity continued to gain momentum
following the lifting of COVID restrictions earlier in the year," Oliver
Mangan, AIB chief economist, said.

New [business][2] expanded sharply further in March, led by stronger
activity growth. Outstanding business increased at the fastest rate
since October 2000.

The overall sentiment remained positive in March, but was the least
since the beginning of 2021.

Input price inflation accelerated to the highest level on record and
charged prices increased in March.

Employment increased at the fastest rate in seven months in March.

The composite output index, covering manufacturing and services, rose to
61.0 in March from 59.1 in February. This was the fastest growth since
October last year.
