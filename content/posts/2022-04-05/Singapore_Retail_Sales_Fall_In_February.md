Singapore's retail sales declined in February, partly due to lower sale
in the same month last year when sales were boosted by the pre-Chinese
New Year spending, data from the Department of Statistics showed on
Tuesday.

percent increase in January. This year, pre-Chinese new year spending

and those of mini-marts and convenience store fell 14.1 percent.

Sales of supermarkets and hypermarkets and department stores fell by

others decreased 8.3 percent.

percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.
