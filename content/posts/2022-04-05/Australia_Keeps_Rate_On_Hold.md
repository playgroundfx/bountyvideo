Australia's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at a
record low, as widely expected, on Tuesday.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to maintain its cash rate target at 0.10 percent.

Inflation has picked up and a further increase is expected, but growth
in labor costs has been below rates that are likely to be consistent
with inflation being sustainably at target, the bank noted.

Over coming months, important additional evidence will be available to
the Board on both inflation and the evolution of labour costs, Lowe
said.

The Board will assess this and other incoming information as its sets
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to support full employment in Australia and inflation outcomes
consistent with the target.
