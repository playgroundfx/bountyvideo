After reporting a slowdown in the pace of growth in U.S. service sector
activity over the past few months, the Institute for Supply Management
released a report on Tuesday showing growth in the sector reaccelerated
in the month of March.

The ISM said its services PMI rose to 58.3 in March from 56.5 in
February, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the sector.
Economists had expected the index to rebound to 58.0.

The slightly bigger than expected increase by the services PMI follows
three consecutive monthly decreases after the index reached a record
high in November.

The rebound by the headline index came as the new orders index jumped to
60.1 in March from 56.1 in February. The [business][1] activity index
also crept up to 55.5 from 55.1.

The report showed the employment index also rebounded to 54.0 in March
from 48.5 in February, indicating job growth in the service sector
following a contraction in the previous month.

The inventories index also inched up to 51.7 in March from 50.8 in
February, while the supplier deliveries index fell to 63.4 from 66.2.

On the inflation front, the prices index edged up to 83.8 in March from
83.1 in February, reaching its second-highest reading ever behind
December's 83.9.

"There was an uptick in business activity in March, but respondents have
indicated that they continue to be impacted by capacity constraints,
logistical challenges and inflation," said Anthony Nieves, Chair of the
ISM Services Business Survey Committee.

"Labor shortages have eased slightly, as COVID-19 cases have declined
and public-[health][2] restrictions have been relaxed," he added.
"Geopolitical concerns — particularly the Russia/Ukraine war, which has
impacted material costs, most notably fuel and chemical prices — have
created uncertainty for many businesses."

The ISM released a separate last Friday showing manufacturing activity
in the U.S. unexpectedly grew at a modestly slower rate in the month of
March.

The manufacturing PMI dipped to 57.1 in March from 58.6 in February,
while economists had expected the index to inch up to 59.0.
