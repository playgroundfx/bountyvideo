The Czech retail sales grew at a softer pace in February after
accelerating in the previous month, data from the Czech Statistical
Office showed on Tuesday.

Retail sales rose a working-day 4.6 percent year-on-year in February,
after a 9.4 percent growth in January. In December, retail sales rose
0.1 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, retail sales excluding automobile trade
remained unchanged in February.

Sales of non-food gained 1.0 percent, while those of food goods declined
2.2 percent. Sales of automotive fuel increased 1.9 percent.

"In February, the retail sales growth was contributed to by a low
comparison basis influenced by measures due to the corona-virus
pandemic," Jana Gotvaldova, head of the Trade, Transport, and Services
Statistics unit, said.

Sales of clothing, footwear and leather goods grew by 119.3 percent and
those of culture and recreation goods gained 34.6 percent. Sales of
other household equipment and information and communication rose by 17.3
percent and 11.3 percent, respectively.
