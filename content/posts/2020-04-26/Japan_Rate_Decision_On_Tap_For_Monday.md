The Bank of Japan will warp up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Monday and
then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a light day
for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

The central bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark lending rate
unchanged at -0.10 percent, although it may introduce other means of
stimulus to combat the economic woes brought about by the Covid-19
pandemic.

China will see March figures for industrial profits; in February,
profits plummeted 38.3 percent on year.

Hong Kong will release March numbers for imports, exports and trade
balance. In February, imports were worth 277.11 billion HKD and exports
were at 238.56 billion HKD for a trade deficit of 38.55 billion HKD.

Finally, the [markets][1] in New Zealand are closed on Monday for ANZAC
Day and will reopen on Tuesday.
