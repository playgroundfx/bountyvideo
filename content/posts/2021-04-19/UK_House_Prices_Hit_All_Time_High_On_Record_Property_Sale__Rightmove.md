UK house prices reached a record high in April as properties available
to buy hit the lowest proportion ever recorded due to high demand,
property [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove said Monday.

House prices increased 2.1 percent on a monthly basis in April,
following a 0.8 percent rise in March. Average house prices hit a record
GBP 327,797.

Year-on-year, house price inflation accelerated to 5.1 percent in April
from 2.7 percent in the previous month.

The agency said the average number of days to sell a property reached
its lowest ever level, and the number of houses selling within a week
reached its highest ever level.

About 145,000 properties were newly marketed in April, but not enough to
meet buyer demand.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove's Director of Property Data said, "This is only
the second time over the past five years that prices have increased by
over 2 percent in a month, so it's a big jump, especially bearing in
mind that the lockdown restrictions are still limiting the population's
movements and activities."

However, Bannister said some of the froth is likely to come off this
spring surge later in the year as the challenging economic conditions
come to the fore, some of the Government support to individuals and
businesses unwinds, and the stamp duty holidays finally end in England
and Wales. Nevertheless, activity is expected to remain robust for the
rest of 2021.
