The euro area current account surplus declined in February largely due
to a fall in the goods trade surplus, data published by the European
Central Bank showed on Monday.

The current account surplus totaled EUR 26 billion versus a EUR 35
billion surplus in January.

The surplus on goods trade fell to EUR 32 billion from EUR 38 billion
and that on services trade decreased to EUR 11 billion from EUR 12
billion in the previous month.

Primary income showed a shortfall of EUR 2 billion versus -EUR 1 billion
in January. Likewise, the shortfall on secondary income widened to EUR
16 billion from EUR 15 billion.

In twelve months to February, the current account surplus came in at EUR
259 billion, or 2.3 percent of euro area GDP, down from EUR 263 billion
or 2.2 percent a year earlier.
