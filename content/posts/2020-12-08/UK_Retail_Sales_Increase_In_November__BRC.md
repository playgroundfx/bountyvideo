UK retail sales increased in November despite the national lockdown, the
British Retail Consortium reported Tuesday.

Like-for-like retail sales grew 7.7 percent on a yearly basis in
November driven by food and grocery sales.

Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said the disparity between
online and in-store non-food sales widened, with the highest online
penetration rate since May.

"Despite the on-going unprecedented environment, UK retail fought hard
during November to win growth on last year," Paul Martin, UK head of
retail, KPMG, said.  
  
"It was a tale of two channels however, as lockdown resulted in a dismal
performance for high street retailers, whilst online sales rose by
impressive double figures across most categories," Martin added.
