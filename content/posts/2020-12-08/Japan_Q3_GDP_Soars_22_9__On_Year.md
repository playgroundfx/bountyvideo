Japan's gross domestic product surged an annualized 22.9 percent in the
third quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.

That beat expectations for an increase of 21.5 percent following the
28.8 percent plunge in the previous three months.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was up 5.0 percent - matching forecasts
following the 8.2 percent decline in the three months prior.

Capital expenditure was down 2.4 percent on quarter, exceeding
expectations for a decline of 3.2 percent following the 4.5 percent fall
in the second quarter.

External demand was up 2.7 percent on quarter, shy of expectations for
an increase of 2.9 percent following the 3.3 percent contraction in Q2.

The price index was up 1.2 percent on year, matching expectations
following the 1.4 percent increase in the second quarter.

Private consumption was up 5.1 percent on quarter, beating forecasts for
4.7 percent after sinking 8.1 percent in the previous three months.

Also on Tuesday:  
• The average of household spending in Japan was up 1.9 percent on year

The average of monthly income per household stood at 546,786 yen, up 2.5
percent on year.

• Japan had a current account surplus of 2,144.7 billion yen in October,
