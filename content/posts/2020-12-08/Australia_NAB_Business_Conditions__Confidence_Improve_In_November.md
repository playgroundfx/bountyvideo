Australian [business][1] conditions and confidence improved in November
suggesting a rapid rebound in the economy as restrictions were eased and
state borders opened up, survey data from the National Bank of Australia
showed Tuesday.

The business conditions index climbed to 9 in November from 2 in
October. Likewise, the business sentiment indicator advanced to 12 from
3 a month ago.

Both confidence and conditions were above average, and stronger than the
period right before the pandemic - albeit this partly reflects some
"snapback" following the containment of the virus, NAB said.

While renewed optimism in Victoria drove the improvement in confidence,
Victoria was one of only two states to report deterioration in
conditions, although conditions are expected to improve as the impact of
its recent severe lockdown wears off, the agency said.

"Businesses appetite to hire worker and undertake new investments will
be crucial to the [economy][2]'s recovery going forward, as the initial
bounce in activity - and any pent-up demand - fades" Alan Oster, NAB
Group chief economist said.
