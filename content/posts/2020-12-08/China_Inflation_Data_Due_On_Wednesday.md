China will on Wednesday release November numbers for consumer and
producer prices, setting the pace for a modest day in Asia-Pacific
economic activity.

Consumer prices are predicted to have fallen 0.2 percent on month and be
flat on year after easing 0.3 percent on month and rising 0.5 percent in
October. Producer prices are called lower by 1.8 percent on year after
sinking 2.1 percent in the previous month.

Indonesia will see October numbers for retail sales; in September, sales
were down 8.7 percent on year.

Japan will provide October figures for core machine orders, with
forecasts suggesting an increase of 2.8 percent on month and a fall of
11.3 percent on year. That follows the 4.4 monthly decline and the 11.5
percent yearly drop in September.

Australia will see December results for the consumer confidence index
from Westpac Bank; in November, the index added 2.5 percent to a score
of 107.7.

New Zealand will release Q3 data for manufacturing sales; in the three
months prior, sales fell 12.1 percent on year.
