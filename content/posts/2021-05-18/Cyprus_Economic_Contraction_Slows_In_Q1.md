Cyprus' economic contraction slowed in the first three months of the
year, but the [economy][1] remained in recession, as activity picked up
amid an easing in restrictions linked to the coronavirus pandemic,
preliminary data from the statistical office showed Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product decreased a non-adjusted 1.6 percent year-on-year
following a 4.5 percent slump in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the same
period last year, the economy grew 1.0 percent.  
  
On a seasonally and working-day adjusted basis, GDP fell 1.6 percent
year-on-year after a 4.4 percent decline in the previous quarter.  
  
Economic output has been falling in annual comparison since the second
quarter of 2020 when the [coronavirus][2] started impacting activity
across the world.  
  
Compared to the previous quarter, GDP grew a seasonally and working-day
adjusted 2.0 percent in the first quarter following a 1.1 percent
increase in the previous three months.  
  
The statistical office attributed the negative GDP growth to weak
performance in the hospitality sector, manufacturing, transport, storage
and communication, wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles,
arts, [entertainment][3] and recreation, and other service activities.
