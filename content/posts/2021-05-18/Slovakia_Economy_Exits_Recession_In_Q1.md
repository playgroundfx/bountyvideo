Slovakia's [economy][1] exited a severe recession in the first quarter
of the year, preliminary estimates from the Statistical Office of the
Slovak Republic showed Tuesday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew a non-adjusted 0.3 percent year-on-year
following a 2.1 percent contraction in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
  
On a seasonally adjusted basis, GDP rose 0.5 percent in the first
quarter after a 2.3 percent decline in the previous three months.  
  
Compared to the same quarter last year, GDP fell a seasonally adjusted
1.8 percent after a 0.8 percent growth in the previous quarter.

An increase in activity in industry, especially in the automobile
sector, contributed to growth in the first quarter. External demand for
cars and related products led to a significantly positive balance of the
foreign trade that substantially contributed to gradual return to
normal.  
  
Meanwhile, domestic demand dampened growth due mainly to weaker final
household consumption amid pandemic measures and increased caution of
households related to their expenditures.
