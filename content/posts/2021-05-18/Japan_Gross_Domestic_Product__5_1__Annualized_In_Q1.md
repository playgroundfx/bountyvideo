Japan's gross domestic product contracted an annualized 5.1 percent in
the first quarter of 2021, the Cabinet Office said in Tuesday's
preliminary report.

That missed expectations for a decline of 4.6 percent following the
downwardly revised 11.6 percent increase in the previous three months
(originally 11.7 percent).

On a quarterly basis, GDP sank 1.3 percent - again missing expectations
for a drop of 1.2 percent following the 2.8 percent increase in the
three months prior.

Capital expenditure was down 1.4 percent on quarter, shy of expectations
for a gain of 1.1 percent following the 4.3 percent jump in the previous
quarter.
