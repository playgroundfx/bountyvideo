The goods account surplus widened to $5.73 billion, compared to $2.07
billion in January 2020.

The services account deficit decreased to $0.61 billion, from $2.99
billion in January 2020, owing to an improvement in the transport and
travel accounts.

The primary income account surplus increased from $1.63 billion the year
previously to $2.36 billion in January 2021, in line with an increase in
the income on equity.
