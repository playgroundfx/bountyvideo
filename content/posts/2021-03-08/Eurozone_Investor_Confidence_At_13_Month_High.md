Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence improved to the highest level in more than
a year in March as lockdowns had little negative impact, survey data
from Sentix showed on Monday.

The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index advanced to +5.0 in March from -0.2 in
February. This was the highest score since February 2020 and above
economists' forecast of 1.9.

The think tank said the data suggests that the euro area economic
recovery is continuing.

The current conditions index came in at a one-year high of -19.3, versus
-27.5 in the previous month. At the same time, the expectations
indicator rose moderately to 32.5 from 31.5 a month ago.

On a positive note, the [coronavirus][1] pandemic seems to have peaked
at the global level and vaccination is also progressing well in that the
number of immunized individuals is increasing and statistics suggest
that effective vaccination protection is being achieved, Sentix said.
These trends allow for a faster opening of the [economy][2].

In Germany, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence reached its highest level since November
2018. The sentiment index rose to 11.9 in March from 8.6 a month ago.

The current conditions index improved to -9.5 from -15.5, while the
expectations indicator held steady at 35.8. The survey was conducted
among 1,218 [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s between March 4 and 6.

The global [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index rose to a three-year high of 20.5 in
March from 17.5 in February.
