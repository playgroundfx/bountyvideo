The average of household spending in Japan was down 6.1 percent on year
in January, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Tuesday - coming in at 267,760 yen.

That missed expectations for a decline of 2.1 percent on year following
the 0.6 percent contraction in December.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 469,254 yen, down
2.5 percent on year.

Individually, spending was down for food, housing, clothing, medical
care, transportation and recreation. It was higher for fuel, furniture
and education.
