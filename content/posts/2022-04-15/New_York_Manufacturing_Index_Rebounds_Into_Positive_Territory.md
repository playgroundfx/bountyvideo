After reporting an unexpected contraction in New York manufacturing
activity in the previous month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
released a report on Friday showing a substantial rebound in activity in
the month of April.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index soared
to a positive 24.6 in April after tumbling to a negative 11.8 in March.
A positive reading indicates an expansion in regional manufacturing
activity.

Economists had expected the general business conditions index to show a
much more modest rebound to a positive 0.5.
