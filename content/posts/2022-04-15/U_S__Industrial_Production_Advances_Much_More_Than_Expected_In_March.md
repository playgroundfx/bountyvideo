Partly reflecting a spike in the output of motor vehicles and parts, the
Federal Reserve released a report on Friday showing U.S. industrial
production increased by much more than expected in the month of March.

The report showed industrial production advanced by 0.9 percent in
March, matching the upwardly revised increase in February.

Economists had expected industrial production to rise by 0.4 percent
compared to the 0.5 percent growth originally reported for the previous
month.

Manufacturing output climbed by 0.9 percent in March after jumping 1.2
percent in February, largely reflecting a 7.8 percent surge in the
output of motor vehicles and parts. Factory output elsewhere moved up
0.4 percent.

"The U.S. will not be immune to the global slowdown in manufacturing
underway led by China but, for now at least, easing supply constraints
are keeping growth in the factory sector strong," said Michael Pearce,
Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

The Fed said mining output also shot up by 1.7 percent in March after
surging by 1.3 percent in February, while utilities output rose by 0.4
percent after slumping by 1.0 percent in the previous month.

The report also showed capacity utilization in the industrial sector
increased to 78.3 percent in March from an upwardly revised 77.7 percent
in February.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to inch up to 77.8 percent
from the 77.6 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and mining sectors climbed to
78.7 percent and 79.6 percent, respectively, while capacity utilization
in the utilities sector crept up to 75.1 percent.
