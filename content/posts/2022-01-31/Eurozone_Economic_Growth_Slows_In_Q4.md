The euro area [economy][1] grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter
due to the restrictions imposed by the member countries amid the spread
of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, preliminary flash estimate
from Eurostat showed on Monday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.3 percent sequentially, slower than the
2.3 percent expansion seen in the third quarter. The rate came in line
with economists' expectations.

Although GDP marked a slowdown compared to growth in the third quarter,
that was to be expected given the moderating rebound effects, supply
chain problems and increased [coronavirus][2] infections, Bert Colijn,
an ING economist, said. The fact that GDP still continued to grow is a
sign of strength for the economy.

The small increase in GDP in the fourth quarter came as no surprise
given the country-level data published last week and shows that the
euro-zone economy was struggling at the end of last year, Jessica Hinds,
an economist at Capital Economics, said.

But restrictions in many countries are set to be lifted soon, allowing
the recovery to resume in the coming months, the economist added.

On a yearly basis, economic growth in the currency-bloc accelerated to
4.6 percent in the fourth quarter from 3.9 percent in the preceding
period. But this was slightly weaker than the expected rate of 4.7
percent.

The EU27 GDP grew 0.4 percent on quarter, taking the annual growth to
4.8 percent in the fourth quarter.

According to the first estimate for 2021, GDP expanded 5.2 percent in
both the euro area and the EU.

In Austria and Germany, where restrictions had to be tightened in the
fourth quarter to tackle the Delta variant, contracted from the previous
quarter. The German economy shrank 0.7 percent and Austria by 2.2
percent.

By contrast, France, Italy logged moderate growth of 0.7 percent and 0.6
percent, respectively. In Spain, GDP grew strongly by 2 percent.
