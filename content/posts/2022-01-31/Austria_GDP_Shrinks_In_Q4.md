Austria's [economy][1] contracted in the fourth quarter of 2021 as the
fourth lockdown dampened tourism, trade and transport, the flash
estimate from the WIFO economic institute showed on Monday.

Gross domestic product contracted 2.2 percent sequentially, reversing
the 3.8 percent expansion in the third quarter and the 4.2 percent rise
in the second quarter. GDP was forecast to climb 2.5 percent.

On the expenditure-side, household spending dropped 1.4 percent due to
the [health][2] [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) restriction, while government spending grew 0.2
percent.

Investment demand remained almost stable. Gross fixed capital formation
advanced 0.4 percent.

The slowdown in industry and lower demand for travel dampened the
foreign trade in the fourth quarter. Exports and imports declined 1.2
percent each from the previous quarter.

The production-side breakdown of GDP showed that industrial and
construction activity lost momentum against a background of supply
bottlenecks. Value added in industry fell 1.7 percent and a decline of
1.4 percent was recorded in the construction industry.

Value added in trade, accommodation, food service activities and
transport decreased 5.6 percent. In other services, which include
personal services, arts, [entertainment][3] and recreation, the decline
in value added was 5.8 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP expanded 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter, but
down from 5.6 percent in the preceding quarter.
