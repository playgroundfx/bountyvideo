The UK [economy][1] recovered in February despite the coronavirus
lockdown restrictions being in place, data from the Office for National
Statistics revealed Tuesday.

Gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent monthly, following a revised 2.2
percent fall in January. Nonetheless, this was slower than the expected
growth of 0.6 percent.

February's GDP was 7.8 percent below the levels seen in February 2020,
data showed. In the three months to February, GDP shrank 1.6 percent,
which was worse than a revised 1.4 percent contraction in the three
months to January.

The small rise in GDP does suggest that January was probably the low
point of the year, Thomas Pugh, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Vaccinations and the reopening of the economy will combine to trigger a
rapid rebound in activity over the next few months, the economist added.

Driven by wholesale and retail trade, services output gained 0.2 percent
in February. This followed a negative 2.5 percent growth in January.

The production sector also grew in February, by 1.0 percent, in contrast
to a 1.8 percent fall in January. This was mainly because of
manufacturing output picking up for the first time since November. After
falling 2.3 percent, manufacturing gained 1.3 percent in February.

Underpinned by new work and repair and maintenance, construction output
rose 1.6 percent. Nonetheless, the construction sector was 4.3 percent
below the level of February 2020.

On a yearly basis, industrial production fell 3.5 percent after easing
4.3 percent in January. Likewise, the decline in manufacturing output
slowed to 4.2 percent from 5.0 percent.

Another report from the ONS showed that the visible trade gap widened to
GBP 16.44 billion in February from GBP 12.59 billion in January. On a
monthly basis, exports and imports of goods increased 9.9 percent and
17.4 percent, respectively.

At the same time, the surplus on services trade came in at GBP 9.3
billion, largely unchanged from GBP 9.22 billion in the previous month.

As a result, the total trade deficit increased sharply to GBP 7.12
billion from GBP 3.37 billion a month ago.
