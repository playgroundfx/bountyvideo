New Zealand housing market is likely to undergo a pronounced correction,
the International Monetary Fund cautioned on Friday.

Concluding the Article IV discussions, IMF staff said rising speculative
demand for housing, along with [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low interest rates and
structural housing supply shortages, is amplifying the housing cycle and
heightens financial stability and affordability concerns.

Unsustainable house prices relative to income, a tightening of credit
standards, or a sharp rise in mortgage rates could trigger an eventual,
pronounced correction.

The IMF called for comprehensive approach in tackling supply-demand
imbalances in the housing sector. The staff observed that mitigating
near-term housing demand, particularly from [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, would help
moderate price pressures.

Further, the staff noted that although the economic activity fell
sharply due to the global pandemic, it recovered faster than expected in
the second half of 2020. The [economy][1] is expected to continue
recovering in the near term, though at a more moderate pace.
