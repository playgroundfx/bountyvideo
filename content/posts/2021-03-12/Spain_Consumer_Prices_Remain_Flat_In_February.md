Spain's consumer prices remained unchanged in February, as initially
estimated, after recovering a month ago, final data from the statistical
office INE showed on Friday.  
  
Consumer prices remained flat on year, in contrast to a 0.5 percent rise
in January, which was the first increase in eleven months. The rate came
in line with the estimate released on February 26.

Core inflation halved to 0.3 percent from 0.6 percent in the previous
month.  
  
Month-on-month, consumer prices slid 0.6 percent after showing nil
growth in January. This was the first decrease in seven months and
matched flash estimate.

the previous month.

On a monthly basis, the HICP dropped 0.6 percent after falling 0.4
