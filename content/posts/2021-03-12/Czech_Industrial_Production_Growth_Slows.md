The Czech Republic's industrial production grew at a slower than
expected pace January, preliminary figures from the Czech Statistical
Office showed Friday.  
  
Industrial production grew 0.9 percent year-on-year after a 2.5 percent
increase in February. Economists had expected 1.5 percent gain.  
  
Manufacturing output rose 0.8 percent, while mining and quarrying
production decreased 3.7 percent. Utility sector output rebounded with
1.9 percent growth.  
  
Compared to the previous month, industrial production decreased 0.4
percent in January.  
  
"Economic activities that usually contribute the most to an increase in
industrial production even reported a moderate year-on-year decrease in
January," Veronika Dolezalova, head of industrial statistics unit at
CSO, said.

"The considerable decrease of production in the manufacture of beverages
reflects the decreased long-term demand as a consequence of the
pandemic."

The value of new orders decreased 4.6 percent year-on-year in January,
driven by a 23.9 percent slump in the domestic bookings.

The statistical office also reported that the construction output
decreased 5.2 percent year-on-year in January. But it was higher by 4.2
percent from the previous month.
