India's industrial production dropped unexpectedly on weaker
manufacturing and mining output in January, data from the statistics
ministry revealed on Friday.

Industrial production logged an annual fall of 1.6 percent, in contrast
to the revised 1.6 percent expansion in December. Production was
expected to gain 0.9 percent.

The decline was driven by a 2 percent drop in manufacturing output and a
3.7 percent fall in mining output. Meanwhile, the annual decrease was
partially offset by the 5.5 percent growth in electricity output.

During April to January, industrial production was down 12.2 percent
from the same period last year.
