The UK unemployment dropped in three months to November and employment
increased reflecting continuing recovery in the labor market, the Office
for National Statistics said Tuesday.

The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent in three months to
November, while it was forecast to remain unchanged at 4.2 percent.

The employment rate increased by 0.2 percentage points on the quarter to
75.5 percent, data showed.

The end of the furlough has been more about a fall in the supply of
labor rather than a big fall in the demand for labor, Paul Dales, an
economist at Capital Economics, said. As a result, the unemployment rate
dropped marginally in three months to November.

During October to December, the number of job vacancies rose to a new
record of 1,247,000.

In December, the claimant count declined by 43,300 from the previous
month. The claimant count rate dropped marginally to 4.7 percent from
4.8 percent in November.  
  
There were 29.5 million employees in the UK, up 184,000 on the revised
November level.

Average earnings including bonus increased 4.2 percent annually in three
months to November, in line with expectations. Excluding bonus, average
earnings grew 3.8 percent, as expected.

Even though real wages are now falling and will decline further, the
Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates from 0.25 percent to
0.50 percent on February 3 and to 1.25 percent by December, the
economist said.
