German economic confidence improved more-than-expected to a six-month
high in January as the [economy][1] is expected to pick up over the
coming months, survey results from the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European
Economic Research showed on Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment rose to 51.7 in January from
29.9 in the previous month. The reading was well above the economists'
forecast of 32.0.

Meanwhile, the assessment of the economic situation worsened again in
the current survey. The corresponding index dropped 2.8 points to -10.2
in January. The expected reading was -8.5.

"The economic outlook has improved considerably with the start of the
new year," ZEW President Achim Wambach, said. The majority of financial
market experts assume that economic growth will pick up in the coming
six months.

It is likely that the phase of economic weakness from the fourth quarter
of 2021 will soon be overcome, said Wambach. The main reason for this is
the assumption that the incidence of COVID-19 cases will fall
significantly by early summer.

The more positive economic expectations include the consumer-related and
export-oriented sectors and thus a large part of the German economy, ZEW
President added.

The financial market experts' sentiment concerning the economic
development of the eurozone increased 22.6 points to 49.4 in January.
The current situation indicator fell to a new level of minus 6.2 points
from -2.3 in December.

Inflation expectations for the eurozone continued to decline in January.
The indicator came in at minus 38.7 points, which corresponds to a
decrease of 5.4 points from December. About 58 percent of the experts
expect the inflation rate to decline in the next six months.
