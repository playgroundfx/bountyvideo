European new car registrations declined for a sixth straight month in
December and decreased for the whole year 2021 mainly due to the
semiconductor shortage, the Â European Automobile Manufacturers'
Association (ACEA) showed Tuesday.  
  
New car registrations in the EU dropped 22.8 percent year-on-year to
795,295 units, after a 20.5 percent slump in November.  
  
In December 2020, sales were down 3.3 percent.  
  
Most [markets][1] in the EU saw double-digit drops in December.  
  
For the full year 2021, car registrations decreased 2.4 percent to 9.7
million units.

This fall was the result of the semiconductor shortage that negatively
impacted car production throughout the year, but especially during the
second half of 2021, the ACEA said.

In 2021, total EU car registrations were still 3.3 million units below
pre-crisis sales in 2019.

Germany's car sales decreased 26.9 percent in December and 10.1 percent
in 2021.  
  
France's car registrations slumped 15.1 percent in December, but grew
0.5 percent for the full year.  
  
Italy's new car sales dropped 27.5 percent annually in December, but
rose 5.5 percent in 2021, marking the biggest increase among the four
main markets in the region.

In Spain, new car sales tumbled 18.7 percent in December, while they
rose 1.0 percent for the full year.
