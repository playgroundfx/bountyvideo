Switzerland's producer and import prices rose in December, data from the
Federal Statistical Office showed on Tuesday.

Producer and import prices rose 5.1 percent year-on-year in December.

The producer price index rose 3.1 percent annually in December and
import prices increased 9.2 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer and import prices decreased 0.1 percent in
December.

Domestic sale prices gained 4.0 percent yearly in December and rose 0.1
percent from a month ago.

In 2021, average producer and import price inflation was 2.7 percent.

The latest increase was mainly due to higher prices for basic metals and
semi-finished metal products as well as for petroleum products, the
agency said.
