India's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged on Friday and
vowed to continue its accommodative stance as long as necessary.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India unanimously
voted to hold the benchmark [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 4.00 percent. The reverse
repo rate was retained at 3.35 percent.

The Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank Rate were also left
unchanged at 4.25 percent at the meeting.

The MPC also decided on a 5 to 1 majority to continue with the
accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth
on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on
the [economy][1], while ensuring that inflation remains within the
target, going forward.

Governor Shaktikanta Das said the Reserve Bank remains in "whatever it
takes" mode, with a readiness to deploy all its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers -
monetary, prudential or regulatory.

The bank has raised its inflation forecast for 2021-22 to 5.7 percent
from 5.1 percent. The growth outlook for 2021-22 was maintained at 9.5
percent.

Given the nascent and fragile economic recovery, the RBI decided to
extend the on-tap targeted long-term repo operations scheme further by a
period of three months.
