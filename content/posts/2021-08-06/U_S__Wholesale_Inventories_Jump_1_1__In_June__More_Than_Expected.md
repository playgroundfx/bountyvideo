The Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing wholesale
inventories in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the month of
June.

The report showed wholesale inventories jumped by 1.1 percent in June
after surging up by 1.3 percent in May. Economists had expected
wholesale inventories to climb by 0.8 percent.

Inventories of durable goods shot up by 1.4 percent during the month,
while inventories of non-durable goods rose by 0.6 percent.

The Commerce Department said wholesale sales also spiked by 2.0 percent
in June following a 0.8 percent increase in May.

While sales of durable goods jumped by 1.2 percent, sales of non-durable
goods soared by 2.9 percent during the month.

With sales increasing by more than inventories, the inventories/sales
ratio for merchant wholesalers edged down to 1.22 in June from 1.23 in
May.
