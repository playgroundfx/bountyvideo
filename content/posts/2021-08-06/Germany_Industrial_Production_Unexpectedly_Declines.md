Germany's industrial production unexpectedly declined in June as supply
shortages weighed on the manufacturing sector, data published by
Destatis revealed on Friday.

Industrial output dropped 1.3 percent in June from May, when production
was down by revised 0.8 percent. Economists had forecast production to
grow 0.5 percent in June.

The [economy][1] ministry said the main reason for the decline in
industrial production in the second quarter was supply bottlenecks for
semiconductors, especially in the automotive sector, which are still
causing problems at the moment.

The outlook for industrial activity as a whole remains cautiously
optimistic in the view of continued high demand, the ministry said.
Companies also continue to assess the export prospects as positive.

Compared with February 2020, the month before restrictions were imposed
due to the corona pandemic, production was 6.8 percent lower in June.

The further decline in German industrial output in June, to 6.8 percent
below its pre-pandemic level, underlines that the problems in the auto
sector will hold back an otherwise strong economic recovery, Andrew
Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

It is now uncertain whether GDP will regain its pre-pandemic level by
the fourth quarter of this year, as is widely expected, the economist
added.

In June, industrial production excluding energy and construction
decreased 0.9 percent from previous month. Energy production and
construction output fell 0.6 and 2.6 percent, respectively.

Within industry, capital goods production showed a monthly fall of 2.9
percent and that of intermediate goods dropped by 0.9 percent. On the
other hand, the production of consumer goods grew 3.4 percent.

Year-on-year, industrial output grew 5.1 percent, but slower than the
16.6 percent increase seen in May.

Elsewhere, a survey from ifo Institute showed that production
expectations weakened in July due to supply bottlenecks for intermediate
products. The production expectations indicator fell to 22 points in
July from 27 points in June.

Expectations improved in the automotive industry and clothing industry
in July.
