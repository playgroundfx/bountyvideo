Industrial output dropped 1.3 percent in June from May, when production
was down by revised 0.8 percent. Economists had forecast production to
grow 0.5 percent in June.

Excluding energy and construction, industrial production decreased 0.9

percent, respectively.

Within industry, capital goods production showed a monthly fall of 2.9
percent and that of intermediate goods dropped 0.9 percent. On the other
