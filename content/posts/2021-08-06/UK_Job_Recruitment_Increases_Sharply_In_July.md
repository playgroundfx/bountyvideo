UK recruitment activity increased sharply in July, while the
availability of candidates declined notably, results of the latest KPMG
and REC, UK Report on Jobs survey showed Friday.

The number of people placed into permanent jobs increased amid further
rollback of pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile, temp billings expanded at
the fastest pace since June 1998.

Driven by concerns over job security due to the pandemic, a lack of
European workers due to Brexit, and a generally low unemployment rate,
the availability of candidates continued to decline rapidly in July.

As a result, pay pressures intensified, with starting salaries climbing
the most in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and temp pay inflation also accelerating
notably in July.

Growth of demand for permanent staff hit a fresh series record, while
the upturn in temporary vacancies was the steepest since November 1997.

Kate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the REC, said "This month's
data confirms that it is a good time to be a looking for a new job."
"Skills shortages have been with us for a while and as our data shows
are getting worse."
