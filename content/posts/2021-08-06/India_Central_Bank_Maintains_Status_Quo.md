India's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record
low and pledged to continue its accommodative stance as long as
necessary despite inflation breaching its upper target band.

The six-member Monetary Policy Committee unanimously voted to hold the
benchmark [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 4.00 percent, the Reserve Bank of India said
Friday. The reverse repo rate was retained at 3.35 percent.

The Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank Rate were also left
unchanged at 4.25 percent at the meeting.

The MPC decided on a 5 to 1 majority to continue with the accommodative
stance to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to
mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the [economy][1], while ensuring that
inflation remains within the target, going forward.

Looking ahead, the central bank appears in no rush to tighten [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
Capital Economics economist Darren Aw said.

"We don't think [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization will start until the second half of
next year, and we suspect that it will begin with the slow removal of
liquidity support before [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates are increased," the economist
added.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the bank remains in "whatever it
takes" mode, with a readiness to deploy all its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) levers -
monetary, prudential or regulatory.

The governor also said the continued [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support from all sides -
fiscal, monetary and sectoral - is required to nurture the nascent and
hesitant recovery.

Inflation has remained above the central bank's tolerance band of 6
percent in May and June.

The RBI raised its inflation forecast for 2021-22 to 5.7 percent from
5.1 percent. Nonetheless, the bank said inflationary pressures are
transitory and largely driven by adverse supply side factors.

"The supply-side drivers could be transitory while demand-pull pressures
remain inert, given the slack in the economy," said Das.

"A pre-emptive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response at this stage may kill the
nascent and hesitant recovery that is trying to secure a foothold in
extremely difficult conditions."

The growth outlook for the current financial year was maintained at 9.5
percent. The bank noted that global commodity prices and financial
market volatility, coupled with vulnerability to new waves of infections
are downside risks to economic activity.

Given the nascent and fragile economic recovery, the RBI decided to
extend the on-tap targeted long-term repo operations program by three
months.

The bank decided to amend the guidelines related to export credit in
foreign currency and restructuring of derivative contracts.

Further, the RBI extended the deadlines for companies to meet certain
financial ratios that are required to avail the resolution plans
announced in August 2020.
