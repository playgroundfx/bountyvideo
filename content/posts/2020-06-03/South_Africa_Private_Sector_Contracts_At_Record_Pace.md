South Africa's private sector contracted the most on record in May as
lockdown measures to control the spread of [coronavirus][1], Covid-19,
were extended, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The headline Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 32.5 in May from 35.1 in
April. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. This
was the third consecutive decline.

Output levels contracted sharply in May and incoming new [business][2]
declined at a marked pace, as firms were unable to receive orders and
new work from abroad.

Backlogs of work eased in May and employment dropped for the seventh
month in a row. Suppliers' delivery time lengthened due to restrictions
on movement.

On the price front, purchase cost declined in May and output prices were
reduced.

The 12-month outlook for the business activity turned negative for the
first time in May.

"It is now expected that the [economy][3] will suffer an unprecedented
fall in GDP during the second quarter," David Owen, an economist at IHS
Markit, said.
