The Swiss [economy][1] contracted more than expected in the first
quarter as measures taken to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic
severely restricted economic activity in March, data from the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, showed Wednesday.

percent rise in the fourth quarter. Economists had forecast a 2 percent
contraction.

On a yearly basis, the economy shrank 1.3 percent after expanding 1.6
percent a quarter ago. This was also faster than the expected -0.9
percent.

Private consumption declined 3.5 percent sequentially in the first
quarter. Since shops were closed from March 17, purchases of furniture
and clothing dropped sharply, as well as spending on mobility, leisure
and [health][2].

Investment in construction dropped 0.4 percent and investment in
equipment was down 4.0 percent. The only domestic demand component to
underpin the economy was government consumption, which gained 0.7
percent.

Overall, final domestic demand fell 2.7 percent, the biggest decline in
recent decades.

Exports of goods rose 3.4 percent, while that of services fell 4.4
percent. At the same time, imports of goods decreased 1.1 percent and
