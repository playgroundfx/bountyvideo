After reporting a steep drop in new orders for U.S. manufactured goods
in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a report on
Wednesday showing another nosedive in factory orders in the month of
April.

The Commerce Department said new orders plunged by 13.0 percent in April
after plummeting by a revised 11.0 percent in March.

Economists had expected factory orders to tumble by 14.0 percent
compared to the 10.3 percent slump originally reported for the previous
month.

The continued nosedive in factory orders was partly due to another steep
drop in durable goods orders, which cratered by 17.7 percent in April
after tumbling by 16.7 percent in March.

The report showed orders for non-durable goods also plunged by 9.0
percent following a 5.4 percent slump in the previous month.

The Commerce Department said shipments of manufactured goods also
tumbled by 13.5 percent in April, while inventories of manufactured
goods dipped by 0.4 percent.

With shipments falling by much more than inventories, the inventories-
to-shipments ratio spiked to 1.69 in April from 1.46 in March.
