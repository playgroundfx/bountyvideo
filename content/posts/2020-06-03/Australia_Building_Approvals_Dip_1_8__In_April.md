The total number of building permits issued in Australia was down a
seasonally adjusted 1.8 percent on month in April, the Australian Bureau
of Statistics said on Wednesday - coming in at 15,294.

That beat expectations for a plunge of 15.0 percent following the 4.0
percent drop in March.

On a yearly basis, building permits were up 5.7 percent.

Permits issued for private sector houses rose 2.7 percent on month and
4.9 percent on year to 8,912, while permits issued for private sector
dwellings excluding houses fell 8.9 on month but rose 4.0 percent on
year to 6,079.
