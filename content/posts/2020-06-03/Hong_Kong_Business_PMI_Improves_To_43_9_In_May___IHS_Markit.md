Private sector activity in Hong Kong continued to contract in May,
albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 43.9.

That's up from 36.9 in April, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and new orders fell at their slowest rates since
January.

Job shedding eased, although [business][1] sentiment remained
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly weak.

Facing lower sales and increased spare capacity, firms reduced their
purchasing activity, inventories and staff numbers further in May.
