After reporting a record drop in private sector employment in the
previous month, payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday
showing the pace of job losses slowed by much more than anticipated in
the month of May.

ADP said private sector employment slumped by 2.76 million jobs in May
after plummeting by a revised 19.557 million jobs in April.

Economists had expected employment to tumble by about 9.0 million jobs
compared to 20.236 million job nosedive originally reported for the
previous month.
