The services sector in China turned to expansion in May, the latest
survey from Caixin revealed on Wednesday with a services PMI score of
55.0.

That's up from 44.4 in April and it moves above the boom-or-bust line of
50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, [business][1] activity and new work rose at the quickest
rates since 2010. The pandemic continued to weigh heavily on export
orders, and employment fell slightly as firms looked to raise
efficiency.

The survey also showed that its composite index jumped to 54.5 in May,
up from 47.6 in the previous month.
