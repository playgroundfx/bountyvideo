South Korea posted a current account deficit of $3.12 billion in April,
the Bank of Korea said on Thursday.

The goods account surplus narrowed to $0.82 billion, compared to $5.61
billion in April.

The services account deficit increased to $1.42 billion, from $1.27
billion in April 2019, owing to a deterioration in the use of the
intellectual property account.

from $4.18 billion a year earlier, in line with a decrease in the
payment of dividends.

The secondary income account recorded a $0.25 billion deficit.

Direct investment assets added $0.66 billion, and direct investment
liabilities increased by $0.55 billion.
