Private sector activity in Singapore continued to contract in May, and
at a steeper rate, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 27.1.

That's down from 28.1 in April, and it moves further beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output and demand plummeted as businesses remained
shuttered.

Business confidence fell to a record low as spare capacity grew while
firms reduced employment.

Cost pressures eased substantially during May as a result of government
subsidies and businesses' efforts to reduce expenses.
