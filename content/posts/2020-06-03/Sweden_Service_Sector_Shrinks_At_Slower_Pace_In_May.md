Sweden's services sector contracted at a slower pace in May, survey data
from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF showed on Wednesday.

The Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector increased to 40.9
in May from 39.0 in April. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in
the sector.

There are no clear signs of an imminent recovery in the [business][1]
cycle, Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar said.

Order intake showed the largest increase in May, followed by employment.
Meanwhile, suppliers' delivery time lengthened and business volume
declined in May.

The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services, rose to
40.5 in May from 38.3 in the previous month.

However, the outlook for the Swedish business sector for the next few
months remains challenging, Kennemar said.
