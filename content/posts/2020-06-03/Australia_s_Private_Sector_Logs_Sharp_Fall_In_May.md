Australia's private sector contracted substantially in May as ongoing
measures to contain the spread of the [coronavirus][1] continued to hit
demand, survey results from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The Commonwealth Bank services Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to
26.9 in May from 19.5 in the previous month. However, a score below 50
indicates contraction.

Although the pace of contraction was slower than in April, the rate of
decline was the second-fastest in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

The rate of decline in both activity and new orders eased in May.
Moreover, [business][2] confidence improved markedly due to expectations
of a further easing of containment measures.

The Commonwealth Bank composite output index came in at 28.1 versus 21.7
in the previous month. The score suggested a severe decrease in overall
business activity.
