Eurozone producer prices continued to fall in April due to weak energy
prices, data from Eurostat showed Wednesday.

Producer prices logged an annual fall of 4.5 percent, faster than the
2.8 percent decrease seen in March. Economists had forecast a decrease
of 4 percent.

Excluding energy, producer prices dropped 0.3 percent after rising 0.2
percent a month ago. Energy prices were down 16.5 percent in April.

Month-on-month, producer prices slid 2 percent in April, following a 1.5
percent decrease in March. This was the third straight decrease in
prices. Prices were expected to drop 1.8 percent.

In the EU27, industrial producer prices dropped 1.9 percent on month in
April and 4.3 percent from a year ago.
