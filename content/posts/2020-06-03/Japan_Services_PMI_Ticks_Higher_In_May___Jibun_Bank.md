Services sector activity in Japan continued to contract in May, albeit
at a slower rate, the latest survey from Jibun Bank revealed on
Wednesday with a PMI score of 26.5.

That's up from 21.5 in April, although it remains well beneath the boom-
or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output continued to drop at record levels due to Covid-19
closings.

Demands for Japanese services continued to fall sharply, while
employment fell at its sharpest rate since February 2010.

Also, the composite index improved to 27.8 in May - up from the record
low 25.8 in April.
