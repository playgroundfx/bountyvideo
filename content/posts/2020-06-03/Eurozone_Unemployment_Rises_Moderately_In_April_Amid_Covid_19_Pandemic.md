The euro area unemployment rate increased only moderately in April
despite containment measures implemented to prevent the spread of
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, across member countries.

The jobless rate rose to a three-month high of 7.3 percent in April from
7.1 percent in March, data from Eurostat showed Wednesday. But this was
below economists' forecast of 8.2 percent.

The number of unemployed increased by 211,000 from March to 11.919
million in April.  
  
The unemployment rate among euro area youth aged below 25 rose to 15.8
percent in April from 15.1 percent in March.

Massive filings for short-time work schemes across the Eurozone have
subdued the increase in unemployment, Bert Colijn, an ING economist,
said.

As the recovery is likely going to last for quite some time,
unemployment is set to rise significantly although short-time work will
help output to recover more quickly once demand returns, the economist
noted.

Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said the
remarkably small increase in unemployment in the euro-zone reflects the
success of the government job subsidy schemes and an exodus from the
labour force in Italy.

"We suspect that the unemployment rate will rise further in the coming
months, but not as far as we had feared," Kenningham added.

Meanwhile, Italy's jobless rate decreased to the lowest level in more
than twelve years in April.

The jobless rate fell to 6.3 percent in April from 8.0 percent in March,
the statistical office Istat reported. Economists had expected the rate
to rise to 9.5 percent. A similar lower rate was last reported in
November 2007.

The number of jobseekers decreased to 1.543 million in April from 2.027
million in the preceding month.

Elsewhere, data from the Federal Labor Agency showed that German
unemployment rose by 238,000 to 2.875 million in May. Economists had
forecast an increase of 200,000.

The jobless rate climbed to 6.3 percent in May from 5.8 percent in
April. This was also above economists' forecast of 6.2 percent.

The labour market remains under a lot of pressure due to the coronavirus
pandemic, Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said.

In a report released Tuesday, the ifo Institute said about 7.3 million
employees in Germany were on short-time work in May. During the
financial crisis, short-time work peaked in May 2009 with just under 1.5
million people affected.
