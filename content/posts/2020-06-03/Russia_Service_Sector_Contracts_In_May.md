Russia's service sector registered considerable contraction in May, due
to the control measures taken to reduce the spread of [coronavirus][1],
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 35.9 in May from 12.2 in
April. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. This
was the second-fastest decline since early-2009.

Output decreased due to weaker client demand in May. Export demand
declined at the second-steepest pace on record, amid the ongoing
lockdowns and travel restrictions.

Firms reduced their staffing levels in May and backlogs of work fell
considerably as new [business][2] inflows declined further.

Negative sentiment eased in May and companies foresee a decline in the
business activity in the next 12 months.

On the price front, firms reduced their output charges for the second
straight month. The rate of cost inflation was below the long-run series
average.

The composite output index increased to 35.0 in May from 13.9 in April.
The score suggested contraction in the manufacturing and services
sectors.

"Business activity at Russian service providers continued to be stymied
by emergency public [health][3] measures in response to the COVID-19
pandemic," Si√¢n Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
