The euro area private sector contracted sharply in May, but improved
from April as lockdown restrictions implemented to prevent the spread of
[coronavirus][1] loosened in many economies, survey results from IHS
Markit showed on Wednesday.

The final composite output index rose to 31.9 in May from April's record
low of 13.6. The score was above the flash reading of 30.5.

A score below 50 indicates contraction in the private sector.
Respondents noted that containment measures continued to have a severe
impact on economic performance.

Chris Williamson, chief [business][2] economist at IHS Markit said he
remained cautious with respect to the recovery. "Our forecasters expect
GDP to slump by almost 9% in 2020 and for a recovery to prepandemic
levels of output to take several years."

New business continued to fall markedly in May and companies reduced
their employment. Whilst there remained evidence of companies continuing
to take advantage of furlough schemes, the net fall in employment
remained severe and amongst the greatest in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

According to Eurostat, the unemployment rate in the currency bloc rose
to 7.3 percent in April from 7.1 percent in March.

Business confidence remained negative overall in May, data from Markit
showed. Data showed reductions in both operating costs and charges.

The final services Purchasing Managers' Index advanced to a three-month
high of 30.5 from a record low 12.0 posted in April. The flash reading
was 28.7.

The four largest euro area economies registered slower, albeit severe
contractions in activity.

Italy was the best-performing, followed by Germany and France. Spain
remained the weakest performing nation in May.

Germany's private sector remained in deep contraction territory in May.
The final composite output index came in at 32.3 in May, but up from a
historic low of 17.4 in April and the flash 31.4.

The services PMI advanced to 32.6 from 16.2 a month ago. The flash score
was 31.4.

France's business conditions remained among the weakest since data
collection began just over 22 years ago. The final composite PMI
advanced to 32.1 from 11.1 in April. This was above the flash reading of
30.5.

At the same time, the services PMI increased to 31.1 from 10.2 a month
ago and was better than the flash 29.4.

Italy's private sector also logged one of the fastest fall on record in
May. The composite output index climbed to 33.9 from 10.9 a month ago.
The services PMI came in at 28.9 versus 10.8 in April.

Similarly, Spain's private sector logged weaker contraction in May. The
composite PMI posted 29.2 versus 9.2 in April. At the same time, the
services PMI improved to 27.9 from 7.1 in the previous month.
