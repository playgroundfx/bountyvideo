The manufacturing sector in Taiwan continued to expand in November,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Wednesday with a seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI score of 54.9.

That's down from 55.2 in October, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

After rising in each of the prior 16 months, manufacturing production in
Taiwan fell slightly in November. Panelists indicated that supplier
delays and shortages of key components had weighed on production
schedules, alongside relatively muted customer demand.

Though strong overall, the latest upturn in total new work was not as
marked as that seen in October and notably softer than the average for
2021 so far. New [business][1] from abroad also rose solidly, albeit at
the weakest pace for 14 months.
