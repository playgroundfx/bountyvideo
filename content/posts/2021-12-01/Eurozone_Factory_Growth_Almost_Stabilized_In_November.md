The euro area manufacturing sector growth nearly stabilized in November,
following a four-month slowdown from June's record expansion, final
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The factory Purchasing Managers' Index rose slightly to 58.4 in November
from 58.3 in the previous month. The flash reading was 58.6. A reading
above 50.0 indicates expansion.

Production increased strongly in November. A similar trend was observed
in new order inflows.

Average input lead times lengthened to a substantial extent once again.
Nevertheless, both purchases and stocks of inputs increased at sharper
rates during November.  
  
There was substantial increase in costs which was the third-strongest in
the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). To alleviate pressures on margins, output prices
were raised to the greatest extent since this series began in November
2002.

"Looking ahead, rising COVID-19 infection rates cast a darkening cloud
over the near-term outlook, threatening to further disrupt supply chains
while at the same time diverting spending from consumer services to
consumer goods again, therefore worsening the imbalance of supply and
demand," Chris Williamson, chief [business][1] economist at IHS Markit
said.

Among big-four economies, growth in Germany and Spain slowed from
October, while France and Italy posted stronger expansions.

German manufacturers continued to struggle to increase production
volumes amid ongoing supply-side constraints. The final IHS Markit/BME
factory PMI slipped to 57.4 in November from 57.8 in October and the
lowest in ten months. The score was below the flash 57.6.

On the other hand, France's manufacturing sector growth accelerated for
the first time in six months in November. The manufacturing PMI rose to
55.9 in November from 53.6 in October. The flash score was 54.6.

Italy was the clear stand-out performer, with growth here accelerating
to a survey high, driven by strong production and new work. The
manufacturing PMI advanced to 62.8 in November from 61.1 in October.
Economists had forecast the index to remain unchanged at 61.1.

Spain's manufacturing sector growth slowed in November due to supply
constraints and price pressures. The manufacturing PMI registered 57.1
in November, down from 57.4 in October. The score was forecast to rise
to 57.9.
