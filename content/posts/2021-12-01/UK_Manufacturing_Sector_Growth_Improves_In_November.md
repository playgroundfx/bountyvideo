The UK manufacturing sector grew at a faster pace in November despite
stretched supply chains disrupting production schedule, final survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index rose to a three-month high of 58.1 in November from 57.8
in October. The flash reading was 58.2.

Production increased for the eighteenth month in a row in November, with
the rate of expansion accelerating slightly from October's eight-month
low.

The strain on supply chains also led to further substantial lengthening
of average vendor lead times. Average purchase prices grew at a record
pace largely due to the shortages of components.

New [business][1] continued to expand in November, underpinned by
stronger market conditions, returning customers and rising client
confidence. Meanwhile, the trend in new export orders worsened.

Further, the survey showed that employment grew for the eleventh
straight month and at the quickest pace since August.

UK manufacturers maintained a positive outlook during November, with
business optimism rising to a three-month high.

Manufacturers are facing a challenging backdrop, with rising supply
chain disruptions, staff shortages and inflationary pressures stifling
growth while ongoing difficulties caused by Brexit and logistical
headaches restrict opportunities to expand into overseas [markets][2],
Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said.
