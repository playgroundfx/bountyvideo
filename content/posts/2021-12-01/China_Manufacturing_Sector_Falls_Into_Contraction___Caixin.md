The manufacturing sector in China slipped into contraction territory in
November, the latest survey from Caixin revealed on Wednesday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 49.9.

That's down from 50.6 in October and it falls beneath the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Chinese manufacturing output rose for the first time since July during
November, though the rate of expansion was only fractional. Panel
members indicated that firmer market conditions and a relative
improvement in energy supply had supported higher production. That said,
subdued customer demand, rising costs and limited power supply at some
firms dampened overall growth.

Total new work fell marginally in November, following two months of
expansion. Some firms linked relatively muted demand conditions to the
pandemic and high output prices. New work from abroad also fell, albeit
at the softest rate for four months, amid reports of reduced foreign
demand due to the ongoing pandemic and challenges in shipping items to
clients.
