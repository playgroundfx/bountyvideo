The manufacturing sector in Myanmar continued to contract in November,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 46.7.

That's up from 43.3 in October although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Production volumes at goods producers in Myanmar contracted further in
November, albeit at a softer pace. The decline was again linked to
material scarcity, staff shortages and ongoing political disruption.

Meanwhile, new orders fell marginally, at the softest pace in the
current 15-month sequence of decline and at a rate that was softer than
the long-run series average. There were reports of a pick-up in footfall
and a resumption in [business][1] operations.
