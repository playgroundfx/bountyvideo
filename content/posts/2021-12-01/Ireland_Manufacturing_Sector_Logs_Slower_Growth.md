Ireland's manufacturing sector logged a slower growth in November, data
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The factory Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 59.9 in November from
62.1 in October. Nonetheless, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion
in the sector.  
  
The latest figure signaled the slowest overall improvement in Irish
manufacturing [business][1] conditions since March.

The survey showed that growth rates for output, new orders, employment
and purchasing all eased since October, but remained strong overall.
Supply chains remained under severe pressure, though there was evidence
of less disruption compared with October.

On the price front, data showed that input price inflation was the
second-fastest ever, leading to a record increase in factory gate
prices.
