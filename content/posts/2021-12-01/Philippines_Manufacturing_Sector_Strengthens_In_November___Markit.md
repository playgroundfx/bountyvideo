The manufacturing sector in the Philippines continued to expand in
November, and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics
showed on Wednesday with a seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI score
of 51.7.

That's up from 51.0 in October and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Although only modest, the latest uptick was the strongest in eight
months, and in line with the long-run series average. Central to the
uptick was an expansion in new orders received by Filipino
manufacturers, with new sales rising for the first time since March.

Higher client numbers, increased footfall, and a general improvement in
customer demand were the key drivers of growth, according to panelists.
The rate of growth was subdued in the context of the series [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/),
however.
