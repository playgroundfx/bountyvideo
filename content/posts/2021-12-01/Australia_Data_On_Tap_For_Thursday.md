Australia is scheduled to release a batch of data on Thursday, setting
the pace for a modest day in Asia-Pacific economic activity. On tap are
October figures for imports, exports, trade balance, retail sales and
home loans.

Retail sales are expected to rise 4.9 percent on month, accelerating
from 1.3 percent in September. Home loans are tipped to fall 1.0 percent
on month after slipping 2.7 percent in the previous month.

The trade surplus is pegged at A$11 billion, down from A$12.243 billion
a month earlier - when imports dipped 2.0 percent on month and exports
sank 6.0 percent.  
  
Japan will see November results for its consumer confidence index; in
October, the index score was 39.2.

November figures for consumer prices. GDP was up 0.8 percent on quarter

percent on month and rise 3.1 percent on year after gaining 0.1 percent
on month and 3.2 percent on year in October.
