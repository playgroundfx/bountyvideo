The manufacturing sector in Thailand continued to expand in November,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Wednesday with a seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI score of 50.6.

That's down from 50.9 in October, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

A further easing of COVID-19 restrictions saw manufacturing output in
Thailand rise for a third consecutive month. Instances of better
domestic demand supported the rise in production according to survey
respondents.

Overall demand however remained subdued in the Thai manufacturing
sector, accounted for by lingering COVID-19 disruptions according to
anecdotal evidence. Foreign demand notably fell at a faster rate despite
Thailand having reopened to vaccinated visitors.
