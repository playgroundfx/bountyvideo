U.S. economic activity grew at a modest to moderate pace during October
and early November, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in each of the twelve Fed districts, was released Wednesday
afternoon, two weeks ahead of the next monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting.

The Fed noted that several districts experienced strong demand, but
growth was constrained by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted during Congressional testimony that the
emergence of the Omicron variant of the [coronavirus][1] could slow
progress in the labor market and further intensify supply-chain
disruptions.

The Beige Book said consumer spending increased modestly during the
period, although low inventories held back sales of some items, notably
light vehicles.

Meanwhile, the report said leisure and hospitality activity picked up in
most districts as the spread of the Delta variant ebbed in many areas.

While materials and labor shortages limited expansion, the Fed said
manufacturing growth was also solid across the districts.

The Beige Book also said employment growth ranged from modest to strong
across, as [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s reported robust demand for labor but persistent
difficulty in hiring and retaining employees.

With regard to inflation, the Fed said wide-ranging input cost increases
stemming from strong demand for raw materials, logistical challenges,
and labor market tightness led to widespread price hikes.
