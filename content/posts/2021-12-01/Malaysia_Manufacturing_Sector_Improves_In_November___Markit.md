The manufacturing sector in Malaysia continued to expand in November,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 52.3.

That's up from 52.2 in October and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Survey gauges of both output and new orders signaled further expansions
in November. The former saw the rate of increase quicken from October to
reach the fastest since April.

Companies reported that the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions had boosted
demand and client confidence in domestic and international [markets][1].
While new export orders fell for the seventh month in a row, the pace of
moderation eased to the joint-softest in this sequence as firms
commented on pockets of improved demand, notably in the Asia-Pacific
region.
