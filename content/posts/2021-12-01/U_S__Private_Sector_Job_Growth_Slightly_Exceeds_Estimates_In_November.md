A report released by payroll processor ADP on Wednesday showed private
sector employment in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected
in the month of November.

ADP said private sector employment shot up by 534,000 jobs in November
after surging by a revised 570,000 jobs in October.

Economists had expected private sector employment to jump by about
525,000 jobs compared to the addition of 571,000 jobs originally
reported for the previous month.

"November's job gains bring the three month average to 543,000 monthly
jobs added, a modest uptick from the job pace earlier this year," said
ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. "Job gains have eclipsed 15 million
since the recovery began, though 5 million jobs short of pre-pandemic
levels."

"Service providers, which are more vulnerable to the pandemic, have
dominated job gains this year," she added. "It's too early to tell if
the Omicron variant could potentially slow the jobs recovery in coming
months."

The report showed employment in the service-providing sector spiked by
424,000 jobs in November, reflecting notable job growth in leisure and
hospitality and professional/businesses services industries.

Employment in the goods-producing sector also jumped by 110,000 jobs, as
employment in the construction and manufacturing industries rose by
52,000 jobs and 50,000 jobs, respectively.

ADP said employment at large businesses surged by 277,000 jobs, while
midsized businesses added 142,000 jobs and employment at small
businesses increased by 115,000 jobs.

Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said the
strength in the labor market supports Federal Reserve Chair Jerome
Powell's comments suggesting the central bank might need to end its
asset purchase program a few months earlier than previously planned.

"That said, we do expect payroll growth to ease back soon as, regardless
of what happens with the Omicron [coronavirus][1] variant, rising Delta
infection rates in the Northeast and Midwest begin to weigh on demand a
little," Ashworth added.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment report, which includes both public and
private sector jobs.

Employment is expected to jump by 550,000 jobs in November after surging
by 531,000 jobs in October, while the unemployment rate is expected to
edge down to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent.
