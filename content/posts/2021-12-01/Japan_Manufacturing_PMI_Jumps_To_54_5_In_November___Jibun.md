The manufacturing sector in Japan continued to expand in November, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from Jibun Bank showed on Wednesday
with a seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI score of 54.5.

That's up from 53.2 in October and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This signaled the strongest improvement in the [health][1] of the sector
since January 2018, and the tenth consecutive month of overall growth.

The improvement in operating conditions stemmed from a second successive
rise in production volumes in November, and at the fastest pace since
April. Firms often attributed this to improved orders, particularly in
the production of inputs and intermediate goods. That said, growth was
held back slightly by reports of difficulties in sourcing and receiving
raw materials.
