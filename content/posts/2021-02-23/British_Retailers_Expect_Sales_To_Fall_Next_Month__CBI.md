UK retailers expect sales to fall sharply next month, according to the
Distributive Trades Survey results from the Confederation of British
Industry, published Tuesday.

A net balance of 45 percent said sales declined in the year to February
compared to -50 percent in January. However, a net 62 percent forecast
sales to decline further in March.

The retail order balance came in at -36 versus -45 percent in January. A
net 59 percent expects another deterioration in the year to March.

Among retailers, only grocers registered any growth in volumes in
February, with non-store sales flat and other retail sectors reporting
sharp declines.

Nonetheless, the survey showed a record internet sales growth in
February with another [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly strong performance expected in the
year to March.  
  
"Record growth in internet shopping suggests that retailers' investments
in on-line platforms and click-and-collect services maybe paying off,
but the re-opening of the sector can't come soon enough to protect jobs
and breathe life back into the sector," Ben Jones, CBI principal
economist, said.

Retail employment decreased for the 17th consecutive quarter. A net 44
percent said employment declined in the year to February. A similar
percent expects another fall in the year to March.
