In a widely anticipated move, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on
Tuesday told members of the Senate Banking Committee the central bank is
likely to maintain ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for the foreseeable
future.

Powell's prepared remarks largely mirrored recent assessments,
indicating interest rates will remain at near-zero levels and the Fed
will continue its asset purchases at the current rate until "substantial
further progress" has been made toward its goals of maximum employment
and price stability.

"The [economy][1] is a long way from our employment and inflation goals,
and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to
be achieved," Powell said.

The comments from Powell come as recent concerns about the outlook for
inflation have contributed to an increase in treasury yields, with the
yields on ten-year notes and thirty-year bonds reaching their highest
levels since the early days of the [coronavirus][2] pandemic.

Powell acknowledged that consumer prices have partially rebounded
following the steep drop last spring but noted prices for sectors that
have been most adversely affected by the pandemic remain "particularly
soft."

The Fed chief said annual inflation remains below the central bank's 2
percent target and reiterated monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is likely to remain
unchanged until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for
"some time."

"While we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face,
developments point to an improved outlook for later this year," Powell
said. "In particular, ongoing progress in vaccinations should help speed
the return to normal activities.

He added, "In the meantime, we should continue to follow the advice of
[health][3] experts to observe social-distancing measures and wear
masks."

Powell stressed that the Fed remains committed to using its full range
of tools to support the economy and to help ensure the recovery will be
as robust as possible.
