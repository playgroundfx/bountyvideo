Singapore's consumer prices rose in January, data from the Monetary
Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed on
Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 0.2 year-on-year in January, after
remaining unchanged in December. This was in line with economists'
expectations.

This latest consumer prices outcome was largely due to a rise in core
inflation and prices for private transportation cost, and accommodation
inflation.

MAS core CPI, which excludes costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.2 percent annually in January, following a 0.3 percent
decrease in the preceding month.

The fall, which was due to a smaller decline in service costs, matched
economists' expectations.

The statistical office expects external inflation to rise in the coming
quarters, amid a recovery in global oil prices.

Domestic cost pressures are expected to stay low, as wage growth and
commercial rent are likely to remain subdued.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation averaged -0.2
percent in 2020, the statistical office and MAS said.

For 2021, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average 0-1 percent, while
the CPI-All Items inflation is projected to be between -0.5 and 0.5
percent.
