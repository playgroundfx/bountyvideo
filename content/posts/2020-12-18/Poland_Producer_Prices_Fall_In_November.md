Poland's producer prices declined at a softer pace in November, data
from Statistics Poland showed on Friday.

The producer price index fell 0.2 percent year-on-year in November,
following a 0.4 percent decline in October. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

Prices for manufacturing declined 0.9 percent yearly in November.

Meanwhile, prices for mining and quarrying accelerated 6.4 percent.
Prices for water supply and electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning
supply gained 6.3 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices remained unchanged in November,
after a 0.6 percent fall in the preceding month.
