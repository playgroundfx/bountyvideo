UK manufacturing orders grew at the strongest pace in ten months in
December as the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine raised hopes for the
future, the Industrial Trends Survey from the Confederation of British
Industry showed Friday.

The order book balance rose to -25 percent in December from -40 percent
in November. This was the highest since February 2020. However, they
remained below the long-run average of -14 percent.

The export order books balance improved moderately to -44 percent from
-51 percent in the previous month.

Manufacturers reported a slower decline in output volume in three months
to December. A net balance of -6 percent expect output to fall in the
next quarter.

Manufacturers expect muted pricing pressure in the next three months.

Tom Crotty, Group Director at INEOS and Chair of the CBI Manufacturing
Council, said 2020 has been an incredibly difficult year for
manufacturers, as firms have had to deal with the dual impact of a
global pandemic and continued Brexit uncertainty.

"One of the key ways the government can help manufacturers is to strike
a Brexit deal, as manufacturing is one of the sectors that would be
hardest hit by a no deal Brexit," Crotty said.
