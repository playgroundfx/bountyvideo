German [business][1] confidence improved in December as managers were
more satisfied with their current situation and less skeptical about
future, survey results released by the Munich-based ifo Institute showed
Friday.

The business confidence index rose unexpectedly to 92.1 in December from
revised 90.9 in the previous month. The score was forecast to ease to
90.0 from November's initially estimated value of 90.7.

While the lockdown is hitting certain sectors hard, overall the German
[economy][2] is showing resilience, Clemens Fuest, ifo President said.

Both current assessment and expectations advanced from November. The
current conditions indicator came in at 91.3, up from 90.0 a month ago.
Economists had forecast the reading to fall to 89.0.

The expectations index improved to 92.8 in December from 91.8, which was
above the expected reading of 92.5.

The increase in business confidence for December supports the assessment
that Germany will avoid a contraction in the fourth quarter, Melanie
Debono, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

But the new tightening in [coronavirus][3] restrictions, which came into
effect this week, means that activity will remain subdued at the start
of the New Year, before picking up in the second quarter, Debono noted.

The majority of the survey responses were collected before the decision
to impose a tougher lockdown. The closure of non-essential shops until
at least January 10 will weigh on retail and service sectors.

In manufacturing, business sentiment rose markedly in December.
Assessments of the current situation hit its highest level since
January. Optimism regarding the coming six months also increased
noticeably.

In the service sector, the business climate indicator recovered
somewhat. Companies were more satisfied with their current situation and
their expectations were also a little less pessimistic.

In trade, the business climate improved and remained unchanged in the
construction sector, the survey showed.
