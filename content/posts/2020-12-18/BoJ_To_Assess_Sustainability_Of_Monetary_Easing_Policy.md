The Bank of Japan said it is set to assess the sustainability of
monetary easing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as consumer prices are expected to remain under
downward pressure for a prolonged period due to the Covid-19 impact.

As economic activity and prices have remained under prolonged downward
pressure, there is a need to support the [economy][1] and thereby
achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, the bank said.

The bank viewed that there is no need to change the framework of "QQE
with Yield Curve Control". The bank is set to announce its findings at
the March 2021 meeting.

The announcement came after the official data showed that core consumer
prices fell 0.9 percent in November, which was the fastest in more than
a decade.

It is possible that today's meeting marks the beginning of the end of
the Bank's negative interest rate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Marcel Thieliant, an economist
at Capital Economics, said.

The Policy Board of the BoJ governed by Haruhiko Kuroda decided to
extend the timeframe for emergency loan facility by six months to
September 2021.

The bank also removed upper limit of JPY 100 billion on funds provided
to eligible counterparty against loans that financial institutions make
on their own.  
  
The board voted 8-1 to retain the interest rate at -0.1 percent on
current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central
bank.

The bank will continue to purchase necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.
