A report released by the Conference Board on Friday showed its index of
leading U.S. economic indicators increased by slightly more than
expected in the month of November.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index rose by 0.6 percent
in November after climbing by 0.8 percent in October. Economists had
expected the index to increase by 0.5 percent.

"Initial claims for unemployment insurance, new orders for
manufacturing, residential construction permits, and stock prices made
the largest positive contributions to the LEI," said Ataman Ozyildirim,
Senior Director of Economic Research at The Conference Board.

He added, "However, falling average working hours in manufacturing and
consumers' worsening outlook underscore the downside risks to growth
from a second wave of COVID-19 and high unemployment."

The report said the coincident economic index edged up by 0.2 percent in
November after rising by 0.6 percent in October.

The lagging economic index also increased by 0.4 percent in November
after climbing by 0.3 percent in the previous month.
