Data released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed new orders for
U.S. manufactured goods increased for the sixth consecutive month in
October.

The Commerce Department said factory orders climbed by 1.0 percent in
October after surging by an upwardly revised 1.3 percent in September.

Economists had expected factory orders to increase by 0.8 percent
compared to the 1.1 percent jump originally reported for the previous
month.

The report said orders for durable goods shot up by 1.3 percent,
unchanged from the previously published increase, while orders for non-
durable goods rose by 0.7 percent.

Shipments of manufactured goods also increased for the sixth consecutive
month, jumping by 1.0 percent in October after rising by 0.5 percent in
September.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said inventories ticked up by 0.2
percent in October after edging down by 0.1 percent in September.

With shipments rising by more than inventories, the inventories-to-
shipments ratio slipped to 1.41 in October from 1.42 in September.
