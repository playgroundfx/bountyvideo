A closely watched report released by the Labor Department on Friday
showed U.S. job growth slowed by much more than anticipated in the month
of November.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 245,000
jobs in November after jumping by a downwardly revised 610,000 jobs in
October.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 469,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 638,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

Despite the weaker than expected job growth, the unemployment rate
dipped to 6.7 percent in November from 6.9 percent in October. The
unemployment rate was expected to edge down to 6.8 percent.
