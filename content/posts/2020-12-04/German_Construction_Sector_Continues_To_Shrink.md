Germany's construction sector continued to contract in November amid
uncertainty caused by the pandemic and fewer public sector tender
opportunities, survey data from IHS Markit showed Friday.

The construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 45.6 in November
from 45.2 in the previous month. This was the highest since August.

However, the score has been below the 50 no-change threshold for the
ninth straight month indicating contraction in the sector.

Housing activity remained the sector's bright spot, with work on
residential projects increasing for the fifth consecutive month in
November. This contrasted with ongoing weakness in both commercial and
civil engineering activity, with these two categories exhibiting
similarly steep rates of decline.

Phil Smith, associate director at IHS Markit, said "After back-to-back
contractions in the second and third quarters, German construction
activity still looks to be stuck in a downturn as we approach the end of
the year, according to these latest PMI results."
