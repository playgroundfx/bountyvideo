With the value of imports rising by more than the value of exports, the
Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing the U.S. trade
deficit widened in the month of October.

The report said the trade deficit widened to $63.1 billion in October
from a revised $62.1 billion in September. Economists had expected the
deficit to widen to $64.8 billion from the $63.9 billion originally
reported for the previous month.

The wider deficit came as the value of imports increased by $5.0 billion
or 2.1 percent to $245.1 billion, while the value of exports climbed by
$4.0 billion or 2.2 percent to $182.0 billion.
