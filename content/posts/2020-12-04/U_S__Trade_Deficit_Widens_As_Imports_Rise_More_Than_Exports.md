With the value of imports rising by more than the value of exports, the
Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing the U.S. trade
deficit widened in the month of October.

The report said the trade deficit widened to $63.1 billion in October
from a revised $62.1 billion in September. Economists had expected the
deficit to widen to $64.8 billion from the $63.9 billion originally
reported for the previous month.

The wider deficit came as the value of imports increased by $5.0 billion
or 2.1 percent to $245.1 billion, while the value of exports climbed by
$4.0 billion or 2.2 percent to $182.0 billion.

The increase in the value of imports reflected notable growth in imports
of cell phones and other household goods, computer accessories and
industrial supplies and materials.

Meanwhile, significant growth in exports of natural gas, organic
chemicals, civilian aircraft and semiconductors contributed to the
increase in the value of exports.

"With a slowdown in consumption weighing on goods imports and the
recovery in production and exports still catching up, the trade deficit
is likely to be little changed over the coming months," said Michael
Pearce, U.S. Senior Economist at Capital Economics.

The report said the goods deficit widened to $81.4 billion in October
from $80.8 billion in September, while the services surplus fell to
$18.3 billion from $18.7 billion.
