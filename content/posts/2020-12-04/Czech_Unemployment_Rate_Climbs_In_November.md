The Czech Republic's unemployment rate rose in November, reversing the
easing in the previous month, data from the Ministry of Labor and Social
Affairs showed on Friday.

The jobless rate rose to 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent in October. That
was in line with economists' expectations.

In September, the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent. In November 2019,
the rate was 2.6 percent.

The number of registered job-seekers was 274,526 at the end of November,
which was 2,841 persons higher than in October. Compared to the same
month last year, the figure grew by 77,237 persons.

The newly registered job-seekers were 35,360 persons, which was 879
persons less than the previous months and 2,526 persons less from a year
ago.

In November, 32.3 percent job-seekers claimed unemployment benefits.

The number of vacancies totaled 317,972 by the end of November, up by
7,242 from the previous month, but 20,698 less than in November last
year.
