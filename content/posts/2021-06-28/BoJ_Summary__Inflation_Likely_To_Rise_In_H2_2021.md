Japan's inflation is likely to rise in the second half of 2021 as pent-
up demand starts materializing, Bank of Japan [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said at the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting held on June 17 and 18.

According to the summary of opinions, inflation is set to be around zero
percent in the short run.

Inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly on the back of
continued improvement in economic activity, a rise in energy prices, and
a dissipation of the effects of a reduction in mobile phone charges.

Nonetheless, inflationary pressure is expected be only transitory due to
an entrenched deflationary mindset.

As vaccinations have been progressing rapidly of late, Japan's
[economy][1] is expected to recover to a certain extent in the short
run, a member said.
