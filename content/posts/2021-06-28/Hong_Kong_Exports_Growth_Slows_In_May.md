Hong Kong's merchandise exports grew at a softer pace in May, data from
the Census and Statistics Department showed on Monday.

Exports rose 24.0 percent year-on-year in May, after a 24.4 percent
increase in April.

Imports gained 26.5 percent annually in May, following a 25.2 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit widened to HK$25.464 billion in May from HK$13.73
billion in the same month last year. In March, the deficit was HK$31.776
billion.

"Looking ahead, the further revival of demand from major economies
should augur well for Hong Kong's export performance in the near term,"
a government spokesman said.

"Yet, developments of the global pandemic and China-US relations, as
well as heightened geopolitical tensions, still warrant attention,"
spokesman added.
