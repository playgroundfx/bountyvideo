Austria's manufacturing sector registered another record growth in June
amid increase in new orders as demand continued to recover from the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, survey results from IHS Markit showed
on Monday.

The headline UniCredit Bank Austria Manufacturing Purchasing Managers'
Index rose to 67.0 in June from 66.4 in May. A score above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

New order growth hit a fresh record high in June on robust demand from
both domestic and foreign [markets][1]. At the same time, the rate of
output growth remained elevated by [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) standards but eased from
May's record high to a four-month low.

On the price front, the survey revealed that the rate of input price
inflation quickened to a new all-time high in June and average factory
gate charges increased at a record rate.

Overall expectations remained strongly positive by [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) standards,
and even improved slightly since May.

Strong optimism towards the outlook, combined with efforts to expand
capacity to meet demand, led to a steep rise in factory employment in
June, the survey showed.
