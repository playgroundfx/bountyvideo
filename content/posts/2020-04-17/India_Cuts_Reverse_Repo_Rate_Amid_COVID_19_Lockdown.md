India's central bank reduced its reverse repo rate, while retaining the
key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and ramped up liquidity measures as economic activity
came to a standstill amid nation undergoing a strict lockdown to curb
the spread of [coronavirus][1], or COVID-19.

The Reserve Bank of India lowered its reverse repo rate by 25 basis
points to 3.75 percent from 4.00 percent, Governor Shaktikanta Das said
in an unscheduled press conference on Friday.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate remained unchanged at 4.40 percent. This move would
discourage banks from parking excess funds with the central bank and
instead lend to the [economy][2].

The central bank had earlier cut its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate by 75 basis points and
reverse repo rate by 90 basis points in March.

Further, the bank decided to conduct targeted long-term repo operations,
or TLTRO, for an aggregate amount of INR 500 billion.

In order to conserve capital, the central bank instructed banks to avoid
dividend payouts.

The liquidity coverage ratio for banks was reduced to 80 percent from
100 percent, with immediate effect. This requirement will be gradually
restored back in two phases.

With an aim to meet long-term funding needs of the agriculture and rural
sectors and small industries along with housing, the RBI will provide
INR 500 billion to financial institutions.

The apex bank raised the ways and means advances limit of states by 60
percent so as to help the state governments to undertake COVID-19
containment and mitigation efforts.

The central bank also left the door open for further loosening, although
without more help from the Finance Ministry, the situation is likely to
get significantly worse, Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

The announcement was, however, a disappointment for the [markets][3],
which expected aggressive easing via unconventional routes such as debt
purchases, as well as monetization of the fiscal deficit, Prakash
Sakpal, an ING economist said.

Sakpal said he does not consider economic stimulus as strong enough to
position the economy for a speedy recovery once the pandemic ends.

In March, consumer price inflation eased to 5.9 percent from 6.6 percent
in February.

Governor said inflation could recede even further, barring supply
disruption shocks and may even settle well below the target of 4 percent
by the second half of 2020-21.
