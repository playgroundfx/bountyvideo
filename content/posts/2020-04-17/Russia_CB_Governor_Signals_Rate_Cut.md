Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina signaled an interest rate
reduction at the next board meeting in April.

"As always, we will consider a range of different economic scenarios
and, taking these into account, we will evaluate what space is available
for easing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and what steps we should take," Nabiullina
said Friday.

At the March meeting, the bank had retained its key rate at 6.00 percent
after lowering it by a quarter point in February.

The governor noted that inflation at 2.9 percent is still below the
target.
