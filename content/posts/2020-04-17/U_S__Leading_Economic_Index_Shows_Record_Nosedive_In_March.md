A report released by the Conference Board on Friday showed its index of
leading U.S. economic indicators registered the largest decline in its
60-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in the month of March.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index plunged by 6.7
percent in March after dipping by a revised 0.2 percent in February.

Economists had expected the index to plummet by 7.0 percent compared to
the 0.1 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month.

"The unprecedented and sudden deterioration was broad based, with the
largest negative contributions coming from initial claims for
unemployment insurance and stock prices," said Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior
Director of Economic Research at The Conference Board.

He added, "The sharp drop in the LEI reflects the sudden halting in
[business][1] activity as a result of the global pandemic and suggests
the US economy will be facing a very deep contraction."

The reported said the coincident economic index slumped by 0.9 percent
in March after rising by 0.3 percent in February, while the lagging
economic index tumbled by 1.2 percent following a 0.3 percent increase.
