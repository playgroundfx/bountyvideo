Europe car registrations recorded a dramatic drop as a result of the
COVID-19 outbreak, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or
ACEA, reported Friday.

Passenger car registrations declined 55.1 percent year-on-year to
567,308 units in March.

With containment/lockdown measures taking hold in most [markets][1] from
around the middle of the month, the vast majority of European
dealerships were closed during the second half of March, the ACEA said.

Among 27 EU markets, Italy logged showed the biggest decline of 85.4
percent. Demand collapsed in France, down 72.2 percent. Spain's car
sales declined 69.3 percent and Germany's sales slid 37.7 percent.

In the first quarter, demand in the EUR fell 25.6 percent from the same
period last year. Each of the major EU markets posted significant losses
so far in 2020.
