Estonia's trade balance swung to surplus in September as exports rose
and imports declined, figures from Statistics Estonia showed on Monday.

The trade balance registered a surplus of EUR 4 million in September
versus a deficit of EUR 169 million in the same month last year. In
August, the trade deficit was EUR 117 million.

Exports rose 11.0 year-on-year in September, after a 6.0 percent decline
in August.

Imports decreased 4.0 percent yearly in September, same as seen in the
previous month.

In the third quarter, the trade deficit decreased to EUR 238 million
from EUR 468 million in the last year.

Exports rose 1.0 percent yearly in the third quarter and imports fell
5.0 percent.

"In September, export turnover was the highest of this year, which had a
positive impact on the whole quarter," Evelin Puura, an analyst at
Statistics Estonia, said.

"The main contributors to the growth in exports were electronics
industry with communications equipment and agricultural sector with
dispatches of cereals," Puura added.
