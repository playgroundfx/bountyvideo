Germany's exports expanded more than expected in September, while
imports dropped marginally, data from Destatis revealed on Monday.

Exports increased 2.3 percent month-on-month, faster than the
economists' forecast of 2 percent but slower than the 2.9 percent growth
logged in August.

Meanwhile, imports dropped 0.1 percent, confounding expectations for an
increase of 2.1 percent. Imports were up 5.8 percent in August.

As a result, the trade surplus advanced to a seasonally adjusted EUR
17.8 billion from EUR 15.4 billion posted in August. The expected
surplus was EUR 15.8 billion.

On a yearly basis, exports decreased at a slower pace of 3.8 percent,
following a 10.2 percent drop seen in August. Likewise, imports were
down 4.3 percent versus a 6.8 percent fall in the prior month.

The trade surplus totaled an unadjusted EUR 20.8 billion, which was
smaller the EUR 21.2 billion surplus posted in September 2019.

The current account of the balance of payments showed a surplus of EUR
26.3 billion compared to EUR 23.5 billion in the same period last year.

Exports to China increased by 10.6 percent from last year, while
shipments to the United States, which have been hit particularly hard by
the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, dropped by 5.8 percent.

Exports to the United Kingdom showed an annual decrease of 12.4 percent.

In September, most imports came to Germany from China. Goods to the
value of EUR 9.7 billion were imported from there, which means that
imports from China were up 3.0 percent from September 2019.

Imports from the United States also rose by 3.0 percent but imports from
the United Kingdom fell 14.7 percent.

Looking ahead, exports (and industrial production) could still prevent
the [economy][2] from falling into a second lockdown depression in the
final quarter of the year, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said.

Even if the longer-term outlook has improved somewhat, the German export
sector will not return to its old strength easily, the economist added.
