Indonesia's consumer confidence weakened in October, though households'
expectations for the next six months remained quite optimistic on hopes
of more income and job availability, survey data from Bank Indonesia
showed on Monday.

The consumer confidence index fell to 79.0 from 83.4 in September, the
bank said.

The consumer expectation index remained above the 100-point threshold at
106.6. This signaled that consumer expectations of economic conditions
in the next six months was quite optimistic, underpinned by upbeat
sentiment regarding the income and employment outlook.

However, consumers were less upbeat regarding the current economic
situation due to lower income and less job availability amid the
[coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic.
