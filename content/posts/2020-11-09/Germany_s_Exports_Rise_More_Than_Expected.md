Germany's exports grew more than expected in September, while imports
fell unexpectedly, data from Destatis revealed on Monday.

Exports increased 2.3 percent month-on-month, faster than the
economists' forecast of 2 percent but slower than the 2.9 percent growth
logged in August.

Meanwhile, imports dropped 0.1 percent, confounding expectations for an
increase of 2.1 percent. Imports were up 5.8 percent in August.

As a result, the trade surplus advanced to a seasonally adjusted EUR
17.8 billion from EUR 15.4 billion posted in August. The expected
surplus was EUR 15.8 billion.

On a yearly basis, exports decreased at a slower pace of 3.8 percent,
following a 10.2 percent drop seen in August. Likewise, imports were
down 4.3 percent versus a 6.8 percent fall in the prior month.

The trade surplus totaled an unadjusted EUR 20.8 billion, which was
smaller the EUR 21.2 billion surplus posted in September 2019.

The current account of the balance of payments showed a surplus of EUR
26.3 billion compared to EUR 23.5 billion in the same period last year.
