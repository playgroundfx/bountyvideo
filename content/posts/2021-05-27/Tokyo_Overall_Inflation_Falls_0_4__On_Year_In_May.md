following the 0.6 percent decline in April.

Core CPI was down an annual 0.2 percent - unchanged and in line with
expectations.

Individually, prices were down for food, fuel, medical care and
transportation; prices were higher for housing, furniture, clothing,
education and recreation.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall inflation and core CPI
were both higher by 0.3 percent.
