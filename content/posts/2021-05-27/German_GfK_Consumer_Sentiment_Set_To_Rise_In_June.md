German consumer confidence is set to improve in June underpinned by
robust economic expectations, survey results from the market research
group GfK showed on Thursday.

The forward-looking consumer confidence index rose to -7.0 in June from
revised -8.6 in May. Nonetheless, the reading was weaker than the
economists' forecast of -5.2.

Rolf Bürkl, GfK consumer expert, said "We are leaving the third wave
behind us more and more, the incidences have been falling significantly
for several weeks."

"We are also making great strides in vaccination. As a result, openings
and a departure from strict lockdown are possible," Bürkl added.

The sudden rise in the economic outlook feeds hopes that - with a delay
- consumer sentiment will also benefit more in the second half of the
year and private consumption can recover, the market research group
said.

Currently, the German [economy][1] is being supported primarily by the
positive export development, especially in the trade in goods and
services with China and the USA.

Among three components of the consumer confidence index, economic
expectations surged in May and income expectations rose moderately.
Meanwhile, the propensity to buy declined from April.

After a plus of almost 34 points, the economic expectations indicator
jumped to 41.1 points in May, the highest value in more than three
years.

The income expectations indicator rose 10.2 points to 19.5 points in
May. Compared to last year, the score was up by 25 points.

After three increases in a row, the propensity to buy indicator dropped
7.3 points to 10.0. Despite the openings and relaxations that have been
made or announced so far, a number of consumption [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), especially in
the service sector, are not possible or only possible to a very limited
extent, the survey showed.
