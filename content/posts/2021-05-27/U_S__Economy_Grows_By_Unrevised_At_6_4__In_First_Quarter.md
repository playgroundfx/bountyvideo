The Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing the pace
of U.S. economic growth in the first quarter was unrevised from the
advance estimate.

The report showed real gross domestic product spiked by 6.4 percent in
the first quarter, unchanged from the estimate provided last month.
Economists had expected a modest upward revision in the pace of GDP
growth to 6.5 percent.

Upward revisions to consumer spending and non-residential fixed
investment were offset by downward revisions to exports and private
inventory investment, the Commerce Department said.

The strong GDP growth in the first three months of 2021 still reflects a
notable acceleration from the 4.3 percent jump seen in the last three
months of 2020.

Increases in consumer spending, non-residential fixed investment,
federal government spending, residential fixed investment, and state and
local government spending contributed to the first quarter GDP growth.

Meanwhile, decreases in private inventory investment and exports limited
the upside along with an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in
the calculation of GDP.

"We expect second-quarter GDP growth to be around 10% annualized, but
this is principally because of the strong momentum going into the
quarter generated by the delivery of the stimulus checks in the first
quarter," said Paul Ashworth, Chief US Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "Furthermore, given the growing shortages, supply constraints
mean that the balance of risks to that second-quarter forecasts probably
now lie to the downside."

The report also showed core consumer prices, which exclude food and
energy prices, surged up by 2.5 percent in the first quarter, reflecting
an upward revision from the previously reported 2.3 percent jump.
