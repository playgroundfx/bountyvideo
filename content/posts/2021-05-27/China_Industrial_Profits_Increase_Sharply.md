China's industrial profits logged a sharp increase in January to April
period, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed on
Thursday.

Industrial profits increased by 106 percent in January to April period
from the same period last year.

In April, industrial profits were up 57 percent annually. However, this
was much slower than the 92.3 percent expansion seen in March. This
slowdown was largely caused by rising commodity prices.

Data released last month showed that growth momentum in China's
manufacturing sector picked up in April with firms reporting the
strongest increases in output and sales for four months. The factory
Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.9 in April from 50.6 in March.
