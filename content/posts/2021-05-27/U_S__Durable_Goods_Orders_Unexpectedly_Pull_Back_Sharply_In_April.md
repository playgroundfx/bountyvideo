Reflecting a steep drop in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing an unexpected
decrease in new orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods in the month
of April.

The report showed durable goods orders tumbled by 1.3 percent in April
after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.3 percent in March.

The pullback surprised economists, who had expected durable goods orders
to climb by 0.7 percent compared to the 0.8 percent increase that had
been reported for the previous month.

The unexpected decrease in durable goods orders came as volatile orders
for transportation equipment plunged by 6.7 percent in April after
slumping 3.1 percent in March.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts led the way lower, plummeting by 6.2
percent due to the impact of semiconductor shortages.

Excluding the steep drop in orders for transportation equipment,
however, durable goods orders shot up by 1.0 percent in April after
spiking by 3.2 percent in March. Economists had expected 0.8 percent
growth.

Notable increases in orders for primary metals, machinery, and
fabricated metal products more than offset a decrease in orders for
electrical equipment, which may also be semiconductor-related.

The report also showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding
aircraft, a key indicator of [business][1] spending, surged up by 2.3
percent in April after jumping by 1.6 percent in March.

Shipments in the same category, which is the source data for equipment
investment in GDP, also increased by 0.9 percent in April after shooting
up by 1.6 percent in the previous month.

"Despite the disappointing decline in headline orders, this report
suggests the outlook for second-quarter business equipment investment is
arguably even more positive than we previously anticipated," said Paul
Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.
