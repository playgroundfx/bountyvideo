Japan will on Friday release April figures for unemployment,
highlighting a light day for Asia-Pacific economic activity.

The jobless rate is tipped to rise to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in
March, while the jobs-to-applicant ratio is called steady at 1.10.

Japan also will see May results for Tokyo inflation, which is considered
a leading indicator for the nationwide trend. In April, Tokyo overall
inflation was down 0.6 percent on year and core CPI dipped 0.2 percent.

Singapore will provide April figures for import and export prices, as
well as producer prices. In March, import prices were up 8.3 percent on
year and export prices gained an annual 3.5 percent, while producer
prices jumped 9.6 percent on year.
