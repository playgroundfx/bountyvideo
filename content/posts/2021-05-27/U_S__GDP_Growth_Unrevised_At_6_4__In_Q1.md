The Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing the pace
of U.S. economic growth in the first quarter was unrevised from the
advance estimate.

The report showed real gross domestic product spiked by 6.4 percent in
the first quarter, unchanged from the estimate provided last month.
Economists had expected a modest upward revision in the pace of GDP
growth to 6.5 percent.

Upward revisions to consumer spending and non-residential fixed
investment were offset by downward revisions to exports and private
inventory investment, the Commerce Department said.
