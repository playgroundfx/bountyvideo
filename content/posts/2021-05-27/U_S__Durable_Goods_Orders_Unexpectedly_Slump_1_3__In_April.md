Reflecting a steep drop in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing an unexpected
decrease in new orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods in the month
of April.

The report showed durable goods orders tumbled by 1.3 percent in April
after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.3 percent in March.

The pullback surprised economists, who had expected durable goods orders
to climb by 0.7 percent compared to the 0.8 percent increase that had
been reported for the previous month.

Excluding a 6.7 percent slump in orders for transportation equipment,
however, durable goods orders shot up by 1.0 percent in April after
spiking by 3.2 percent in March. Economists had expected 0.8 percent
growth.
