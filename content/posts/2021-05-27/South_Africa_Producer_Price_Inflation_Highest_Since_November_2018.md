South Africa's producer price inflation rose to the highest level in
three-and-a-half years in April, figures from Statistics South Africa
showed on Thursday.

The producer price index rose 6.7 percent year-on-year in April,
following a 5.2 percent increase in March. Economists had expected
inflation to rise to 6.8 percent.

The latest producer price inflation was the highest since November 2018,
when prices rose 6.8 percent.

products, beverages and tobacco products, coke, petroleum, chemical,
rubber and plastic products, and metals, machinery, equipment and
computing equipment in April.

Producer prices for mining industry gained 10.8 percent annually in
April and prices for electricity and water increased 5.9 percent.

Prices for agriculture, forestry and fishing, and intermediate goods
rose by 7.1 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.7 percent in April.
