A report released by the National Association of Realtors on Thursday
showed pending home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly tumbled to their
lowest level in nearly a year in the month of April.

NAR said its pending home sales index plunged by 4.4 percent to 106.2 in
April after surging up by 1.7 percent to a downwardly revised 111.1 in
March.

The steep drop surprised economists, who had expected pending home sales
to increase by 0.8 percent compared to the 1.9 percent jump originally
reported for the previous month.

With the unexpected pullback, the pending home sales index slumped to
its lowest level since hitting 101.4 in May of 2020.

A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet
closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale.

"Contract signings are approaching pre-pandemic levels after the big
surge due to the lack of sufficient supply of affordable homes," said
Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "The upper-end market is still
moving sharply as inventory is more plentiful there."

Despite the monthly decrease, pending home sales in April were up by
51.7 percent compared to a year ago, when pandemic-related shutdowns
caused sales to slump to an all-time low.

The report showed pending home sales in the Northeast plummeted by 12.9
percent in April, while pending sales tumbled by 6.1 percent in the
South and slumped by 2.6 percent in the West.

Only the Midwest witnessed a month-over-month increase, with pending
home sales in the region spiking by 3.5 percent.

"Some buyers from the expensive cities in the West and Northeast, who
have the flexibility to move and work from anywhere, could be opting for
a larger-sized home at a lower price in the Midwest," Yun said, noting
the Midwest has the most affordable homes.

Looking ahead, Yun said he expects housing supply to improve as soon as
autumn, pointing to an increase in the comfortability of those listing
as well as a rise in sellers after the conclusion of the eviction
moratorium or as they exit forbearance.

On Tuesday, the Commerce Department released a separate report showing a
substantial decrease in new home sales in the month of April.

The report said new home sales slumped by 5.9 percent to an annual rate
of 863,000 in April after jumping by 7.4 percent to a significantly
downwardly revised rate of 917,000 in March.

Economists had expected new home sales to tumble by 7.0 percent to a
rate of 950,000 from the 1.021 million originally reported for the
previous month.
