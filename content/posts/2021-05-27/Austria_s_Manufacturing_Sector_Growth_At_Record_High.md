Austria's manufacturing sector grew at a record pace in May driven by
output and orders, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The UniCredit Bank manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a
new high of 66.4 from 64.7 in April. A score above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

Manufacturers reported record increases in both output and new orders in
May. The rate of job creation was the quickest since May 2018. Higher
employment has been recorded in every survey throughout 2021 so far.

Further, reports of delivery delays continued to rise in May, reaching a
new series-record high for the fourth month in a row.

Input price inflation rose to a new record high in April due to a severe
shortage of inputs. There was also a record increase in average prices
charged by Austrian manufacturers.

Firms' expectations towards future output remained positive but slipped
to a four-month low.
