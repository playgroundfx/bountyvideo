Hong Kong's merchandise exports grew at a softer pace in April, data
from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Thursday.

Exports rose 24.4 percent year-on-year in April, after a 26.4 percent
increase in March.

Imports gained 25.2 percent annually in April, following a 21.7 percent
increase in the previous month.

The trade deficit widened to HK$31.776 billion in April from HK$23.337
billion in the same month last year. In March, the deficit was HK$26.967
billion.

"Looking ahead, the sustained revival of the global [economy][1] should
continue to render support to Hong Kong's export performance in the near
term," a government spokesman said.

"Yet, the evolving pandemic situation, along with other risk factors
such as China-US relations and geopolitical tensions, still warrant
attention," spokesman added.
