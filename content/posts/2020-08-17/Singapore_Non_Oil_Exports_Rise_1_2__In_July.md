Non-oil exports in Singapore were up 1.2 percent on month in July,
Enterprise Singapore said on Monday - beating forecasts for an increase
of 0.4 percent and down from 1.4 percent in June.

On a yearly basis, non-oil exports climbed 6.0 percent - again beating
expectations for a gain of 4.3 percent but slowing from 13.9 percent in
the previous month.

Growth was mainly driven by non-monetary gold, specialized machinery,
pharmaceuticals and electronics, the stat bureau said.

Exports to the top 10 [markets][1] grew as a whole in July, although
exports to Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, China and the European Union
declined.
