Japan's [economy][1] contracted at the fastest pace on record in the
second quarter due to the restrictions imposed to rein in the spread of
the coronavirus, official data showed Monday.  
  
Gross domestic product contracted 7.8 percent in the second quarter,
which was the third consecutive decline, preliminary data from the
Cabinet Office revealed. This was also bigger than economists' forecast
of 7.6 percent fall and first quarter's 0.6 percent decrease.

On an annualized basis, GDP declined 27.8 percent versus an expected
fall of 27.2 percent. Output contracted the most since the records began
in 1955.

The record annualized contraction was largely driven by a 30.1 percent
fall in household spending and a 56 percent decrease in exports.
Government spending declined only 1 percent.

At the same time, [business][2] investment dropped 5.8 percent in the
second quarter.

Japan's economy will recover more rapidly than many other large advanced
economies, Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

That reflects its strong corporate balance sheets, generous credit
guarantee scheme and low reliance on tourism, the economist added.
