Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday unveiled an
additional $5.8 billion (S$8 billion) stimulus package, focusing on the
labor market and the worst hit sectors of the [economy][1] during the
coronavirus pandemic.  
  
Heng, who is also the finance minister, said the government is not
planning to draw on past reserves to fund the latest stimulus.

The city-state economy has undergone its worst quarterly performance on
record, by contracting 13.2 percent in the second quarter of 2020.

The government so far has unveiled about $72.98 billion (S$100 billion)
measures over four budgets to support the people and [business][2]
during the Covid-19 crisis.

"We designed our measures to give us flexibility for adjustments as the
crisis progresses," Heng said. "Some of these measures are ending soon."

In the latest package, the government has extended the Jobs Support
Scheme to retain and upskill workers and also launched Jobs Growth
Incentive to increase headcount of local workers.

Heng extended the grant given to unemployed Singaporeans until December
2020.

Aerospace, aviation, and tourism have been the hardest hit sectors. For
the aviation sector, Heng said he will allocate an additional $136.47
million (S$187 million) to extend the support measures in the Enhanced
Aviation Support Package up to March 2021.

The government also plans to create around 4,000 new jobs, including
permanent roles, in the healthcare sector alone.

Other measures include $233.53 million (S$320 million) in vouchers to
residents to support domestic tourism. Details of the programme will be
released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry next month.

Last week, citing weak performance of the domestic economy and
significant uncertainty over how the Covid-19 situation evolve in
quarters ahead, the government downgraded GDP growth forecast for this
year to "-7.0 to -5.0 percent" from "-7.0 to -4.0 percent".
