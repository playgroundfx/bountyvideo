The Czech Republic's producer prices declined at a softer pace in July,
figures from the Czech Statistical Office showed on Monday.

The industrial producer price index decreased 0.1 percent year-on-year
in July, following a 0.3 percent decline in June. Economists had
expected a 0.2 percent fall.

Prices for mining and quarrying declined 3.5 percent annually in July
and manufacturing cost fell 1.6 percent. Prices for energy and
intermediate goods fell by 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.

Meanwhile, prices for electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning grew
7.7 percent. Prices for water supply and food, beverages and tobacco,
rose by 6.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.1 percent in July, largely
due to a rise in prices for coke, refined petroleum products. This was
in line with economists' expectation.
