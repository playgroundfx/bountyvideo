As the [coronavirus][1] pandemic shattered tourism, exports and domestic
spending, Thailand's [economy][2] contracted the most since the Asian
financial crisis in 1998.

Gross domestic product fell 12.2 percent on a yearly basis in the second
quarter, after easing by revised 2 percent in the first quarter, data
from the National Economic and Social Development Council, or NESDC,
showed on Monday.

However, this was slower than the economists' forecast of -13.3 percent.

The economy previously registered double-digit contractions in the
second and third quarters of 1998, when GDP was down by 11.2 percent and
10.1 percent, respectively.  
  
On a quarterly basis, GDP declined 9.7 percent in the second quarter
versus a 2.5 percent drop in the preceding period. GDP was expected to
fall 11.4 percent.

The government lowered its full-year GDP forecast for 2020 to -7.3
percent to -7.8 percent compared to an earlier projection of a -5
percent to -6 percent.

The drop in Thai GDP last quarter was not as huge as some other
economies in the region, but Thailand's dependence on tourism will weigh
on the recovery in the quarters ahead and means the economic outlook is
still one of the worst in the region, Alex Holmes, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

On the expenditure side, data showed that private final consumption
expenditure declined 6.6 percent, while government spending grew 1.4
percent. Gross fixed capital formation decreased 8 percent.

For external demands, exports and imports of goods and services
decreased in the second quarter. Goods and services balance showed a
surplus of THB 123.6 billion.

On the production side, the agricultural sector fell 3.2 percent, due
mainly to drought conditions.

The non-agricultural sector declined by 12.9 percent, deepening from a
fall of 1.3 percent in the first quarter.

Largely due to the decreased number of foreign tourists, together with
prevention and control the spread of Covid-19 measure, services output
plunged 12.3 percent. Manufacturing shrank 14.4 percent.

On the other hand, construction rebounded strongly in the second
quarter, with output expanding 7.4 percent.
