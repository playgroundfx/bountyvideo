The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on August 5, highlighting a light day for
Asia-Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, Australia's central bank left its benchmark lending rate
unchanged at the record low 0.25 percent and also kept its quantitative
easing unchanged. The bank vowed to maintain accommodative approach as
long as it is required.

Indonesia will see Q2 results for its Business Tendency Index; in the
previous three months, the index score was 104.82.
