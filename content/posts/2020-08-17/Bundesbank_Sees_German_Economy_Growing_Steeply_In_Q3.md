Germany's [economy][1] is set to grow at a sharp rate in the third
quarter, after a record fall in the second quarter due to the impact of
the coronavirus containment measures, but activity levels are likely to
remain well below the pre-crisis level for some time more, Bundesbank
said in its monthly report on Monday.  
  
The economic recovery that began back in May after the first easing of
containment measures is expected to continue in the summer months, the
bank said citing its experts.

This recovery is being underpinned by the expansionary monetary and
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures, such as the economic stimulus package recently
adopted by the Federal Government.  
  
Gross domestic product decreased 10.1 percent quarter-on-quarter during
the three months to June. This was the biggest fall since the quarterly
series began in 1970, data from Destatis showed.  
  
Private consumption likely had a massive drop in the second quarter due
to temporary [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) restrictions and uncertainties especially in the
hotel and restaurant sector. Car purchases were also less and there was
a dramatic decline in expenditure on travel and other recreational
activities.  
  
Real retail sales especially sales of food beverages, and online and
mail order [business][2] thrived during the Covid-19 crisis.  
  
While there were sharp decline in employment and rapid growth in
joblessness, mainly due to massive reductions in working hours,"...
measured against the depth of the economic slump, these adjustments were
fairly modest," Bundesbank said.  
  
Widespread take-up of short-time work schemes had stabilized both
employment levels and incomes, the bank pointed out.
