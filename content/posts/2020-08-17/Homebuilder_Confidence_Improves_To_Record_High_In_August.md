Homebuilder confidence matched a record high in the month of August,
according to a report released by the National Association of Home
Builders on Monday.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index jumped to 78
in August after soaring to 72 in July. Economists had expected the index
to inch up to 73.

With the much bigger than expected increase, the housing market index
matched the record high set in December of 1998.

"The demand for new single-family homes continues to be strong, as low
interest rates and a focus on the importance of housing has stoked buyer
traffic to all-time highs as measured on the HMI," said NAHB Chairman
Chuck Fowke.

He added, "However, the V-shaped recovery for housing has produced a
staggering increase for lumber prices, which have more than doubled
since mid-April. Such cost increases could dampen momentum in the
housing market this fall, despite [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low interest rates."

The HMI index gauging current sales conditions rose six points to 84,
the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months
increased three points to 78 and the measure charting traffic of
prospective buyers posted an eight-point gain to reach its highest level
ever at 65.
