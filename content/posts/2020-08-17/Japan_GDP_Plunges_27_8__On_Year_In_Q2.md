Japan's gross domestic product plummeted an annualized 27.8 percent on
year in the second quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office said on Monday's
preliminary report.

That missed expectations for a decline of 27.2 percent following the 2.2
percent drop in the previous three months.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP sank 7.8 percent - again
missing forecasts for a fall of 7.6 percent following the 0.6 percent
slide in the three months prior.

Capital expenditure was down 1.5 percent on quarter, which beat
expectations for a fall of 4.2 percent following the 1.7 percent
increase in Q1.
