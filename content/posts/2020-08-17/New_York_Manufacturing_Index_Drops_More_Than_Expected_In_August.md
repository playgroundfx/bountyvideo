Signaling a slower pace of growth, the New York Federal Reserve released
a report on Monday showing a much bigger than expected decrease by its
index of regional manufacturing activity in the month of August.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index tumbled
to 3.7 in August from 17.2 in July, although a positive reading still
indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to dip to 15.0.

Looking ahead, firms remained optimistic that conditions would improve
over the next six months, though optimism fell for a second consecutive
month.
