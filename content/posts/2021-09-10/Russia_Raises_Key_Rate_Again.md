Russia's central bank raised its key interest rate further, citing
upside risks to inflation, and said it is ready to hike rates further in
future if needed.  
  
The Board of Directors decided to raise the key interest rate by 25
basis points to 6.75 percent, the Bank of Russia said in a statement on
Friday. Economists had expected a hike to 7.00 percent.  
  
The central bank has steadily raised the rate from 4.50 percent in
March, when the current sequence of hikes began.  
  
In the second quarter, the [economy][1] returned to its pre-pandemic
level, thus reaching a balanced growth path, the bank said.  
  
"The contribution of persistent factors to inflation remains
considerable on the back of faster growth in demand relative to output
expansion capacity," the bank said.  
  
"In this environment, given high inflation expectations, the balance of
risks for inflation is tilted to the upside."

The bank fears a sustained deviation of inflation from its 4 percent
target.  
  
"If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank
of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate rises at its
upcoming meetings," the central bank added.  
  
The bank expects annual inflation to begin to slow down in the fourth
quarter of this year and to ease 4.0-4.5 percent in 2022. Inflation is
expected to remain close to 4 percent further on.
