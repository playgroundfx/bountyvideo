French industrial production and manufacturing grew at slower rates in
July, preliminary data from the statistical office INSEE showed Friday.  
  
Industrial production grew 0.3 percent from June, when it increased 0.6
percent. Economists had forecast 0.4 percent gain. Production rose for a
second straight month.  
  
Manufacturing output rose 0.6 percent after a 1.0 percent increase in
June.  
Compared to February 2020, which is before the first Covid-19 lockdown
began, industrial production was 4.8 percent less and manufacturing
output remained 5.5 percent lower.  
  
In July, manufacturing growth was largely driven by further growth in
the production of transport equipment, food products and beverages, and
machinery and equipment.  
  
Output decreased in mining and quarrying, energy, water supply and in
other manufacturing. A sharp fall was registered in the manufacture of
coke and refined petroleum.  
  
Among the main industrial groupings, manufacture of capital and
intermediate goods increased, from the previous month, while the
production of consumer durables, non-durables, and energy decreased.

Meanwhile, the construction output grew 1.4 percent month-on-month in
July after a 1.9 percent fall in the previous month.
