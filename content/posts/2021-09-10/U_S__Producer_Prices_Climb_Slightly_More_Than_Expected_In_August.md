Producer prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected in
the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
climbed by 0.7 percent in August after jumping by 1.0 percent for two
straight months. Economists had expected producer prices to increase by
0.6 percent.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices rose by 0.3 percent in August following a 0.9 percent advance in
July. Core prices were expected to rise by 0.4 percent.
