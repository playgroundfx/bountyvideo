Producer prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected in
the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Friday.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
climbed by 0.7 percent in August after jumping by 1.0 percent for two
straight months. Economists had expected producer prices to increase by
0.6 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in producer prices was partly due to a
rebound in food prices, which spiked by 2.9 percent in August after
tumbling by 2.1 percent in July.

Prices for trade services also showed a notable increase, jumping by 1.5
percent in August after surging up by 1.7 percent in July.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices rose by 0.3 percent in August following a 0.9 percent advance in
July. Core prices were expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

The report showed a continue spike in prices for transportation and
warehousing services, which soared by 2.8 percent in August after
shooting up by 2.7 percent in July.

With another monthly increase, the annual rate of growth in producer
prices accelerated to 8.3 percent in August from 7.8 percent in July,
reflecting the largest advance since 12-month data were first calculated
in November 2010.

The annual rate of growth in core producer prices also ticked up to 6.3
percent in August from 6.1 percent in July, showing the largest year-
over-year increase since data were first calculated in August 2014.

"While last month's increase in producer prices was slower than the
prior two months, the latest gain drove headline and core PPI inflation
to fresh record highs," Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics.

"However, price pressures continue to be driven by virus-sensitive
sectors that will improve as supply and demand patterns normalize
further," he added. "Still, the ongoing supply disruptions will keep
producer prices sticky."

Next Tuesday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on consumer price inflation in the month of August.
