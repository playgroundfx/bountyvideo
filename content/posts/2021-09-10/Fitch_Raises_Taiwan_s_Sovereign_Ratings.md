Fitch Ratings raised the sovereign ratings of Taiwan citing strong
economic growth, improvement in the external sector and continued fiscal
prudence.

The rating agency lifted the sovereign ratings to 'AA' from 'AA-'. The
outlook on the ratings was 'stable'.

The [economy][1] is projected to grow 3.3 percent in 2022, before
moderating to 2.6 percent in 2023.

According to Fitch, the current account surplus will widen to 14.8
percent of GDP in 2021 from 14.2 percent in 2020, driven by strong
merchandise exports and a collapse in outbound tourism.

The agency said Taiwan has a record of prudent fiscal management. In
addition, the economy's resilience during the pandemic has enabled the
authorities to be modest in their use of fiscal stimulus, underscored by
a general government deficit of just 1 percent in 2020.

The general government deficit is forecast to narrow to 0.7 percent in
2022 on continued revenue growth and a gradual unwinding of pandemic-
related spending.

In the press release, Fitch referred Taiwan as a part of China in some
places. The press release title said "Fitch Upgrades Taiwan, China to
'AA'."

Later, media reports said that the Taiwan government expressed sharp
disapproval of Fitch's action for calling the island a part of China.
