Eurozone consumer confidence deteriorated further in February, defying
expectations for a modest improvement, preliminary data from the
European Commission showed Friday.

The flash consumer confidence index fell to -8.8 from -8.5 in January.
Economists had expected a score of -8.0.  
  
The index fell for the fifth month in a row and the latest reading was
the weakest since March 2021, when it was -10.9.

The corresponding indicator for the EU dropped to -10.2 from -10.0 in
the previous month.

The indicator for both regions is now converging to its long-term
average, the commission said.

The survey data was collected from February 1 to 17.

The final figures are set to be released along with the monthly economic
sentiment survey data on February 25.
