UK retail sales rebounded at a faster than expected pace in January as
the disruption caused by the Omicron variant faded, the Office for
National Statistics said on Friday.

Retail sales volume grew 1.9 percent month-on-month, the fastest growth
since April 2021 and also bigger than the expected rate of 1.0 percent.

The monthly growth followed a revised 4 percent decline in December,
when earlier Christmas trading than normal in October and November, and
reduced retail footfall in December, linked to concerns around the
Omicron variant of [coronavirus][1], affected sales.

Sales volumes were 3.6 percent above their pre-coronavirus February 2020
levels.

Excluding auto fuel, retail sales volume increased 1.7 percent in
January after easing 3.9 percent in the previous month. Sales were
forecast to climb 1.2 percent.

Non-food store sales gained 3.4 percent with strong growth in household
goods stores, such as furniture stores and electrical goods stores and
department stores.

Meanwhile, food store sales dropped 2.3 percent from the prior month. At
the same time, automotive fuel sales were up 4.1 percent.

On a yearly basis, overall retail sales advanced 9.1 percent, reversing
a 1.7 percent fall in December and faster than the economists' forecast
of +8.7 percent.

Similarly, excluding auto, sales grew 7.2 percent after falling 3.8
percent in the prior month. Sales were forecast to gain 7.9 percent.

It is encouraging that the consumer recovery was well underway in
January, Adam Hoyes, an economist at Capital Economics, said. But with
real wages already falling and set to decline throughout 2022, the
outlook for consumer spending is hardly rosy.
