After reporting much weaker than expected U.S. retail sales growth in
the previous month, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday
showing retail sales jumped by much more than expected in the month of
September.

The Commerce Department said retail sales spiked by 1.9 percent in
September after rising by 0.6 percent in August. Economists had expected
retail sales to climb by 0.7 percent.

Excluding an increase in sales by motor vehicles and parts dealers,
retail sales still surged up by 1.5 percent in September after climbing
by a downwardly revised 0.5 percent in August.

Ex-auto sales were expected to rise by 0.5 percent compared to the 0.7
percent increase originally reported for the previous month.
