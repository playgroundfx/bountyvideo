Eurozone consumer prices declined for the second straight month in
September, as initially estimated, final data from Eurostat revealed
Friday.

Consumer prices decreased 0.3 percent on a yearly basis, following a 0.2
percent drop in August. The statistical office confirmed the flash
estimate released on October 2. A similar lower rate was last seen in
April 2016.

The European Central Bank aims to keep inflation "below, but close to 2
percent." But the bank expects inflation to average 1 percent in 2021
and 1.3 percent in 2022.

Month-on-month, the harmonized index of consumer prices gained 0.1
percent in September, in line with the preliminary estimate.

Core inflation that excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco,
halved to a record 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent in August. The core rate
also matched the flash estimate.
