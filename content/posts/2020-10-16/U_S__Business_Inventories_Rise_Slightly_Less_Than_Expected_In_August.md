Business inventories in the U.S. increased by slightly less than
expected in the month of August, according to a report released by the
Commerce Department of Friday.

The Commerce Department said [business][1] inventories rose by 0.3
percent in August after inching up by 0.1 percent in July. Economists
had expected inventories to climb by 0.4 percent.

The increase in business inventories came as wholesale and retail
inventories both grew by 0.4 percent, while manufacturing inventories
came in unchanged line.

The report also said business sales climbed by 0.6 percent in August
following a 3.4 percent spike in the previous month.

Wholesale sales jumped by 1.4 percent during the month, while
manufacturing and retail sales crept up by 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent,
respectively.

With sales increasing by more than inventories, the total business
inventories/sales ratio edged down to 1.32 in August from 1.33 in July.
