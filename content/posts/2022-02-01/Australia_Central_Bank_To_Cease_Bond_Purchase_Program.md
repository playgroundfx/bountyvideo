Australia's central bank decided to discontinue the bond purchase
programme and left its key rate unchanged on Tuesday.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to cease the further purchases under the bond
purchase program, with the final purchases to take place on February 10.

The board also decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a record low
of 0.10 percent.

Lowe said faster-than-expected progress has been made towards the RBA's
goals and further progress is likely. In these circumstances, the board
judged that now was the right time to end the bond purchase program.

Further, the governor said ceasing purchases under the bond purchase
program does not imply a near-term increase in interest rates.  
  
He added that the bank will not increase the cash rate until actual
inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. While
inflation has picked up, it is too early to conclude that it is
sustainably within the target band.
