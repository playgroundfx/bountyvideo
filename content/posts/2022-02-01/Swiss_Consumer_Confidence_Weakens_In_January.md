Switzerland's consumer confidence weakened in the backdrop of less
positive economic outlook and rising inflationary pressures, results of
a quarterly survey by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs or SECO
showed Tuesday.  
  
The consumer confidence index eased to -3.6 in the January survey from
+3.5 in the previous round. The reading fell back into negative
territory after two positive quarters.  
  
The index reflecting households' economic expectations over the next 12
months dropped sharply to 21.0 from 43.4.  
  
However, the reading remains clearly above the long-term average of -9.0
suggesting that respondents continue to expect the economic recovery to
sustain.  
  
Households viewed the labor market situation as favorable as the
relevant sub-index climbed to -59, returning to the long-term average
for the first time since the pandemic. Unemployment figures are also
expected to improved over the next 12 months.

Consumers' financial expectations for the next 12 months weakened with
the corresponding index falling to -3.2 from -0.8. Their assessment of
the past financial situation also weakened.  
  
"This assessment is probably due in particular to higher consumer
prices, which are reducing the purchasing power of Swiss households,"
SECO said.  
  
Swiss consumers were more pessimistic regarding making big purchases,
mostly due to rising price pressures. The corresponding index fell to
-22.7 from -18.5.
