Australia's central bank decided to scrap its bond purchase programme
citing faster-than-expected improvement towards the inflation goal and
strengthening labor market conditions.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to cease the further purchases under the bond
purchase program, with the final purchases to take place on February 10.

The board will consider the issue of the reinvestment of the proceeds of
future bond maturities at its meeting in May.

The board also decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a record low
of 0.10 percent.

Lowe said the faster-than-expected progress has been made towards the
RBA's goals and further progress is likely. In these circumstances, the
board judged that now was the right time to end the bond purchase
program.

Further, the governor said ceasing purchases under the bond purchase
program does not imply a near-term increase in interest rates.

He repeated that the bank will not increase the cash rate until actual
inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. While
inflation has picked up, it is too early to conclude that it is
sustainably within the target band.

The bank lifted its inflation forecast amid higher petrol prices and the
disruptions to global supply chains.

Underlying inflation is expected to increase further in coming quarters
to around 3.25 percent, before declining to around 2.75 percent over
2023 as the supply-side problems are resolved and consumption patterns
normalize.

Although the Omicron outbreak has not derailed the economic recovery,
the bank lowered its growth projections. The forecast for GDP growth for
2022 was downgraded to 4.25 percent from 5.5 percent and for 2023 to 2.0
percent from 2.5 percent.

The RBA forecast the unemployment rate to fall below 4 percent later in
the year and to be around 3.75 percent at the end of 2023.

A further pick-up in wages growth is expected as the labor market
tightens, the bank said. This pick-up is still expected to be only
gradual, although there is uncertainty about the behavior of wages at
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low levels of unemployment.
