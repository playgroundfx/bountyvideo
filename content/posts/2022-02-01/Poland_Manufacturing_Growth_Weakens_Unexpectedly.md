Poland's manufacturing sector growth unexpectedly weakened in January,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, fell to 54.5 in
January from 56.1 in December.

Economists had forecast a score of 56.4. A PMI reading above 50 suggests
growth in the manufacturing sector.

Both output and new order growth eased in January. Export orders rose
modestly and average lead time for delivery declined.

Input purchases rose for the tenth straight month in January and
purchasing activity grew for the fourteenth month in a row.

Staffing level increased in January, with the rate of growth highest in
six months. Outstanding works rose for the sixteenth month in a row.

Confidence regarding the 12-month outlook remained positive, but dropped
to its lowest for fourteen months.

Average operating costs rose at an elevated rate that was the strongest
since mid-2021. Output charges increased at the sharpest rate for three
months.

"Poland's manufacturing sector extended its current run of expansion at
the start of 2022, but the specters of 2021 - supply-side constraints
and prices pressures - persisted," Paul Smith, economics director at IHS
Markit, said.
