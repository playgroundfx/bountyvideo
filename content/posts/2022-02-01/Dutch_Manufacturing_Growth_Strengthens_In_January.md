The Dutch manufacturing sector growth improved in January, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The Nevi Netherlands manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to
60.1 in January from 58.7 in December. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

Output increased in January and backlogs of work rose for the fourteenth
straight month.

New orders rose for the eighteenth month in a row in January and new
export [business][1] increased at a faster rate.

Stocks of finished goods remained stable in January, while output
expectation rose to the highest in four months.

The number of workforce expanded at the fastest rate in three months and
input delivery time lengthened.

Input prices rose sharply in January. The rate of input price inflation
eased to the lowest in eleven months and output prices increased
sharply, albeit at the slowest rate since August last year.

"So far, supply chains do not seem to be disrupted even further by the
rapid spread of omicron and the quarantine measures designed to curb the
novel strain," Albert Jan Swart, manufacturing sector economist at ABN
AMRO, said.
