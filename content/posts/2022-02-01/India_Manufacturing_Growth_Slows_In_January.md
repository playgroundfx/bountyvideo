India's manufacturing sector growth eased in January, survey results
from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.0 in January
from 55.5 in December. A score above 50.0 indicates expansion.

"The latest PMI results indicated that the new wave of COVID-19 had a
mild impact on the performance of the Indian manufacturing sector,"
Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.

Factory orders rose at the slowest rate in four months and international
sales increased at a weaker pace.

The overall sentiment dampened due to pandemic-related uncertainty and
inflation expectations, and the [business][1] confidence slipped to the
lowest in over one-and-a-half years.

The number of workforce declined in January, while input inventories
increased, with the rate of expansion being the lowest in five months.

Input costs increased substantially in January, but the overall rate of
inflation eased to the lowest in four months. Output prices rose at a
quicker rate.

Stocks of finished goods declined further in January and average lead
times lengthened moderately.
