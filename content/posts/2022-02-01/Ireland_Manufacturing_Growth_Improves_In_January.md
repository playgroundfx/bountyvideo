Ireland's manufacturing growth improved in January, data from IHS Markit
showed on Tuesday.

The factory Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 59.4 in January from 58.3
in December.

This was the highest reading since April 2021. Any reading above 50.0
indicates expansion in the sector.

Demand for manufacturing goods rose for the eleventh straight month in
January and export orders increased.

New [business][1] inflow accelerated in January and production increased
for the eleventh month in a row, albeit at the weakest rate since March.

Output growth eased in January and inventories of finished goods fell
for the seventh straight month.

Backlogs of work rose further in January and the number of workforce
increased. Input lead time lengthened to a greater extend.

Both the input and output prices increased at the slowest rate since
August last year, albeit remaining among the highest on record.

"Manufacturers were very positive on the 12-month outlook for
production, with the recovery from the pandemic expected to continue in
2022 and new business growing," Oliver Mangan, AIB chief economist,
said.
