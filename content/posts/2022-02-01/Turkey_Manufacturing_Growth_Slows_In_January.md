Turkey's manufacturing activity grew at a softer pace in January, survey
results from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The headline Istanbul Chamber of Industry Turkey manufacturing
Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 50.5 in January from 52.1 in
December. Any reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

Inflationary pressures increased in January due to weakness of the
Turkish lira. Input costs rose at the steepest pace and output price
inflation eased.

Total new orders moderated for the fourth straight month in January and
new export orders eased ending a seven-month sequence of growth.

Firms reduced their production and purchasing activity for the second
straight month. Backlogs of work declined further.

Employment increased in each of the past twenty months in January,
albeit the rate of job creation was the softest in this sequence.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in January.

"There were, however, some signs of pressures beginning to ease,
something which firms will hope continues over the rest of the first
quarter to help them in the hunt for new [business][1]," Andrew Harker,
economics director at IHS Markit, said.
