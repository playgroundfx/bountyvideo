The total value of retail sales in Australia was down a seasonally
adjusted 4.4 percent on month in December, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said on Tuesday - coming in at A$31.926 billion.

That missed expectations for a flat reading following the 7.3 percent
jump in November.

Individually, food retailing rose 2.2 percent on month, while household
goods gained 9.2 percent, department store sales tumbled 21.3 percent
and food services fell 0.7 percent.

On a yearly basis, retail sales were up 4.8 percent.
