South Korea posted a merchandise trade deficit of $4.89 billion in
January, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.

That was shy of expectations for a shortfall of $4 billion following the
upwardly revised $0.45 billion deficit in December (originally $0.59
billion).

Exports were up 15.2 percent on year, missing forecasts for an increase
of 15.5 percent and down from 18.3 percent in the previous month.

Imports surged an annual 35.5 percent versus expectations for a gain of
32.8 percent following the downwardly revised 37.1 percent increase a
month earlier (originally 37.4 percent).
