Greece's manufacturing sector growth weakened in January, survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index declined to 57.9 in January
from 59.0 in December. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the
sector.

Production increased further in January, though the pace of growth was
the softest for nine months. New order growth was the slowest since
April last year and new export orders was the weakest since July.

The rate of job creation was the sharpest on record and backlogs of work
decreased.

The pace of cost inflation increased and remained substantial in
January. Selling prices increased at a steepest pace.

Input buying expanded at the softest pace since March 2020.

Business confidence remained strong in January, with the hopes of
further rise in client demand.

"January data indicated a loss of growth momentum across the Greek
manufacturing sector," Sian Jones, senior economist at IHS Markit, said.
