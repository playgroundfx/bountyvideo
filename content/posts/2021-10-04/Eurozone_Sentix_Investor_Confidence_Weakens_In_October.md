Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence weakened for the third straight month in
October, survey data from the behavioral research institute Sentix
showed on Monday.

The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index dropped more-than-expected to 16.9 in
October from 19.6 in September. The expected level was 18.6. The latest
score was the lowest since April 2021.

Current assessment as well as expectations deteriorated in October. The
current situation index fell to 26.3 from 30.8 in the previous month.

Similarly, the expectations index came in at 8.0, down from 9.0 in the
prior month.

The economic recovery process continues to falter, Sentix said. The
continuing loss of momentum does not signal any autumn revival, which
typically sets in at this time of year.

The answer to the question of whether this is a trend reversal or just a
slowdown in growth remains open, the think tank said.

Sentix said it remains crucial that the expectations do not fall below
the zero line. For then a stronger slump in economic output would be
expected - a trend reversal would then be in the offing.

In Germany, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index dropped marginally to 20.0 in
October from 20.9 in September.

"For Germany, we get the first feedback after the Bundestag elections,"
the think tank said.

The current assessment slipped 5 points, while the expectations
component was bucking the global loss of momentum and even managed to
increase by 2.7 points, the survey showed.
