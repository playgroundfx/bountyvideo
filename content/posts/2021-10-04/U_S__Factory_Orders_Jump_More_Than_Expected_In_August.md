A report released by the Commerce Department on Monday showed new orders
for U.S. manufactured goods jumped by more than expected in the month of
August.

The Commerce Department said factory orders surged up by 1.2 percent in
August after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.7 percent in July.

Economists had expected factory orders to increase by 0.9 percent
compared to the 0.4 percent rise originally reported for the previous
month.

The report showed orders for durable goods shot up by 1.8 percent, while
orders for non-durable goods rose by 0.6 percent.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said shipments of manufactured goods
inched up by 0.1 percent in August after jumping by 1.5 percent in July.

Inventories of manufactured goods also climbed by 0.6 percent in August,
matching the increase seen in the previous month.

The inventories-to-shipments ratio was 1.47, unchanged from July.
