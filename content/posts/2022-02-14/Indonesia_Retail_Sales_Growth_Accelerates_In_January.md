Indonesia's retail sales growth accelerated further in January driven by
automotive fuels and clothing, data from Bank Indonesia showed on
Monday.

Retail sales were up 16.0 percent on a yearly basis, faster than the
13.8 percent rise in December and 10.8 percent increase in November.

On a monthly basis, retail sales were down 2.4 percent after a 7.6
percent growth in December.

Retailers expect mild inflationary pressure in March and June in
response to price corrections caused by adequate supply of goods and
services, coupled with the smooth and orderly distribution of goods.
