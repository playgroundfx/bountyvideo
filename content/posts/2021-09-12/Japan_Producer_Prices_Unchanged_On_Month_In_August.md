Producer prices in Japan were flat on month in August, the Bank of Japan
said on Monday - shy of expectations for an increase of 0.2 percent and
down from 1.1 percent in July.

On a yearly basis, producer prices gained 5.5 percent - beneath
forecasts for a gain of 5.6 percent, which would have been unchanged
from the previous month.

Export prices were down 0.2 percent on month and up 10.9 percent on
year, the bank said, while import prices rose 1.8 percent on month and
surged 29.2 percent on year.
