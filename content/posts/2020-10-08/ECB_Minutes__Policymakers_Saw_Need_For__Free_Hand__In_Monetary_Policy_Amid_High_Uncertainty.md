European Central Bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers saw the need for latitude in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to tackle the difficult economic situation as the outlook remains
highly uncertain in the absence of a permanent cure for the
[coronavirus][1] and political factors such as Brexit transition and US
presidential election, minutes of the September [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting showed on
Thursday.

"In the prevailing environment of high uncertainty, keeping a steady
hand with respect to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) was seen as most appropriate," the
minutes, which the ECB calls "account", of the September 9-10 Governing
Council meeting showed.

"At the same time, the case was made for keeping a "free hand" in view
of the elevated uncertainty, underpinning the need to carefully assess
all incoming information, including the euro exchange rate, and to
maintain flexibility in taking appropriate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action if and when
needed."

Rate-setters stressed that the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the ongoing
Brexit deal negotiations, US presidential election and fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
decisions of euro area member countries must be closely monitored.

The ECB hopes to reduce the pace of monthly asset purchases under its
Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme,or PEPP, as the tensions in
financial [markets][2] subside, to allow to build buffers against future
crises.

In the September [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session, the central bank left its key interest
rates and its PEPP unchanged, and reaffirmed its forward guidance.
