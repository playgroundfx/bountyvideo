A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a modest
decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended October 3rd.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims edged down to 840,000,
a decrease of 9,000 from the previous week's revised level of 849,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 820,000 from the
837,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The report said the less volatile four-week moving average also fell to
857,000, a decrease of 13,250 from the previous week's revised average
of 870,250.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also tumbled by 1.003 million to 10.976 million
in the week ended September 26th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims slumped to 12,112,250,
a decrease of 642,000 from the previous week's revised average of
12,754,250.

"Failure to pass additional fiscal relief measures will lead to more new
claims given the announcement of layoffs by many firms," said Nancy
Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics. "It also raises
the risk that some individuals will lose benefits altogether at the
start of 2021."

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing job
growth in the U.S. slowed by much more than expected in the month of
September.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 661,000
jobs in September after spiking by an upwardly revised 1.489 million
jobs in August.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 850,000 jobs compared
to the jump of 1.371 million jobs originally reported for the previous
month.
