Germany's producer prices increased in August at the fastest pace since
1974, data from Destatis revealed on Monday.  
  
Producer price inflation rose to 12 percent in August from 10.4 percent
in July. This was the biggest growth since December 1974, when prices
were up 12.4 percent amid the first oil crisis.

On a monthly basis, producer prices advanced 1.5 percent, but slower
than the 1.9 percent increase seen in July.

Excluding energy, producer prices grew 8.3 percent.  
  
The annual growth was largely driven by the 24 percent increase in
energy prices. Intermediate goods prices climbed 17.1 percent.

At the same time, prices of durable consumer goods gained 2.8 percent
and that of capital goods by 2.4 percent. Non-durable consumer goods
prices were up 2.1 percent.
