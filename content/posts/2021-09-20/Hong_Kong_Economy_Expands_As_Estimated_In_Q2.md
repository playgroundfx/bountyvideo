The Hong Kong [economy][1] grew as initially estimated in the second
quarter, the Census and Statistics Department said Monday.

Gross domestic product increased 7.6 percent in real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) in the second
quarter over a year earlier, compared with the 8.0 percent expansion in
the first quarter. The rate came in line with the estimate published on
August 13.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was down 0.9 percent in the second quarter, as
initially estimated, following first quarter's 5.5 percent increase.

The Hong Kong economy remained on track for recovery in the second
quarter alongside the improving global economic conditions and receding
local epidemic, the agency said.

Import and export trade continued to record visible growth and
consumption-related industries also improved further.

Yet the recovery remained uneven across industries, with consumption-
related economic activities still below their pre-recession levels, the
agency added.
