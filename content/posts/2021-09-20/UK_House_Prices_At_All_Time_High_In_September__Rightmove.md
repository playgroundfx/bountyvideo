The average price of property coming to the UK housing market hits a new
all-time high in September despite the traditional summer holiday lull,
data from property [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove showed on Monday.

The average asking price was GBP 338,462. Nonetheless, Rightmove said
this new record high was only GBP 15 higher than the previous record set
in July, a sign that prices are now stabilizing.

Fierce competition continued among buyers for the record low number of
available properties for sale. However, there were early signs of more
properties coming to market, which may help to slowly rebuild buyer
choice.

House prices increased 5.8 percent year-on-year in September after
rising 5.6 percent in August.

On a monthly basis, house prices gained 0.3 percent, offsetting a 0.3
percent drop in the prior month.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data said "This 14
percent increase in the number of new sellers coming to market in the
first half of September is only an early snapshot, but autumn is
traditionally a busy period, as those owners who have hesitated thus far
during the year see the few months before Christmas as an opportunity to
belatedly get their moving plans underway."
