Hong Kong's consumer price inflation eased in August, data from the
Census and Statistics Department showed on Monday.

The composite consumer price index rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in
August, after a 3.7 percent increase in July.

Excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, the
composite consumer price index increased 1.2 percent yearly in August,
following a 1.0 percent rise in the previous month.

"Looking ahead, while domestic and external price pressures may build up
further in the near term alongside the economic recovery, the underlying
inflation should remain largely moderate as the local [economy][1] is
still operating below capacity," a government spokesman said.
