China's consumer price inflation eased in June on falling food prices
and factory gate price growth slowed, driven by the leveling off in
global commodity prices, data from the National Bureau of Statistics
showed on Friday.

Consumer prices rose 1.1 percent year-on-year in June, slower than the
1.3 percent increase seen in May. The rate was forecast to remain
unchanged at 1.3 percent.

Core inflation that excludes food and energy prices, held steady at 0.9
percent in June.

Food prices declined 1.7 percent due to a 36.5 percent fall in pork
prices. Meanwhile, non-food prices advanced about 1.7 percent in June.

The plunge in pork prices is likely to be a drag on food inflation for a
while longer, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at
Capital Economics, said. This should keep headline inflation below 2
percent even if, core inflation gradually returns to more normal levels.

Concerns about price pressures in China look set to ease over the coming
months, with inflation likely to settle at a level that is unlikely to
trigger any shifts in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the economists said.

People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, said last month that consumer
price inflation is likely to remain below 2 percent in 2021, which is
below the government's target of around 3 percent.

Another report from the NBS showed that factory gate inflation came in
at 8.8 percent in June, in line with economists' expectations, and down
from 9 percent in May.

Nonetheless, producer price inflation remained at an elevated level.

Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS, said policies taken by
the government to ensure supply and stabilize commodity prices started
to show results. The supply-demand relation seems to improve and
industrial product price growth slowed down to a certain degree.
