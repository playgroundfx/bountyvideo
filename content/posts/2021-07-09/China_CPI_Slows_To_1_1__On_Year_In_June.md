Consumer prices in China were up 1.1 percent on year in June, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 1.3 percent, which would
have been unchanged from the May reading.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.4 percent - again missing
expectations for a flat reading following the 0.2 percent decline a
month earlier.

The bureau also said that producer prices were up 8.8 percent on year -
in line with expectations and slowing from 9.0 percent in the previous
month.
