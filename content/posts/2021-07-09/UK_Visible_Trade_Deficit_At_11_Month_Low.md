The UK visible trade deficit narrowed to an 11-month low in May, the
Office for National Statistics reported Friday.

The trade in goods resulted in a shortfall of GBP 8.48 billion in May
compared to a GBP 10.95 billion deficit in the previous month. This was
the lowest shortfall since June 2020 and also smaller than the expected
level of -GBP 11.1 billion.

Exports of goods grew at a faster pace of 7.1 percent in May, while
imports dropped 1.4 percent from the previous month.

At the same time, the surplus on services trade remained broadly
unchanged at GBP 9.4 billion in May, data showed.

As a result, the total balance showed a surplus of GBP 884 million
versus a deficit of GBP 1.59 billion in April.

The visible trade deficit with EU countries declined to GBP 4.28 billion
in May and the shortfall with non-EU countries narrowed to GBP 4.19
billion.
