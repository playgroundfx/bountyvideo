Estonia's trade deficit widened in May, figures from Statistics Estonia
showed on Friday.

The trade deficit increased to EUR 175 million in May from EUR 92
million in the same month last year. In April, the trade deficit was EUR
84 million.

Exports grew 47.0 percent year-on-year in May, after a 54.0 percent rise
in April.

Imports rose 50.0 percent yearly in May, after a 52.0 percent growth in
the previous month.

"The growth was mainly driven by trade with non-EU countries: there was
a significant boost in imports of mineral fuels from Russia and exports
of electrical equipment to the USA," Evelin Puura, leading analyst at
Statistics Estonia, said.
