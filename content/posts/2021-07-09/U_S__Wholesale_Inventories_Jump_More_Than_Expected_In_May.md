Wholesale inventories in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the
month of May, according to a report released by the Commerce Department
on Friday.

The report said wholesale inventories surged up by 1.3 percent in May
after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.1 percent in April.

Economists had expected wholesale inventories to jump by 1.1 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent increase that had been reported for the
previous month.

The bigger than expected increase in wholesale inventories came as
inventories of durable goods and non-durable goods shot up by 1.2
percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said wholesales climbed by 0.8
percent in May after surging up by 1.1 percent in April.

A 1.7 percent spike in sales of durable goods more than offset a 0.1
percent dip in sales of non-durable goods.

With inventories rising by more than sales, the inventories/sales ratio
for merchant wholesalers inched up to 1.23 in May from 1.22 in April.
