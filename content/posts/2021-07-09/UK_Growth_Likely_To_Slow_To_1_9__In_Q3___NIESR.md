The UK [economy][1] is set to grow at a slower pace in the third
quarter, the think tank NIESR said Friday.

"With catch-up potential still evident in hospitality, transport,
[business][2] support and the arts, we forecast growth of 1.9 per cent
in the third quarter, still notably above [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) trend growth
rates," the NIESR said in its latest monthly GDP tracker report.

The institute had predicted 4.8 percent growth for the second quarter
and 0.9 percent for June.  
  
In May, output grew 0.8 percent monthly, which NIESR said was
disappointing with little sign of momentum in either April or May
outside the sectors which grew due to the lifting of Covid-19
restrictions.

The hospitality sector accounted for 0.7 percentage points of May
growth.

"Underlying growth is moderate outside the sectors being unlocked, with
supply constraints contributing to the continuing recent stagnation in
manufacturing," NIESR Principal Economist Rory Macqueen said.

"It remains to be seen whether the lifting of further restrictions in
July contributes to a continuation of strong growth in the third quarter
or - if cases of Covid-19 continue to rise - increased caution among
consumers and even another national lockdown."
