Food prices rose an unadjusted 0.7 percent on month in March, Statistics
New Zealand said on Wednesday following the flat reading in February.

After seasonal adjustment, food prices rose 0.2 percent on month.

Individually, fruit and vegetable prices rose 3.0 percent (up 1.8
percent after seasonal adjustment), while meat, poultry, and fish prices
were flat. Grocery food prices rose 0.2 percent (up 0.2 percent after
seasonal adjustment), non-alcoholic beverage prices rose 1.5 percent and
restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food prices rose 0.4 percent.

Prices for vegetables rose in March 2020 (up 7.4 percent), mainly
influenced by rises for broccoli, cucumber, cauliflower, capsicums, and
carrots.

Cauliflower prices rose 64 percent to a weighted average price of
NZ$5.75 per kilo.

"This reflects the average prices over the whole month. Some shoppers
may have seen higher prices towards the end of the month, with media
reports of NZ$10 or more for a single cauliflower," consumer prices
manager Sarah Johnson said.

Cauliflower prices reached an all-time peak of NZ$8.35 a kilo in March
2018.

Fruit prices fell 2.2 percent in March 2020. Prices for apples (down 26
percent) and pears (down 15 percent) both fell in typical seasonal
patterns.

Individually, fruit and vegetable prices decreased 1.0 percent, while
meat, poultry, and fish prices increased 7.5 percent, grocery food
prices increased 3.2 percent, non-alcoholic beverage prices increased
