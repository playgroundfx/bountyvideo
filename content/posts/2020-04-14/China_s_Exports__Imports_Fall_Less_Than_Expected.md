China's exports and imports declined at a slower than expected pace in
March despite the spread of [coronavirus][1], or covid-19 among its
major trading partners.

In dollar [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports decreased 6.6 percent on a yearly basis in
March, data from the General Administration of Customs revealed Tuesday.
This was slower than the expected decrease of 14 percent.

Imports were down 0.9 percent versus the expected decline of 9.5
percent.

As a result, the trade balance showed a surplus of $19.9 billion
compared to economists' forecast of $18.5 billion.

In yuan [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports decreased 3.5 percent from last year, while
imports grew 2.4 percent, taking the trade surplus to CNY 130 billion in
March, the customs office reportedly said. Economists had forecast
exports to drop 12.8 percent and imports to fall 7 percent.

In the first quarter, exports were down 11.4 percent annually and
imports decreased 0.7 percent in local currency [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

With Covid-19 spreading worldwide, the global [economy][2] faces
mounting downward pressure," Li Kuiwen, a customs spokesperson, said.
Uncertainties are on rise and China's foreign trade is encountering
major difficulties.

The World Trade Organization last week said global trade is set to fall
between 13 percent and 32 percent in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic
disrupts normal economic activity and life around the world.

WTO economists believe the decline will likely exceed the trade slump
brought on by the global financial crisis of 2008 09.
