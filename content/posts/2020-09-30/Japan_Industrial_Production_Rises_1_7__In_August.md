Industrial output in Japan was up a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent on
month in August, the ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on
Wednesday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 1.5 percent following the
8.7 percent gain in July.

On a yearly basis, industrial production dropped 13.3 percent - roughly
in line with expectations following the 15.5 percent decline in the
previous month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI upgraded its assessment on
industrial production, saying now that it is picking up.
