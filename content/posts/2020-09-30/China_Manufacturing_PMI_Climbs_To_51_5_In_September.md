The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in September, and
at a faster rate, the latest survey from the National Bureau of
Statistics showed on Wednesday with a manufacturing purchasing managers
index score of 51.5.

That beat expectations for 51.2 and it's up from 51.0 in August. It also
moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion
from contraction.

The bureau also said its non-manufacturing PMI came in with a score of
55.9 - also exceeding expectations for 55.5 and up from 55.2 in the
previous month.
