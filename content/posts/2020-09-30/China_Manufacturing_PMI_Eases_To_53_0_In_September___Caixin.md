The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in September,
albeit at a slower rate, the latest survey from Caixin revealed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 53.0.

That's down from 53.1 in August, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output growth eased but remained marked, while there was a
sharper increase in total new work as export sales rebounded.

Staffing levels stabilized, ending an eight-month string of decline.

Chinese manufacturers were generally confident that production would
rise over the next 12 months.
