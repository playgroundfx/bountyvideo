Private sector employment in the U.S. surged up by more than expected in
the month of September, according to a report released by payroll
processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment spiked by 749,000 jobs in September
after jumping by an upwardly revised 481,000 jobs in August.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 650,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 428,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

"In September, the majority of sectors and company sizes experienced
gains with trade, transportation and utilities; and manufacturing
leading the way," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the  
ADP Research Institute. "However, small businesses continued to
demonstrate slower growth."

The report said employment in the service-providing sector spiked by
552,000 jobs, while the goods-producing sector added 196,000 jobs.

Employment at small businesses rose by 192,000 and employment at medium
and large businesses jumped by 259,000 jobs and 297,000 jobs,
respectively.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its monthly
employment report, which includes both public and private sector jobs.

Economists expect employment to surge up by 850,000 jobs in September
after spiking by 1.371 million jobs in August. The unemployment rate is
expected to dip to 8.2 percent from 8.4 percent.
