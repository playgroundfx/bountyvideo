Private sector employment in the U.S. surged up by more than expected in
the month of September, according to a report released by payroll
processor ADP on Wednesday.

ADP said private sector employment spiked by 749,000 jobs in September
after jumping by an upwardly revised 481,000 jobs in August.

Economists had expected employment to increase by 650,000 jobs compared
to the addition of 428,000 jobs originally reported for the previous
month.

"In September, the majority of sectors and company sizes experienced
gains with trade, transportation and utilities; and manufacturing
leading the way," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the  
ADP Research Institute. "However, small businesses continued to
demonstrate slower growth."
