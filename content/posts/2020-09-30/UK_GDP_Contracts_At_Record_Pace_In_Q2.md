The UK [economy][1] contracted at a record pace in the second quarter
though the decline was less severe than previously estimated, revised
data from the Office for National Statistics showed Wednesday.

Due to the [coronavirus][2] containment measures, gross domestic product
fell 19.8 percent sequentially. The rate was revised from a 20.4 percent
fall estimated initially.

This was the largest quarterly contraction since quarterly records began
in 1955 and marked the second consecutive quarterly decline after a fall
of a revised 2.5 percent in the previous quarter.

On a yearly basis, GDP was down 21.5 percent in the second quarter,
which was revised from -21.7 percent.

Further, data showed that GDP fell by a cumulative 21.8 percent in the
first half of 2020.

The renewed covid-19 restrictions will probably mean that GDP stagnates
in the fourth quarter, leaving economic activity marooned 5.5 percent
short of its pre-crisis level, Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital
Economics, said. And the risk now is that renewed containment measures
send the recovery into reverse.

There have been record quarterly falls in services, production and
construction output. Services output contracted 19.2 percent, production
output fell 16.3 percent and construction output decreased by 35.7
percent in the second quarter.

Private consumption, government consumption and gross capital formation
also showed record falls in the second quarter.

Largely reflecting, reflects falls in spending on restaurants and
hotels, household consumption fell by a revised 23.6 percent. Government
consumption was down 14.6 percent.

Gross fixed capital formation decreased 21.6 percent and [business][3]
investment fell by a revised 26.5 percent.

Another report from the ONS showed that the current account deficit
narrowed to GBP 2.8 billion in the second quarter, or 0.6 percent of
GDP. This was the narrowest since the second quarter of 2011.
