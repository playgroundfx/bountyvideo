German consumer confidence is set to improve in November on increasing
propensity to consume, survey results from the market research group Gfk
showed on Wednesday.

The forward-looking consumer confidence index rose to 0.9 in November
from revised 0.4 in October. Economists had forecast the index to fall
to -0.5.

With this second rise in a row, consumer sentiment is defying rising
inflation, Rolf Bürkl, GfK consumer expert, said. The German citizens
apparently expect further price increases. That is why they consider it
advisable to make purchases in order to avoid even higher prices.

"If the upward price trend were to persist, however, this would have a
negative impact on the consumer climate and a fundamental recovery is
likely to be delayed further," said Bürkl.

The propensity to buy increased again, while economic and income
expectations declined considerably in October.
