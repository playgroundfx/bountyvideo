After reporting a sharp increase in new orders for U.S. manufactured
durable goods in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a
report on Wednesday showing durable goods orders pulled back by much
less than expected in the month of September.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in
September after jumping by a downwardly revised 1.3 percent in August.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to slump by 1.1 percent
compared to the 1.8 percent spike that had been reported for the
previous month.

The pullback in durable goods orders came as orders for transportation
equipment tumbled by 2.3 percent in September after surging by 3.8
percent in August.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts led the way lower, plunging by
27.9 percent in September after soaring by 63.9 in August. Orders for
motor vehicles and parts also slumped by 2.9 percent.

Excluding the steep drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable
goods orders climbed by 0.4 percent in September after rising by 0.3
percent in August. The increase matched economist estimates.

Increases in orders for machinery, fabricated metal products and primary
metals were partly offset by decreases in orders for electrical
equipment, appliances and components and computers and electronic
products.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely
watched indicator of [business][1] spending, climbed by 0.8 percent in
September after rising by 0.5 percent in August.

"Businesses face a rare conundrum today in which major supply chain
disruptions are making it very hard to meet robust demand," said Oren
Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "Our U.S. supply chain tracker shows that stress continues to
increase, so these challenges aren't likely to abate in the immediate
future."
