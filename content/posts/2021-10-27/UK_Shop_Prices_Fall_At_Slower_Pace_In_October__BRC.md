UK shop prices declined at a slower pace in October, data published by
the British Retail Consortium showed on Wednesday.

Shop prices slid 0.4 percent year-on-year in October after a 0.5 percent
drop in the previous month.

Food prices grew 0.5 percent annually, the biggest annual growth since
November 2020.  
  
Meanwhile, non-food prices decreased 1 percent as ongoing global
shortages of materials and supply issues with logistics and shipping
continue to put upward cost pressures on products such as furniture.

"It is now clear that the increased costs from labour shortages, supply
chain issues and rising commodity prices have started filtering through
to the consumer," Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said.

With food prices slowly increasing we can expect shoppers to start to
rebalance basket spend over the next few weeks, particularly with
increased concerns about discretionary spend, said Mike Watkins, head of
Retailer and Business Insight, NielsenIQ.
