German consumer sentiment is set to drop in March as higher inflation
dampened income prospects, market research group Gfk said on Wednesday.

The forward-looking consumer confidence index unexpectedly fell to -8.1
in March from -6.7 in February. The score was forecast to improve to
-6.3.

While the economic outlook improved somewhat, income expectations and
the propensity to buy declined from the previous month. A declining
propensity to save in February is preventing a more significant decline
in consumer sentiment, the survey showed.

The [coronavirus][1] infection rates, which were rising sharply at the
time of the survey, in connection with high inflation figures, are
causing the consumption indicator to slip again.

Rolf Bürkl, GfK consumer expert said, "Nevertheless, the prospects for
the coming months are quite positive."

Consumers' willingness to spend is expected to return. "If this were
supported by a moderate increase in prices, the consumer climate could
finally recover again in the long term," Bürkl added.

Among sub-components, the economic expectations index gained 1.3 points
to 24.1 in February. Consumers assumed that the German [economy][2] will
grow more strongly again after a weaker first quarter of 2022. Rising
private consumption will also play an important role.

The income expectations indicator declined 13 points to 3.9, which was
the lowest value in more than a year. High inflation is the greatest
threat to income prospects, said GfK.

At 1.4, the propensity to buy was down by 3.8 points from January.
Despite the current decline in the propensity to buy, the further
prospects for a recovery in consumer sentiment are quite favorable.

Moreover, the decision to gradually lift measures to combat the pandemic
will ensure that the propensity to consume will also recover.
