Eurozone inflation rose to a record high in January, as initially
estimated, driven by surging energy prices, final data from Eurostat
showed on Wednesday.

Inflation rose to a record 5.1 percent in January from 5.0 percent in
December. The rate matched the flash estimate published on February 2.

Meanwhile, core inflation that excludes energy, food, alcohol and
tobacco, slowed to 2.3 percent, as initially estimated, from 2.6
percent.

On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices gained 0.3 percent in
January, while core consumer prices dropped 0.9 percent.

Among components, energy prices showed the biggest annual increase of
28.8 percent. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices grew 3.5 percent and
services cost gained 2.3 percent. Prices of non-energy industrial goods
climbed 2.1 percent.
