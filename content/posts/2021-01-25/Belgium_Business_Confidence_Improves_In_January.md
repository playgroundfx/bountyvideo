Belgium's [business][1] confidence improved at the start of the year,
led by construction and services sectors, survey data from the National
Bank of Belgium showed on Monday.  
  
The business confidence index rose to -7.5 from -8.4 in December.  
  
"The business climate has firmed up in the building industry and for the
second consecutive month, in business-related services, too," the bank
said.  
  
"However, entrepreneurs appeared a bit more pessimistic in the trade
sector and in the manufacturing industry."

The seasonally adjusted rate rose to 78.9 percent in January from 76.7
percent in October.
