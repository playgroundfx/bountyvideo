Singapore's consumer prices remained stable in December, data from the
Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry
showed on Monday.

The consumer price index remained unchanged year-on-year in December,
after a 0.1 percent decline in November. Economists had expected a 0.1
percent fall.

This latest consumer prices outcome was largely due to a rise in prices
for private transportation cost.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.3 percent annually in December, following a 0.1
percent decrease in the preceding month. Economists had expected a 0.1
percent fall.

In 2020, both MAS core CPI and consumer prices declined 0.2 percent from
a year ago.

The statistical office expects external inflation to rise in the coming
quarters, amid a recovery in global oil prices.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average -0.2 percent this year, the statistical office and MAS said.

Next year, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average 0-1 percent, while
the CPI-All Items inflation is projected to be between -0.5 and 0.5
percent.
