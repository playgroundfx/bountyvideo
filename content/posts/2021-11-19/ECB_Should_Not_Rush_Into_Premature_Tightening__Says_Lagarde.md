The European Central Bank must not rush into a premature tightening when
faced with passing or supply-driven inflation shocks, President
Christine Lagarde said on Friday.

At the 31st Frankfurt European Banking Congress 2021, she said
tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prematurely would only make the squeeze on household
incomes worse.

At the same time, such action would not address the root causes of
inflation, because energy prices are set globally and supply bottlenecks
cannot be remedied by the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

A supply shock will tend to push up inflation and depress output. In
this situation, tighter monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would only exacerbate the
contractionary effect on the [economy][1], Lagarde observed.

Further, the banker noted that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) affects the economy with
a lag. "So, when inflation pressure is expected to fade - as is the case
today - it does not make sense to react by tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," said
Lagarde.

Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) today must remain patient and persistent, while being
alert to any possible destabilizing dynamics emerging, she added.
