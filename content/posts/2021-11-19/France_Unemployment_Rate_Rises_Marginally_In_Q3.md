France's unemployment rate rose marginally in the third quarter, data
from the statistical office Insee showed on Friday.

The unemployment rate climbed to 8.1 percent from 8.0 percent in the
second quarter.  
  
The statistical office said the rate has been broadly stable between 8.0
percent and 8.1 percent since the fourth quarter of 2020, similar to its
end of 2019 level, before the [health][1] crisis.

The jobless rate among youth aged between 15 and 24 rose to 20 percent
from 19.7 percent a quarter ago.

On average, the employment rate increased by 0.5 points to 67.5 percent
in the third quarter, the highest since 1975.

Further, data showed that the share of underemployment in employment
fell by 1.8 points to 5.4 percent, after a 0.7 point drop in the
previous quarter. This decrease was mainly due to people who
involuntarily worked less than usual.
