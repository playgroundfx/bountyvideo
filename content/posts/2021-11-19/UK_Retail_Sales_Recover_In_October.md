UK retail sales grew for the first time in six months in October, data
from the Office for National Statistics showed on Friday.

Retail sales advanced 0.8 percent month-on-month in October, after
staying flat in September. Economists had forecast a monthly growth of
0.5 percent. This was the first increase since May.

Excluding auto fuel, retail sales gained 1.6 percent, in contrast to the
0.4 percent drop a month ago and also faster than the economists'
forecast of +0.6 percent.

Non-food store was the only main retail sector that saw a rise in sales
volumes, increasing by 4.2 percent in October. Food store sales were
down 0.3 percent.

On a yearly basis, the decline in retail sales volume deepened to 1.3
percent from 0.6 percent. Nonetheless, this was smaller than the 2
percent decline expected by economists.

Excluding auto fuel, retail sales were down 1.9 percent versus the same
rate as posted in September and the expected decrease of 3.1 percent.

The rebound in retail sales in October adds to the evidence that
activity held up well in October and will raise expectations that the
Bank of England will hike interest rates from 0.10 percent to 0.25
percent in December, Adam Hoyes, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

Earlier in the day, survey results released by the market research group
GfK showed that consumer sentiment improved in November after falling
for three straight months. The confidence index rose to -14 in November
from -17 in October.
