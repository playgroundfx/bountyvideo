Austria's consumer price inflation increased, as initially estimated, in
March, to the highest level since November 1981, final data from
Statistics Austria showed on Thursday.

5.8 percent increase in February, as initially estimated.

7.0 percent.

"After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, life in Austria became more
expensive than it had been in over 40 years: the inflation rate was 6.8
percent in March 2022," Tobias Thomas, director general at Statistics
Austria, said.

The major factor behind the latest inflation was rise in prices of fuel,
Thomas added.

Transport cost grew 15.9 percent annually in March and those of housing,
water and energy increased 9.7 percent, mainly led by massive rise in
heating oil prices.

Prices for restaurants and hotels, and food and non-alcoholic beverages
gained 6.6 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively.

Prices for leisure and culture rose 5.3 percent and for clothing and
shoes increased 0.1 percent.
