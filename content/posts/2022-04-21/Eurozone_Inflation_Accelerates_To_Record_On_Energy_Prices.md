Eurozone inflation accelerated sharply, but less than initially
estimated, to set a record high in March underpinned by surging energy
prices, final data from Eurostat showed on Thursday.

Consumer price annual inflation jumped to 7.4 percent from 5.9 percent
in February. Although the rate was revised down slightly from the flash
estimate of 7.5 percent, it was the strongest on record.

Core inflation, which excludes prices of energy, food, alcohol and
tobacco, accelerated to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent a month ago. Core
inflation was also revised down by 1 percentage point from 3.0 percent.

The current inflation figure is more than triple the European Central
Bank target of 2.0 percent.

The ECB expects food and energy prices to keep climbing in the months
ahead. The central bank has projected inflation to stay elevated for
longer than earlier expected.

Headline inflation is expected to peak at over 8 percent and average
around 7 percent in the year as a whole, Jack Allen-Reynolds, an
economist at Capital Economics, said. As rising inflation will put a
dent in consumer spending, the year 2022 will be a year of stagflation
for the eurozone, the economist added.

Among the main components, energy prices showed the biggest acceleration
in March, up 44.7 percent versus 32.0 percent in February.

Food, alcohol & tobacco prices rose 5.0 percent compared with 4.2
percent in February.

Likewise, growth in non-energy industrial goods prices advanced to 3.4
percent from 3.1 percent increase in February. Services costs climbed
2.7 percent, also faster than the 2.5 percent gain in the previous
month.

Recent data suggest that inflationary pressures continue to keep
building in the euro area.

Official data showed this week that producer price inflation in Germany,
the biggest Eurozone [economy][1], hit a record high in March on the
back of runaway energy prices. Prices rose 30.9 percent year-on-year
following a 25.9 percent increase in February.

Energy prices are expected to stay elevated as European countries plan
to reduce their dependence on Russian gas and oil.

According to the Purchasing Managers' survey, conducted in March, there
were sustained increases in both input costs and output prices, across
eurozone, as firms sought to at least partly share the burden of rising
operating expenses with their clients. In both cases, rates of inflation
accelerated markedly to new survey records.
