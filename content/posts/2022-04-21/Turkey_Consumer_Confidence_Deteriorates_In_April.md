Turkey consumer confidence deteriorated in April, the consumer tendency
survey carried out in cooperation with the Turkish Statistical Institute
and Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey showed Thursday.

The consumer confidence index fell to 67.3 in April from 72.5 in March.
A score below 100 indicates that pessimists outnumber optimists.

The index measuring the financial situation expectation over the next
