Despite headwinds from the war in Ukraine, the Conference Board released
a report on Thursday showing its reading on leading U.S. economic
indicators increased in line with economist estimates in the month of
March.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index rose by 0.3 percent
in March after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.6 percent in February.

Economists had expected the leading economic index to rise by 0.3
percent, matching the increase originally reported for the previous
month.

"This broad-based improvement signals economic growth is likely to
continue through 2022 despite volatile stock prices and weakening
[business][1] and consumer expectations," said Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior
Director of Economic Research at The Conference Board.

He added, "The Conference Board projects 3.0 percent year-over-year US
GDP growth in 2022, which is slower than the 5.6 percent pace of 2021,
but still well above pre-covid trend."

The report showed the coincident economic index climbed by 0.4 percent
in March, matching the increase seen in February.

The lagging economic index also advanced by 0.6 percent in March
following a 0.2 percent uptick in the previous month.
