Hong Kong's unemployment and underemployment rate accelerated in March,
the labor force statistics from the Census and Statistics Department
showed on Thursday.

The unemployment rate rose to a seasonally adjusted 5.0 percent in the
three months to March from 4.5 percent during December-February period.

The underemployment rate increased to 3.1 percent in the three months
ended in March from 2.3 percent in the preceding period.

The number of unemployed persons increased by around 26,900 to 188,500
in January-March. Over the same period, the number of underemployed
persons also rose, around 27,800 to 117,000.

Meanwhile, total employment decreased about 54,000 to 3.61 million in
the three months to March.

"While the labor market will still be subject to pressure in the near
term, with the easing local epidemic situation of late, together with
the launch of a new round of consumption vouchers, the [business][1] of
the consumption-related sectors should gradually improve and thus
support employment in these sectors," the Secretary for Labor and
Welfare, Law Chi-kwong, said.
