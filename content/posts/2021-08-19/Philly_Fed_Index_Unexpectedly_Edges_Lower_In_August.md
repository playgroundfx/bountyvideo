The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released a report on Thursday
showing an unexpected slowdown in the pace of growth in regional
manufacturing activity.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity slipped to
19.4 in August from 21.9 in July. A positive reading still indicates
growth, but economists had been expecting the index to inch up to 23.0.

Looking ahead, the Philly Fed said most future indexes moderated this
month but continue to indicate that the firms expect growth over the
next six months.
