well beneath expectations for 5.0 percent and down from 4.9 percent in
June.

The Australian [economy][1] added 2,200 jobs last month versus
expectations for the loss of 46,200 jobs following the addition of
29,100 jobs a month earlier.

The participation rate came in at 66.0 percent - in line with
expectations and down from 66.2 percent in the previous month.
