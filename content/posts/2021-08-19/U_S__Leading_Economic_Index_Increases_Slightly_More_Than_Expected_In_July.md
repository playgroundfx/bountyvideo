Reflecting positive contributions from all components, the Conference
Board released a report on Thursday showing its index of leading U.S.
economic indicators increased by slightly more than expected in the
month of July.

The Conference Board said its leading economic index advanced by 0.9
percent in July after rising by a downwardly revised 0.5 percent in
June.

Economists had expected the index to climb by 0.8 percent compared to
the 0.7 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

"The Leading Index's overall upward trend, which started with the end of
the pandemic-induced recession in April 2020, is consistent with strong
economic growth in the second half of the year," said Ataman Ozyildirim,
Senior Director of Economic Research at The Conference Board.

He added, "While the Delta variant and/or rising inflation fears could
create headwinds for the US [economy][1] in the near term, we expect
real GDP growth for 2021 to reach 6.0 percent year-over-year, before
easing to a still robust 4.0 percent growth rate for 2022."

The report also showed the coincident economic index rose by 0.6 percent
in July following a 0.4 percent increase in June.

The Conference Board said the lagging economic index also climbed by 0.6
percent in July after being unchanged in the previous month.
