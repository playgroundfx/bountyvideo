Overall consumer prices in Japan were down 0.3 percent on year in July,
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on Friday.

That missed expectations for a flat reading following the downwardly
revised 0.5 percent contraction in June (originally up 0.2 percent).

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall inflation was up 0.2
percent - matching forecasts and slowing from 0.3 percent in the
previous month.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food costs, was down 0.2 percent on
year - exceeding expectations for a decline of 0.4 percent following the
downwardly revised 0.5 percent drop a month earlier (originally up 0.2
percent).

Core CPI was up 0.4 percent on month.
