Norway's central bank left the key interest rate unchanged on Thursday,
but continued to forecast a hike in September.  
  
The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee unanimously
decided to keep the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate unchanged at zero percent, the Norges
Bank said in a statement.  
  
"In the Committee's current assessment of the outlook and balance of
risks, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely be raised in September", Norges
Bank Governor Oystein Olsen said.

"The Committee judges that there is still a need for an expansionary
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance," Olsen said.

The beginning of normalization of economic conditions suggests that it
will soon be appropriate to raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate from the current
level, the central banker added.
