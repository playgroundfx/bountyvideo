A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a continued
decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week
ended August 14th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 348,000, a
decrease of 29,000 from the previous week's revised level or 377,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 363,000 from the
375,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Initial jobless claims decreased for the fourth consecutive week,
falling to their lowest level since hitting 256,000 in the week ended
March 14, 2020.

"The latest data suggest that the labor market recovery remained on
track in early August despite rising concerns surrounding the rapid
spread of the Delta variant," said Lydia Boussour, Lead Economist at
Oxford Economics.

She added, "Looking ahead, the virus could slow the return of workers
still on the sidelines but assuming the variant doesn't force renewed
containment measures, we maintain our positive labor market outlook and
foresee the [economy][1] recouping about 7.5mn jobs this year."

The report showed the less volatile four-week moving average also dipped
to a pandemic-era low of 377,750, a decrease of 19,000 from the previous
week's revised average of 396,750.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also slid by 79,000 to 2.820 million in the
week ended August 7th, hitting their lowest level in well over a year.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also tumbled to
2,998,750, a decrease of 110,500 from the previous week's revised
average of 3,109,250.
