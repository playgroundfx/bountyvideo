Indonesia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on
Thursday in a bid to support efforts to boost economic growth amid
projected low inflation.  
  
The Board of Governors agreed to hold the BI 7-Day reverse repo rate at
3.50 percent, the Bank Indonesia said in a statement. The previous
change in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in February.

Policymakers also decided to maintain the deposit facility rates at 2.75
percent and the lending facility rates at 4.25 percent.

"The decision is consistent with the need to maintain exchange rate and
financial system stability amid projected low inflation and efforts to
revive economic growth," the bank said.  
  
Among other [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures, the bank said it will maintain rupiah
exchange rate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to preserve stability in line with the currency's
fundamental value and market mechanisms.

Other measures included those for strengthening prime lending rate
transparency, strengthening payment systems, and promoting trade and
investment and local currency settlements.

The central bank retained the economic outlook for 2021 at 3.5-4.3
percent. Inflation is expected to remain within the 3.0Â±1 percent target
corridor in 2021 and 2022.

BI also projected a low and manageable current account deficit this year
at approximately 0.6-1.4 percent of GDP, that is expected to supporting
the external sector resilience in Indonesia.

ING expects the BI to keep [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates on hold for the rest of the year
due to the likely negative impact on Indonesia's growth trajectory.  
  
"The extended pause will allow Governor Warjiyo to balance support for
the [economy][1] while also helping deliver FX stability," ING economist
Nicholas Mapa said.  
  
The economist does not see any room for the BI to trim rates further, as
the eventual US Federal Reserve taper comes closer, due to expectations
for sustained pressures on the rupiah.
