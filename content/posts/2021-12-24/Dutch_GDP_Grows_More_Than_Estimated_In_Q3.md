The Dutch [economy][1] grew more than initially estimated in the third
quarter driven by higher household spending, revised data from the
statistical office CBS showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 2.1 percent sequentially, instead of 1.9
percent estimated on November 16. However, this was slower than the 3.8
percent growth seen in the second quarter.

On a yearly basis, GDP advanced 5.2 percent versus the previous estimate
of 5 percent and the 10.4 percent expansion logged in the second
quarter.

On the expenditure-side, household spending and government consumption
growth rates were revised up. Meanwhile, investment and trade balance
declined from the previous quarter.

According to the second estimate, employment increased by 158,000 from
the preceding quarter.
