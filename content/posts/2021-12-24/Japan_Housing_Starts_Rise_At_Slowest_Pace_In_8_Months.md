Japan's housing starts grew at the slowest pace in eight months in
November, data from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism showed on Friday.

Housing starts increased 3.7 percent on a yearly basis in November,
slower than the 10.4 percent expansion seen in October.

This was the weakest growth since March, when housing starts gained 1.5
percent. Economists had forecast an annual growth of 7.1 percent for
November.

Annualized housing starts fell to seasonally adjusted 848,000 in
November from 892,000 in the previous month.
