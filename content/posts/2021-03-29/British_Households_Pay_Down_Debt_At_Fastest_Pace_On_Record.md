UK households repaid debt at the fastest pace since 2009 amid squeezed
savings, lower income from employment and less cash available to spend,
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Scottish Widows household finance index rose to 42.0 in the first
quarter from 41.1 in the fourth quarter.

Although the score was well below the neutral 50.0 mark, the index
signaled the slowest deterioration in UK household finances since the
start of the pandemic.

While the UK is set to emerge from lockdown in the coming months, the
outlook for finances over the year ahead remained downbeat and worsened
slightly since the fourth quarter of 2020.

While the UK is set to emerge from lockdown in the coming months, the
outlook for finances over the year ahead remained downbeat and worsened
slightly since the fourth quarter of 2020.

People focused on paying down existing debt, which saw the quickest fall
since the survey began in 2009.

Income from employment continued to decline as another lockdown forced
cuts in working hours and continued furlough. The appetite for major
purchases such as cars and holidays, fell at the slowest rate since the
first quarter of 2020.

In line with lower incomes, UK households more broadly remained
concerned about job security.
