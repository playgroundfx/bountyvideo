The UK unemployment rate rose to a four-year high and the employment
rate continued to decline in the three months to November as the second
wave of the Covid-19 pandemic added pressure on economic activity.  
  
The jobless rate rose 0.6 percentage points from the previous quarter to
5 percent in three months to November, labor force survey results from
the Office for National Statistics showed Tuesday. This was the highest
since early 2016 but below economists' forecast of 5.1 percent.

The extension of the furlough scheme from October 31, 2020 to April 30,
2021 has been effective in preventing another surge in job losses,
Thomas Pugh, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The labor market will probably continue to weaken over the rest of the
year, especially once the furlough scheme finishes at the end of April,
Pugh noted. But a rapid rebound in GDP in the second half of this year
should prevent the unemployment rate from reaching the global financial
crisis levels of 8.4 percent.

"The prospect of extending lockdown makes it urgent that the Chancellor
acts now to extend job and [business][1] support," Matthew Percival, CBI
Director of People and Skills, said. "The Job Retention Scheme needs to
run to at least the end of June to avoid a cliff-edge."

ONS data showed that the employment rate dropped 0.4 percentage points
sequentially to 75.2 percent. Employment decreased by 88,000 on the
quarter.

The number of people out of work increased by 202,000 on quarter to 1.72
million in three months to November.

Average earnings including bonuses increased 3.6 percent from last year
versus the expected growth of 2.9 percent. Average earnings excluding
bonus also grew 3.6 percent compared to forecast of 3.2 percent.

In December, the claimant count rose to a seasonally adjusted 7.4
percent from 7.3 percent in November. Jobless claims increased by 7,000
from the previous month to 2.6 million.

The redundancy rate reached a record high of 14.2 per thousand.
