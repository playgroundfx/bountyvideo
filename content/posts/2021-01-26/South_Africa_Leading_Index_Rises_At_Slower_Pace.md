South Africa's composite leading index rose at a slower pace in
November, survey data from the South African Reserve Bank showed on
Tuesday.

The composite leading index rose 1 percent month-on-month to 114.5 from
113.4 in October. Compared to a year ago, the increase was 9.8 percent
versus 9.2 percent in the previous month.

Among the ten available components, increases in five outweighed
decreases in the remaining five.

The largest contribution came from an improvement in the RMB/BER
Business Confidence Index and an increase in the US dollar-denominated
South African export commodity price index.

The coincident index increased further by 1.0 percent month-to-month
basis 88.8 in October.

The lagging indicator edged up 0.2 percent monthly to 88.9 in October.
