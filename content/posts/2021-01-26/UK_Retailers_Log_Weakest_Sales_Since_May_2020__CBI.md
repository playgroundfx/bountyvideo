UK retailers posted the weakest sales since May 2020 amid lockdown
restrictions, survey results from the Confederation of British Industry
showed Tuesday.

According to Distributive Trades Survey, the retail sales balance fell
to -50 percent in January from -3 percent in December. This was the
lowest since May 2020. A net 47 percent expects sales to fall again next
month.

Similarly, the order book balance declined to -45 percent from -4
percent a month ago. A net 44 percent forecasts orders to drop in
February.

At the same time, online sales growth eased slightly to around the long
run average, with the balance dropping to +43 percent from +51 percent.

"With the lockdown likely to remain in place in the near-term, retailers
expect this weakness to continue," Ben Jones, CBI Principal Economist,
said. It is therefore vital that government support continues in
parallel to restrictions.
