Global [economy][1] is set to expand at a faster rate this year than
expected earlier as vaccination against the coronavirus could strengthen
activity later this year, underpinned by further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support, the
International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.  
  
In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the lender raised the
global growth forecast for this year to 5.5 percent from 5.2 percent
seen in October.  
World economic growth is projected at 4.2 percent in 2022.  
  
The IMF estimated 3.5 percent contraction in global growth in 2020,
which was better than the 4.4 percent shrinkage seen in October. The
revision reflects the stronger-than-expected momentum in the second half
of 2020, the lender said.  
  
"There remains tremendous uncertainty and prospects vary greatly across
countries," IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said.  
  
The latest forecast reflect expectations of a vaccine-powered
strengthening of activity later in the year and additional [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
support in a few large economies, the IMF said.  
  
Further, access to medical interventions, effectiveness of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
support, exposure to cross-country spillovers, and structural
characteristics entering the crisis could led to significant variations
in the strength of the recovery across countries, the report added.  
  
"Greater success with vaccinations and therapeutics and additional
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support could improve outcomes, while slow vaccine rollout, virus
mutations, and premature withdrawal of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support can worsen
outcomes," Gopinath said.  
  
"If downside risks were to materialize, a tightening of financial
conditions could amplify the downturn at a time when public and
corporate debt are at record highs worldwide."

The IMF stressed the need for strong multilateral cooperation to bring
the pandemic under control across the world.

The U.S. growth projection for this year was raised sharply to 5.1
percent from 3.1 percent. Growth is projected to slow to 2.5 percent
next year.  
  
Eurozone's growth forecast for this year was lowered to 4.2 percent from
5.2 percent. The projections for the big four euro area economies were
also revised down. The single currency economy is forecast to grow 3.6
percent in 2022.

For Japan, the growth outlook for this year was raised to 3.1 percent
from 2.3 percent. Next year, growth is seen at 2.4 percent.  
  
The forecast upgrade for both the U.S. and Japan were largely due the
support from additional fiscal measures.  
  
The downgrade for the euro area reflected an observed softening of
activity toward the end of last year, which is anticipated to continue
into early 2021 amid rising infections and renewed lockdowns.

The growth forecast for the UK for this year was cut to 4.5 percent from
5.9 percent. The pace of growth is seen improving to 5 percent next
year. Activity is expected to remain below end-2019 levels into 2022,
the report said.

China's growth forecast for this year was slightly lowered to 8.1
percent from 8.2 percent. Effective containment measures, a forceful
public investment response, and central bank liquidity support have
facilitated a strong recovery, the IMF said. Growth is seen slowing to
5.6 percent next year.  
  
India is projected to log the strongest growth among the main economies.
The economy is seen expanding 11.5 percent this year, which is a
significant upgrade to the 8.8 percent growth predicted in October.  
  
The upgrade reflects carryover from a stronger-than-expected recovery in
2020 after lockdowns were eased, the IMF said. Growth is seen slowing
sharply to 6.8 percent in 2022.
