Hong Kong's exports grew at the fastest pace in over two years in
December, survey data from the Census and Statistics Department showed
on Tuesday.

Exports rose 11.7 percent year-on-year in December, which was both the
first double-digit growth and the fastest rate of increase since October
2018.

In November, exports rose 5.6 percent. Exports climbed for a second
straight month.

Imports increased 14.1 percent year-on-year in December after a 5.1
percent rise in November. The growth was the fourth in a row and the
fastest since October 2018.

On a month-on-month basis, exports grew 3.3 percent and imports rose 8.1
percent.

The visible trade deficit widened to HK$45.7 billion from HK$25.6
billion in November. In the same month a year ago, the shortfall was
HK$32.4 billion.

In 2020, a year when the global trade activity was savaged by the
[coronavirus][1] or Covid-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's exports shrunk 1.5
percent from the previous year and imports declined 3.3 percent.

The visible trade deficit was HK$342.2 billion versus HK$426.7 billion
in 2019.

A government spokesman attributed the strong export growth in December
to a further revival in import demand in many major [markets][2].

Exports to the Mainland China accelerated notably, and those to the US
and the EU also saw faster growth. Shipments to many other major Asian
markets also improved.

"Looking ahead, while the Mainland [economy][3] is expected to
strengthen further and render support to Hong Kong's exports, the
prospects of other major markets will depend on how the pandemic
situation evolves," the spokesman said.

"Evolving China-US relations under the new US administration, persistent
geopolitical tensions and post-Brexit developments also warrant
attention."
