The Chinese government dropped setting economic growth target for the
first time and placed job creation as top priority as [coronavirus][1],
or Covid-19, pandemic has ravaged the outlook.

At the annual session of the National People's Congress in Beijing,
Premier Li Keqiang said the country will face some factors that are
difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty
regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade
environment.

The novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic was first detected in the
Chinese city of Wuhan late December. Since then, the virus that causes
severe respiratory illness has spread to almost every corner of the
planet claiming thousands of lives and forcing several countries go into
lockdown, pushing the global [economy][2] into its worst recession in
many decades.

By April, many countries have eased the lockdown restrictions, but
containment measures such as social distancing and wearing protective
masks are set to remain until a preventive vaccine is developed.

In 2019, the Chinese government had targeted 6-6.5 percent growth and
the actual growth was 6.1 percent, the weakest since 1990.

According to an official work report, the government aims to add over 9
million jobs and target the urban unemployment rate at around 6 percent.

The government expects the budget deficit to widen to more than 3.6
percent of GDP from 2.8 percent targeted last year, and plans to issue
CNY 1 trillion of government bonds for controlling Covid-19.  
  
The report did not provide an upper limit for the budget deficit, Iris
Pang at ING said. So it seems the government wants to be flexible on the
stimulus amount, the economist added.

The annual budget points to fiscal stimulus this year at least on par
with that following the global financial crisis and while monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is likely to remain more constrained than in 2009, the NPC did
signal further rate declines and faster credit growth, Julian Evans-
Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The work report said the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be more flexible and the
country will use a variety of tools including reserve requirement ratio
cuts and interest rate reductions to enable M2 money supply and
aggregate financing to rise at higher rates this year.

The target for consumer price inflation was set at around 3.5 percent.

In order to reduce the corporate burden, the government will cut tax and
fees for companies by over CNY 2.5 trillion.

Big commercial banks should increase their lending to small firms by
more than 40 percent this year. Further, SMEs were allowed to delay
their loan payment and interest by nine months.

Li said China will work with the U.S. to implement the 'phase one' trade
deal.

Defence spending is set to increase at a slower pace of 6.6 percent this
year.
