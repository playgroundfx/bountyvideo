India's central bank cut its key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate for a second time this year
in a non-scheduled move on Friday and extended some stimulus measures to
reduce the economic impact of the [coronavirus][1] or Covid-19, and the
consequent lockdown, as it expects the [economy][2] to contract this
fiscal year.

The Monetary Policy Committee decided to slash the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate by
40 basis points to 4 percent, the Reserve Bank of India said in a
statement.  
  
In March, the bank had cut the repo by 75 basis points.  
  
The marginal standing facility rate and the bank rate were consequently
lowered to 4.25 percent and the reverse repo rate was reduced to 3.35
percent. The reverse repo was lowered by 25 basis points in April.

"The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long
as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19
on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the
target," RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a video conference.  
  
Capital Economics economist Shilan Shah said the central bank leaving
the door open for further loosening and, with the Finance Ministry
belatedly showing willingness to provide some support, this reduces the
downside risk that the economy falls into a deep slump lasting years.

The latest decision to reduce the key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and to maintain the
accommodative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance was unanimous. However, there were different
views regarding the size of the reduction with five members including
Das favoring a 40 basis point cut, while Chetan Ghate sought a smaller
25 basis points.  
  
Policymakers are of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the
pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated,
and various sectors of the economy are experiencing acute stress, the
RBI said.

"Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity, livelihood
and [health][3] are severely affected," the bank noted.

Das expects growth in 2020-21 to remain in negative territory, with some
pick-up in growth impulses from the second half of 2020-21 onwards. The
contraction would be the first in four decades.

Elsewhere on Friday, Goldman Sachs reportedly predicted a 5 percent GDP
contraction for the 2020-21 fiscal year.

That would be as deep as compared to the deepest recession India has
witnessed since 1979, Goldman Sachs economist Prachi Mishra told CNBC.

The central bank also extended a special refinancing facility for small
industries for a further 90 days. A voluntary retention route for
foreign portfolio [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s was extended by additional three months. The
RBI also extended some special measures to boost credit for exporters.  
  
Further, the bank had announced several regulatory measures to reduce
financial stress that included a three-month moratorium on term loan
repayments. These measures were also extended till August 31. The rules
applicable for raising debt by state governments were also relaxed.

Despite the several stimulus measures announced by the government and
the central bank, there is a need to ease financial conditions further,
the RBI said, to facilitate smooth flow of funds and revive
[markets][4].  
  
"With the inflation outlook remaining benign as lockdown-related supply
disruptions are mended, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) space to address growth concerns
needs to be used now rather than later to support the economy, even
while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it
takes hold," the central bank stressed.

ING Economist Prakash Sakpal expects another 25-50 basis points rate cut
at the next scheduled meeting in early August, or even earlier if the
situation continues to worsen in the months ahead.

The government has extended the lockdown that has been in place for over
two months, till May 31 with some relaxations in areas with less number
of Covid-19 cases.  
  
The central bank aims to keep headline consumer price inflation at 4
percent within a band of +/- 2 percent. The inflation outlook is highly
uncertain, the RBI said.  
  
The bank expects the unusual spike in food inflation to ease in the
coming months after supply lines are restored due to gradual relaxation
in the lockdown, and also on hopes of a normal monsoon.

While weak demand may put less pressure on core inflation, the
persisting supply disruptions cloud the outlook, the bank said.  
  
Global factors such as lower crude prices and financial market
volatility combined with domestic elements are set to pull down headline
inflation below target in the December and March quarters of 2020-21,
the bank said.  
  
On the growth outlook, the RBI assessed that economic activity other
than agriculture is set to remain depressed the June quarter due to the
lockdown and continue so into the September quarter despite an end to
lockdown as measures such as social distancing will remain and there is
likely to be temporary shortage of labor.  
  
The central bank expects an economic recovery to begin in the December
quarter and gain momentum in the next three months as supply lines
return to normalcy and demand revives.  
  
"For the year as a whole, there is still heightened uncertainty about
the duration of the pandemic and how long social distancing measures are
likely to remain in place and consequently, downside risks to domestic
growth remain significant," the bank said. "On the other hand, upside
impulses could be unleashed if the pandemic is contained, and social
distancing measures are phased out faster."
