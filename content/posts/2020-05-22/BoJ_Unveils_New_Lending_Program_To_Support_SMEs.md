The Bank of Japan introduced a new lending program to help financing
small and medium-sized firms struggling to operate amid the spread of
the novel [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, but left its target for short-
term interest rate and the bond yield target unchanged.

At the emergency meeting on Friday, the Policy Board of the BoJ
unanimously decided to launch a lending scheme worth about JPY 30
trillion, which will provide funds to eligible counterparties against
pooled collateral for up to 1 year at the loan rate of zero percent.

In order to support financing firms, the BoJ has already implemented
purchases of CP and corporate bonds with a maximum outstanding amount
about JPY 20 trillion and about JPY 25 trillion special funds-supplying
operations to facilitate financing in response to the Covid-19.

The board unanimously decided to extend the duration of these measures
by six months. The total size of all three measures together will total
about JPY 75 trillion.

Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, doubts if these
measures will now be sufficient to secure the financing needs of firms
throughout the coronavirus crisis.

The board voted 8-1 to retain the interest rate at -0.1 percent on
current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central
bank.

Also, the bank will continue to purchase a necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

Data released earlier in the day showed that the core consumer price
inflation turned negative for the first time in more than three years in
April. Core consumer prices fell 0.2 percent on year, following a 0.4
percent rise in March.
