Fitch Ratings downgraded Australia's rating outlook citing the impact
the global [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic on the [economy][2]
and public finances.

The rating agency affirmed Australia's sovereign ratings at 'AAA' but
lowered the outlook to 'negative' from 'stable'.

Fitch said "Growth will fall sharply in 2020 and government spending in
response to the [health][3] and economic crisis will cause large fiscal
deficits and a sharp increase in government debt/GDP."

GDP is forecast to fall 5 percent this year due to the coronavirus
containment measures. Although these measures contained the spread of
the virus, they also weighed on household spending, [business][4]
sentiment and investment.

A gradual recovery is expected to begin in the second half of the year
and GDP is seen expanding 4.8 percent next year.

The agency noted that exports would be affected if China's recovery were
to falter.

The government has unveiled three fiscal packages recently to cushion
the impact of the coronavirus shock. The general government deficit is
forecast to rise to 6.9 percent of GDP in the fiscal year ending June
2020 and to 9.0 percent in FY21 from 1.2 percent in FY19.

Fitch forecasts Australia's gross general government debt to jump to
58.2 percent of GDP by FYE21 from 41.9 percent at FYE19 on the back of
the wider fiscal deficit.

Nonetheless, the 'AAA' rating reflects Australia's strong institutions
and effective macroeconomic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework, which has supported a long
record of stable economic growth prior to the current exogenous shock.
