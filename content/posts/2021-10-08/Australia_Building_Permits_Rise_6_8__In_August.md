8.6 percent contraction in July.

On a yearly basis, building permits were up 31.2 percent.

Permits for private sector houses rose 3.5 percent on month and 23.8
percent on year to 12,009, while permits for private sector dwellings
excluding houses advanced 13.7 percent on month and 47.4 percent on year
to 6,453.

The total value of building approvals was up 20.3 percent on month in
August.
