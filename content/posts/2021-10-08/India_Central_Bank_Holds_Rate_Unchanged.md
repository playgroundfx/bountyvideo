India's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Friday and
retained its growth projection for the financial year ending March 2022.

The Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Shaktikanta Das, kept the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate steady at 4.0 percent, the Reserve Bank of India said
in a statement. The decision was in line with expectations.

The reverse repo rate was left unchanged at 3.35 percent and the
marginal standing facility rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 percent.

"The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long
as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and
continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the [economy][1], while
ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward," the
RBI said.

The central bank retained the projection for real GDP growth for the
financial year 2021-22 at 9.5 percent.
