Another report from the statistical office showed that the trade balance
swung to a deficit in August.

The consumer price index rose 5.5 percent year-on-year in September,

consumer durable rose 12.9 percent. Prices of alcoholic beverages and
tobacco, and services rose by 11.2 percent and 3.2 percent,
respectively.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices increased 0.2 percent in
September, same as seen in the prior month.

Core consumer prices rose 4.0 percent annually in September and
increased 0.2 percent from the previous month.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 5.5
percent annually and gained 0.1 percent from the prior month.

The trade balance registered a deficit of EUR 467 million in August
versus a EUR 344 million surplus last year.

Exports grew 5.2 percent year-on-year in August, after a 10.6 percent
increase in July.

Imports increased 16.0 percent annually in August, after a 15.5 percent
