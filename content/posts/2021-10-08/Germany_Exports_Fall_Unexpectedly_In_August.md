Germany exports declined unexpectedly in August, data from Destatis
revealed on Friday.

Exports decreased 1.2 percent month-on-month in August, in contrast to
the 0.6 percent rise in July. Economists had forecast a monthly growth
of 0.5 percent.

At the same time, imports rebounded 3.5 percent, following a 3.6 percent
fall in the previous month.

As a result, the trade surplus declined to a seasonally adjusted EUR
13.0 billion from EUR 17.7 billion a month ago.

Year-on-year, exports growth accelerated to 14.4 percent from 12.5
percent in July. Likewise, growth in imports advanced to 18.1 percent
from 16.9 percent.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus fell to EUR 10.7 billion from
EUR 11.9 billion a year ago.

The current account surplus totaled EUR 11.8 billion versus EUR 16.7
billion in the same period last year.
