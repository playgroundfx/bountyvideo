South Korea had a current account surplus of $10.76 billion in May, the
Bank of Korea said on Wednesday - up from $1.91 billion in April.

The goods account surplus increased to $6.37 billion, compared to $2.61
billion in May 2020.

The services account deficit decreased to $0.56 billion, from $0.65
billion in May last year, owing to an improvement in the transport
account.

The primary income account surplus increased from $0.55 billion the year
previously to $5.49 billion in May 2021, in line with an increase in the
income on equity.
