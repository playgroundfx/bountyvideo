German economic confidence weakened to a six-month low in July, survey
data from the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research showed
Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment declined sharply to 63.3 in July
from 79.8 in the previous month. This was the lowest score since last
January, when the score was 61.8 and also below economists' forecast of
75.2.

On the other hand, the assessment of the current economic situation once
again improved strongly and stood at 21.9 points in July, which was 31.0
points higher than in the previous month.

The current situation was rated similar to how it was at the beginning
of 2019, with the corresponding indicator now being back in positive
territory for the first time in two years.

"The economic development continues to normalize," ZEW President Achim
Wambach, said. In the meantime, the situation indicator for Germany has
clearly overcome the [coronavirus][1]-related decline.

Regarding current expectations, Wambach said the financial market
experts expect the overall economic situation to be extraordinarily
positive in the coming six months.

The financial market experts' sentiment concerning the economic
development of the euro area also deteriorated in July. The
corresponding index dropped 20.1 points to 61.2 in July.

Meanwhile, the indicator measuring the current situation surged 30.4 to
6.0 points in July.

Inflation expectations for the euro area dropped 10.0 points. However,
more than 75 percent of the experts still expect inflation to rise
further in the next six months.
