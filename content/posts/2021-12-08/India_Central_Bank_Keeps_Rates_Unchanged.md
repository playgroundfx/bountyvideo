India's central bank left its key interest rates unchanged on Wednesday,
as widely expected.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India, led by
Governor Shaktikanta Das, decided to hold the key repo rate at 4.00
percent. The reverse repo rate was left unchanged at 3.35 percent.

The MPC has judged that the ongoing domestic recovery needs sustained
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support to make it more broad-based.

By a majority of 5 to 1, the MPC voted to retain the accommodative
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a
durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the
[economy][1], while ensuring that inflation remains within the target
going forward.

The central bank retained the projection for real GDP growth for the
financial year 2021-22 at 9.5 percent. Also, the RBI maintained its
inflation outlook at 5.3 percent.
