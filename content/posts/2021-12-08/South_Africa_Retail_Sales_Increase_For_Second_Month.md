South Africa's retail sales rose for the second straight month in
October, data from Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.

Retail sales rose 1.8 percent year-on-year in October, following a 2.1
percent increase in September. This was in line with economists
expectation.

The largest contribution came from pharmaceuticals and medical goods,
cosmetics and toiletries, and textiles, clothing, footwear and leather
goods.

On a month-on-month basis, retail sales declined 1.3 percent in October,
after a 5.1 percent growth in the previous month.

In the three months ended in October, retail sales decreased 0.1
percent, following a 5.5 percent fall in the preceding three months.
