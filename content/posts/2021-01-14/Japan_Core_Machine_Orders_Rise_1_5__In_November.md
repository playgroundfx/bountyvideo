The value of core machine orders in Japan was up 1.5 percent on month in
November, the Cabinet Office said on Thursday - coming in at 854.8
billion yen.

That beat forecasts for a decline of 6.2 percent following the 17.1
percent spike in October.

On a yearly basis, core machine orders were down 11.3 percent - but that
also beat forecasts for a fall of 15.4 percent following the 2.8 percent
gain in the previous month.

The forecast for core machine orders in the fourth quarter of 2020
suggests a decline of 1.9 percent on quarter and 13.2 percent on year.
