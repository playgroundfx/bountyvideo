The Bank of Japan upgraded its economic assessment of three out of nine
regions and downgraded one, according to the latest Regional Economic
Report, released Thursday.  
  
Many regions, while noting that their [economy][1] had been in a severe
situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus, there were signs
of picking up.

However, the impact of a resurgence of Covid-19 had been pointed out
recently, primarily in the services industry, the bank noted.

The bank raised the assessment of Hokuriku, Shikoku and Kyushu- Okinawa
regions and lowered its view on Hokkaido. Meanwhile, assessment of all
other five regions, namely Tohoku, Kanto-Koshinetsu, Tokai, Kinki and
Chugoku were left unchanged.  
  
In the previous October quarterly report, the bank had upgraded the view
of eight out of nine regions.
