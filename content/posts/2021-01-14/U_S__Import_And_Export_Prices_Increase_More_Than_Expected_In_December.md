and export prices both increased by more than expected in the month of
December.

Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.6 percent compared to
the 0.1 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month.

The report said export prices also jumped by 1.1 percent in December
following a revised 0.7 percent advance in November.

Export prices were expected to climb by 0.5 percent compared to the 0.6
