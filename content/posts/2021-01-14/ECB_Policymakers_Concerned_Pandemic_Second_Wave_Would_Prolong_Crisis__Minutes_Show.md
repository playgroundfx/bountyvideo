European Central Bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers were concerned that the resurgence in
the [coronavirus][1] pandemic that has led to restoration of lockdown in
several countries could prolong the economic crisis, minutes of the
latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session showed on Thursday.  
  
"Members considered that the impact of positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) regarding the
availability of vaccines on the medium-term outlook needed to be weighed
against the impact of the more negative latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on infection rates
and containment measures in the short term," the minutes, which the ECB
calls 'account', of the December 9-10 Governing Council meeting showed.

Policymakers pointed out that the expected shape of the recovery now
looked very different from the V- and U-shapes expected earlier in the
year.  
  
"It was possible that given the more positive starting point, the second
wave of the pandemic would not make the crisis deeper as a whole, but
would make it more drawn out than previously anticipated," the minutes
said.  
  
Rate-setters assessed that a protracted curtailment of activity might
inflict more lasting damage on a number of sectors, with heightened
risks of rising insolvencies and unemployment. This could in turn affect
the medium-term outlook for the euro area [economy][2] and more
protracted scarring effects owing to the delay in the recovery.  
  
Countries such as Germany and France had imposed partial lockdowns in
December as the coronavirus, or Covid-19, cases surged.  
  
Exceptionally high uncertainty persisted surrounding the growth and
inflation outlook in Eurozone and that positive sentiment could erode
fast in the face of negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the minutes said.  
  
Policymakers also drew attention to the exchange rate in relation to the
inflation outlook. They pointed out that the nominal effective exchange
rate currently stood at an all-time high and that the recent
appreciation could contribute significantly to the subdued inflation
outlook.  
  
They raised concerns over risks related to developments in the exchange
rate that might have negative consequences for the inflation outlook.

All members agreed on the need for a downward revision in the projected
inflation path and additional monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures, the minutes
showed.

In December, the the ECB increased the size of its pandemic emergency
purchase programme, or PEPP, by EUR 500 billion to a total of EUR 1,850
billion.  
  
Some [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers sought a more moderate increase in the PEPP envelope
on the argument that significant space for purchases was still available
from past decisions.  
  
They also pointed out the need for "keeping some powder dry" by
maintaining the option to further adjust the envelope in the future, in
an environment of high uncertainty.

Others proposed a larger increase in the PEPP envelope saying the
current boost was insufficient to ease financing conditions further and
bring inflation closer to the Governing Council's aim. Further, the
additional envelope of EUR 120 billion for the asset purchase program
would have been exhausted by the end of 2020.

"By extending and partly increasing the level of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
accommodation until early 2022, there is very little the ECB can and
would want to do," ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.

The economist said only two factors could trigger new ECB action in the
coming months: a further rapid strengthening of the euro and an
unexpected surge in inflation expectations in financial [markets][3].  
  
The next ECB rate-setting session is scheduled for January 21.
