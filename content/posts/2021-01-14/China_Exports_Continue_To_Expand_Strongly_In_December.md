China's exports continued to log robust growth in December driven by
higher global demand for pandemic-induced goods, official data revealed
Thursday.  
  
Exports grew 18.1 percent on a yearly basis in December, faster than the
expected growth of 15.0 percent, data from the General Administration of
Customs, showed. Nonetheless, the rate of increase slowed from 21.1
percent posted in November.

Driven by domestic demand, imports growth advanced to 6.5 percent from
4.5 percent a month ago. This was also faster than the economists'
forecast of +5.0 percent.

As a result, the trade surplus increased to $78.17 billion from $75.4
billion in the previous month. Economists had forecast the surplus to
fall to $72.4 billion.

In the whole year of 2020, the trade surplus surged to $535 billion, the
highest since 2015. Despite trade disputes, China's surplus with the US
rose to $316.9 billion.

Exports continued to do well, as renewed lockdowns abroad ensured the
shift in consumption from services to goods persisted in many of China's
trading partners, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at
Capital Economics, said.

But further ahead, the current strength of exports is unlikely to be
sustained indefinitely, especially given that consumption patterns
overseas should gradually return to normal as vaccines are rolled out,
they said.

And imports are likely to drop back as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support is gradually
withdrawn throughout this year, the economists noted.
