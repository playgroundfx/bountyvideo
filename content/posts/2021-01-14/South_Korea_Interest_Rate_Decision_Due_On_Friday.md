The Bank of Korea will wrap up its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on Friday and
then announce its decision on interest rates, highlighting a modest day
for Asia-Pacific economic activity. The central bank is widely expected
to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 0.50 percent.

Australia will release November numbers for home loans; in October, the
number of loans was up 0.8 percent on month, while investment lending
rose 0.3 percent.

Japan will provide November figures for its tertiary industry index,
with forecasts suggesting an increase of 0.3 percent following the 1.0
percent increase in October.

China will see house price data for December; in November, house prices
were up 4.0 percent on year.

Indonesia will see December numbers for imports, exports and trade
balance. Imports are expected to tumble 12.47 percent on year after
sinking 17.46 percent in October. Exports are called higher by an annual
6.3 percent, slowing from the 9.54 percent gain in the previous month.
The trade surplus is pegged at $2.3 billion, down from $2.62 billion a
month earlier.
