That was in line with expectations following the 3.8 percent increase in
October.

Private sector houses rose 6.1 percent, in seasonally adjusted [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/),
while private sector dwellings excluding houses fell 3.9 percent.

The value of total building approved fell 8.4 percent in November, in

falling 27.4 percent, having risen 59.3 percent in October.
