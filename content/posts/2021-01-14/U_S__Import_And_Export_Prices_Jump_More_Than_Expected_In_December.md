A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. import
and export prices both increased by more than expected in the month of
December.

The Labor Department said import prices climbed by 0.9 percent in
December after edging up by a revised 0.2 percent in November.

Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.6 percent compared to
the 0.1 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month.

Prices for fuel imports led the way higher, spiking by 7.8 percent in
December after surging up by 4.8 percent in November. Rising petroleum
prices more than offset lower natural gas prices.

Excluding fuel imports, import prices rose by 0.4 percent in December
after dipping by 0.2 percent in the previous month.

Higher prices for non-fuel industrial supplies and materials and
consumer goods more than offset declining foods, feeds, and beverages
prices.

The report said export prices also jumped by 1.1 percent in December
following a revised 0.7 percent advance in November.

Export prices were expected to climb by 0.5 percent compared to the 0.6
percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Prices for agricultural exports surged up by 1.3 percent in December
after rising by 0.3 percent in November. Higher prices for soybeans more
than offset declining prices for vegetables and dairy products.

The Labor Department said prices for non-agricultural exports also rose
by 0.6 percent in December after spiking by 3.5 percent in November.
Prices for non-agricultural industrial supplies and materials led the
way higher.

Despite the monthly increase, import prices in December were down by 0.3
percent compared to the same month a year ago. Export prices were up by
0.2 percent year-over-year.

"Recovering fuel costs may raise import prices in the near term, but
still-weak global growth will keep imported inflation subdued across
2021," said James Watson, Senior U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.
