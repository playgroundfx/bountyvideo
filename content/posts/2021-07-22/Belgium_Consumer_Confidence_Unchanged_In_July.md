Belgium's consumer confidence remained unchanged in July after a strong
increase in the previous month, survey data from the National Bank of
Belgium showed Thursday.

The consumer confidence index showed a reading of 8 for July, same as in
June.

"Consumers are again a bit more confident about the outlook for the jobs
market," the bank said.

"Conversely, they are slightly less optimistic about their future
financial situation."

Expectations regarding the economic situation in the next 12 months were
unchanged, and households continued to regard it as particularly good.

Households' concerns about rising unemployment over the coming twelve
months are gradually subsiding to a level close to those seen in the
pre-Covid era.

Consumers' savings intentions were largely unchanged in July.
