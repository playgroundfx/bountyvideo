The Netherlands' consumer confidence weakened in July, data from the
Central Bureau of Statistics showed on Thursday.

The consumer confidence index rose to -4 in July from -3 in June. The
score was below the 20-year average of -8 points.

Among components, the economic climate index rose to -10 in July from
-12 in June. The assessment of the future economic climate was less
positive and consumers' opinion on the past economic situation was less
negative.

The indicator for willingness to buy fell to zero in July from 3 in the
previous month.

Separate data from the statistical offices showed that the consumer
spending increased 8.8 percent annually in May, after a 9.7 percent rise
in April.

The growth in April and May was partly due to the consumption in the
spring of 2020 was very low due to first lockdown, the agency said.
