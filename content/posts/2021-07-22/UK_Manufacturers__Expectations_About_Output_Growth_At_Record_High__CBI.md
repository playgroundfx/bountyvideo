UK manufacturers' expectations about output growth over the coming three
months reached a record high, the Industrial Trends Survey results from
the Confederation of British Industry showed on Thursday.

In the three months to July, output volumes grew at the joint-fastest
pace on record, with the balance rising to 37 percent.

A net 44 percent of manufacturers forecast output growth to accelerate
further next quarter, this was the strongest expectations on record.

A net 29 percent of manufacturers expect total new orders growth to ease
next quarter. Total new orders in the quarter to July grew at their
quickest pace since January 1974, the survey showed.

On the price front, average costs growth in the quarter to July
accelerated to its fastest since April 1980. The balance advanced to +73
percent from +48 percent in April. Costs growth is expected to ease next
quarter.

"Record growth in manufacturing output volumes is further evidence that
UK industry is reawakening following the economic ravages of the
pandemic," Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said.
