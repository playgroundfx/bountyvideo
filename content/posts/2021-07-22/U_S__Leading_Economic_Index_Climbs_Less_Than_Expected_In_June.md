The Conference Board released a report on Thursday showing its reading
on leading U.S. economic indicators increased by less than expected in
the month of June.

The report said the Conference Board's leading economic index climbed by
0.7 percent in June after advancing by a downwardly revised 1.2 percent
in May.

Economists had expected the index to increase by 1.0 percent compared to
the 1.3 percent jump originally reported for the previous month.

"June's gain in the U.S. LEI was broad-based and, despite negative
contributions from housing permits and average workweek, suggests that
strong economic growth will continue in the near term," said Ataman
Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The Conference
Board.

He added, "While month-over-month growth slowed somewhat in June, the
LEI's overall upward trend—which started with the end of the pandemic-
induced recession in April 2020—accelerated further in Q2."

Ozyildirim said the Conference Board still expects year-over-year real
GDP growth of 6.6 percent for 2021 and 3.8 percent for 2022.

The report showed the coincident economic index rose by 0.4 percent in
June following a 0.5 percent increase in May.

Meanwhile, lagging economic index came in unchanged in June following a
0.6 percent increase in the previous month.
