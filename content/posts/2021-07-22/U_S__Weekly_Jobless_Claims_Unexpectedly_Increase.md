A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed an
unexpected increase in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits
in the week ended July 17th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims climbed to 419,000, an
increase of 51,000 from the previous week's revised level of 368,000.

The rebound surprised economists, who had expected jobless claims to
edge down to 350,000 from the 360,000 originally reported for the
previous week.

The report showed the less volatile four-week moving average also crept
up to 385,250, an increase of 750 from the previous week's revised
average of 384,500.
