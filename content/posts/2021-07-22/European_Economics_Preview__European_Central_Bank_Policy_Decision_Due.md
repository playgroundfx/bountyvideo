The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement from the European Central Bank is the
major event due on Thursday.  
  
At the governing council meeting in Frankfurt, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers of the ECB
are forecast to keep its interest rates and asset purchases unchanged.
The announcement is due at 7.45 am ET.

The bank is also expected to give more clarity about how it wants to
implement the new strategy on inflation targeting. Early this month, the

8.30 am ET.  
Other economic reports due for the day are as follows:

At 2.00 am ET, industrial confidence survey data from Norway and
consumer sentiment from Denmark are due.

At 2.45 am ET, France's statistical office Insee is slated to issue
manufacturing confidence data. The manufacturing sentiment index is seen
unchanged at 107 in July.

At 6.00 am ET, the Confederation of British Industry publishes quarterly
Industrial Trends survey data for July. The order book balance is
forecast to fall to 16 percent from 19 percent in June.
