A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed an
unexpected increase in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits
in the week ended July 17th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims climbed to 419,000, an
increase of 51,000 from the previous week's revised level of 368,000.

The rebound surprised economists, who had expected jobless claims to
edge down to 350,000 from the 360,000 originally reported for the
previous week.

"While we expect labor market conditions to improve over the rest of
2021, the bump up in claims is a reminder that progress won't follow a
straight line," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford
Economics.

The report showed the less volatile four-week moving average also crept
up to 385,250, an increase of 750 from the previous week's revised
average of 384,500.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said continuing claims, a reading on the
number of people receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, fell by
29,000 to 3.236 million in the week ended July 10th.

With the decrease, continuing claims dropped to their lowest level since
hitting 3.094 million in the week ended March 21, 2020.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims also slid to a more
than one-year low, falling by 44,000 to 3.338 million from the previous
week's revised average of 3.382 million.
