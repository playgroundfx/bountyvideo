The current high inflation driven by oil prices is unlikely to persist
for a longer period, Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor of the Bank of
England said on Thursday.

"I'm not convinced that the current inflation in retail goods prices
should in and of itself mean higher inflation 18-24 months ahead, the
horizon more relevant for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," he said.

He observed a degree of mismatch in the labor market. The mismatch added
to the near-term pressure on wages. The full-time pay of those on
furlough doesn't fall but, where there are shortages, firms have to pay
more, said Broadbent.

"The behavior of labor costs will for me be important in judging the
appropriate stance for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," he said. "This won't be
straightforward."

Unfortunately, there is still a great deal of noise in the earnings data
- base effects, shifts in furlough and in the composition of employment
are all still distorting official estimates of wage growth, he noted.

"The outlook for aggregate demand growth still matters," he noted. "And
for all the usual reasons and more, the committee will have to pay very
close attention, parsing the official data as best it can, to the
numbers in the labor market," Broadbent added.
