Indonesia's central bank left its benchmark interest rates unchanged, as
widely expected, as the [economy][1] is projected to grow less than
previously expected due to the spread of the COVID-19 delta variant.

The board of governors of Bank Indonesia, on Thursday, decided to hold
the the BI 7-Day reverse repo rate at 3.50 percent. The previous change
in the rate was a quarter-point reduction in February.

The deposit facility rate was maintained at 2.75 percent and the lending
facility rates at 4.25 percent.

The decision was in line with the need to maintain exchange rate and
financial system stability due to uncertainty in global financial
[markets][2], amid low inflation forecasts and efforts to support
economic growth from Covid-19, the bank said in the statement.

The central bank forecast the economy to grow in the range of 3.5
percent - 4.3 percent this year, which was revised down from the
previous outlook of 4.1 percent - 5.1 percent.

Looking ahead, the current account deficit in 2021 was predicted to
remain low in the range of 0.6 percent -1.4 percent of GDP.

Inflation is expected to remain within its target range of 2-4 percent
in 2021 and 2022.
