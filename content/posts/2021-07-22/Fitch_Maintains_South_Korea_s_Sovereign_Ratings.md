Fitch Ratings maintained the sovereign ratings of South Korea with a
'stable' outlook, on Thursday.

The agency said 'AA-' rating balances robust external finances,
resilient macroeconomic performance and moderate fiscal headroom against
geopolitical risks related to North Korea and medium-term structural
challenges from an ageing population.

The [economy][1] is forecast to grow 4.5 percent this year. The robust
export performance helped the economy to return to pre-coronavirus
levels by the first quarter of 2021.

Although a recent increase in [coronavirus][2] cases posed downside
risks to the domestic consumption recovery in the second half of this
year, the accelerated pace of the vaccination rollout will support
sustained recovery in consumption through 2022.

Fitch expects the general government fiscal deficit to widen to 4.4
percent of GDP in 2021 from 3.7 percent in 2020, still below the 5.3
percent 2021 'AA' median. The deficit is seen narrowing to 2.6 percent
of GDP with the government's plan deficit reduction measures.
