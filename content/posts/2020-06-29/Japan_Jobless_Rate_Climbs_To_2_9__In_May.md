The unemployment rate in Japan came in at a seasonally adjusted 2.9
percent in May, the ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said
on Tuesday.

That missed expectations for 2.8 percent and was up from 2.6 percent in
April.

The job-to-applicant ratio was 1.20, also missing forecasts for 1.23 and
down from 1.32 in the previous month.

The number of employed persons in May was 66.56 million, a decrease of
760,000 from the previous year, while the number of unemployed persons
in May was 1.98 million, an increase of 330,000 from the previous year.
