The total value of retail sales in South Korea was up a seasonally
adjusted 1.7 percent on month in May, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.

That beat expectations for an increase of 1.2 percent on month following
the 2.2 percent in April.

On a yearly basis, retail sales climbed 4.6 percent - shy of
expectations for a gain of 4.8 percent and down from the 5.3 percent
annual gain in the previous month.
