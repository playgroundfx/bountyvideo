Spain's consumer prices declined for the third straight month but the
pace of annual decrease slowed in June, preliminary data from the
statistical office INE showed Monday.  
  
The annual decline in consumer prices slowed to 0.3 percent from 0.9
percent in the prior month. The 0.9 percent decrease posted in May was
the biggest in four years.

The slowdown was driven by higher costs of fuel and electricity costs.
At the same time, food cost grew at a slower pace of 2.8 percent in June
after climbing 3.5 percent in May.

Month-on-month, consumer prices advanced 0.5 percent after staying
unchanged in May.

The harmonized index of consumer prices declined 0.3 percent annually,
but slower than the 0.9 percent drop logged a month ago. This was the
third consecutive decrease in prices.

On a monthly basis, the HICP rose 0.4 percent after rising 0.1 percent
in May.
