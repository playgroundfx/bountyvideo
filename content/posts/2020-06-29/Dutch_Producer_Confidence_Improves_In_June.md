Dutch producer confidence improved in June, data from the Central Bureau
of Statistics showed on Monday.

The producer sentiment index rose to -15.1 in June from -25.1 in May.
Nonetheless, this was below the average score of 0.6 seen over the past
twenty years.

Producers were more negative about the stock of finished goods, while
opinion on order book improved slightly, the agency said.

There were more entrepreneurs who expected their production to fall in
the coming three months, the agency said.

Confidence level was less negative than in May. Producers in the wood
and building material industry were less negative and those in the metal
industry were more negative.
