Turkey's central bank kept its key rate unchanged on Thursday, after
hiking the rates sharply over the last two months.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey governed by Naci Agbal decided to retain the key one-week repo
rate at 17.00 percent.

The bank had raised the rate by 475 basis points at the first MPC
meeting of Agbal as governor in November and by 200 basis points in the
subsequent meeting in December.

Taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, the MPC decided to
maintain decisively the tight monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance for an extended
period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation
and price stability, the bank said in a statement.

The bank vowed to take additional monetary tightening if needed.

The two rate hikes have helped to pull Turkey back from the brink of a
balance of payments crisis and restored some of the CBRT's battered
credibility, Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

As the recovery struggles to make much headway over the coming quarters
and inflation remains elevated, the one-week repo rate is likely to be
left at 17.00 percent until the end of 2021, the economist noted.
