Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the
downside, but are now less pronounced, the European Central Bank
President Christine Lagarde said Thursday.

"The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the prospects for the global [economy][1], the agreement
on future EU-UK relations and the start of vaccination campaigns is
encouraging, but the ongoing pandemic and its implications for economic
and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk,"
Lagarde said in the introductory statement to her post-decision press
conference.  
  
Amid the resurgence in the [coronavirus][2] infections, economic
activity is being disrupted in many countries, she noted. Services
sector activity is being severely curbed, albeit to a lesser degree than
during the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020, she said.  
  
Weak demand and significant slack in labor and product [markets][3]
suggest that inflation is set to remain very weak in the near term, the
ECB chief said.  
"Uncertainty remains high, including relating to the dynamics of the
pandemic and the speed of vaccination campaigns," Lagarde said.  
  
"We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with
regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation
outlook."

The bank expects economic output to continue to decline in the first
quarter due to the resurgence in the Covid-19 infections and the
consequent lockdown measures in several countries.  
  
The recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favorable
financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in
demand as containment measures are lifted and uncertainty recedes,
Lagarde said.  
  
The ECB expects headline inflation to increase in the coming months,
given the current trend in energy prices and also supported by the end
of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany.  
  
That said, weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related
sectors, as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the
euro exchange rate would mean underlying price pressures remain subdued.

Earlier on Thursday, the central bank left its key interest rates and
quantitative easing measures unchanged and reaffirmed its willingness to
adjust [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools when needed.
