Norway's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged again, at
zero percent, and signaled that the rate will remain at the current
level for some time ahead.

The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee unanimously
decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at zero percent, Norges Bank said in a
statement.

Interest rates will be kept calm until there are clear signs that
conditions in the [economy][1] are normalizing, Governor Ã˜ystein Olsen,
said.

The economic recovery is slowed down by the increased infection and
stricter infection control. Vaccination has got off to a good start and
economic growth is set to pick up in 2021.

Underlying inflation was above target, but the strengthening of the
krone since March and the prospect of low wage growth indicate that it
will decline in the future, the bank noted.

With inflation set to fall back, there is a good chance that the Bank
leaves rates on hold throughout two-year forecast horizon, Melanie
Debono, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
