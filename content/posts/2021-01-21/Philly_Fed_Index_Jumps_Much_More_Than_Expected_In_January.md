A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed a substantial acceleration in the pace of growth in
regional manufacturing activity in the month of January.

The Philly Fed said its diffusion index for current activity soared to
26.5 in January from a revised 9.1 in December, with a positive reading
indicating growth in regional manufacturing activity.

Economists had expected the Philly Fed Index to inch up to 12.0 from the
11.1 originally reported for the previous month.
