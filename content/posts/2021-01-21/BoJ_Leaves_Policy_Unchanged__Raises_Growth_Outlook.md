The Bank of Japan decided to maintain its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged on
Thursday, but raised the growth projections, citing the impetus from the
fiscal stimulus measures.

The board voted 7-1 to retain the interest rate at -0.1 percent on
current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the central
bank.

The bank will continue to purchase necessary amount of Japanese
government bonds without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB
yields will remain at around zero percent.

Markets had expected the bank to keep monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged ahead of
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) review in March.

The BoJ is likely to keep both its short-term [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate as well as its
target for 10-year JGB yields unchanged for the foreseeable future,
Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

In its quarterly Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices report,
released today, the bank said compared to October, the projected growth
rates were somewhat higher, mainly for fiscal 2021, reflecting the
effects of the government's economic measures in particular.

The outlook is based on the assumption that the impact of the pandemic
will wane gradually and then almost subside toward the end of the
projection period.

The bank lifted the fiscal 2021 GDP growth outlook to 3.9 percent from
3.6 percent. Likewise, the growth projection for the fiscal 2022 was
raised to 1.8 percent from 1.6 percent.

The projected rates of increase in the CPI were more or less unchanged.

The BoJ expects consumer prices to rise 0.5 percent in the fiscal 2021
instead of 0.4 percent forecast in October. At the same time, inflation
outlook for the fiscal 2022 was retained at 0.7 percent.

For the fiscal 2020, the bank projected an economic contraction of 5.6
percent versus prior forecast of -5.5 percent. Consumer prices were
expected to drop 0.5 percent compared to -0.6 percent estimated in
October.

The bank noted that risks to both economic activity and prices were
skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of Covid-19.
