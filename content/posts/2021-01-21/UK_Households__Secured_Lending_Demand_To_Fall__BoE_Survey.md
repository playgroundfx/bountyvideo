British households' demand for secured lending for house purchases is
set to fall in the first quarter, the Credit Conditions Survey from the
Bank of England showed Thursday.

Although demand for secured lending for house purchase increased in the
fourth quarter, it is set to drop slightly, the survey revealed.

Lenders reported that demand for unsecured lending increased in the
fourth quarter and is expected to rise further in next three months.

Banks reported that demand for corporate lending from small businesses
decreased slightly and demand from medium sized businesses declined
whereas demand from large private non-financial corporations increased
over the same period.

Demand for corporate lending was expected to fall for small businesses
in the first quarter but increase for medium and large businesses over
the next quarter.

The survey was carried out between November 23 and December 11.

While the supply of secured credit to households was unchanged in three
months to end-November, it is expected to rise over the next three
months.

At the same time, the availability of unsecured credit to households
increased slightly in the fourth quarter and was expected to remain
unchanged over the next quarter.

Lenders reported that the overall availability of credit to the
corporate sector was unchanged in the fourth quarter, decreasing for
small businesses and remaining unchanged for medium and large firms.
Overall availability was not forecast to change in next quarter.

The net percentage balance for changes in default rates on secured loans
to households remained unchanged in the fourth quarter, but was
predicted to increase in the first quarter. The default rates for total
unsecured lending dropped in the fourth quarter but was forecast to rise
in the first quarter.

The default rates were expected to increase for all [business][1] sizes
in the first quarter.
