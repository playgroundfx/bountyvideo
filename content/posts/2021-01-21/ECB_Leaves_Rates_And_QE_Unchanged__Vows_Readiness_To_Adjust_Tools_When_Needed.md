reaffirmed its willingness to adjust the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools when needed.  
  
The Governing Council left the main refi rate unchanged at a record low
zero percent and the deposit rate was kept at -0.50 percent. The lending
rate was held steady at 0.25 percent.

aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry," the
bank said.
