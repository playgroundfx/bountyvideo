South Africa's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on
Thursday in a split vote, citing slow economic recovery and low
inflation.  
  
The Monetary Policy Committee decided to leave the repo rate unchanged
at 3.5 percent, South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago
said in a statement.

Two members of the committee preferred a 25 basis point cut, while three
preferred to hold rates at the current level.

The implied [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate path projects two increases of 25 basis points
in the second and third quarters of 2021, the bank said.  
  
"The Committee notes that the slow economic recovery will help keep
inflation below the midpoint of the target range for this year and
next," the bank said.

"Unless risks outlined earlier materialize, inflation is expected to be
well contained in 2021, before rising to around the midpoint in 2022 and
2023."
