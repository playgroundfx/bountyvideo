Some [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers stressed that the Bank of Japan should strengthen its
monetary easing stance with a view to improving the output gap and
inflation expectations, and thereby achieve an economic recovery and the
price stability target early.

According to the Summary of Opinion of the meeting held on January 17
and 18, consumer price inflation is likely to increase gradually, albeit
with fluctuations, with the output gap improving and cost increases
being passed on to consumer prices.

Some members expect the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer
price index to reach around 1.5 percent temporarily in the first half of
2022.

Further, members viewed that the Bank should closely monitor the impact
of COVID-19 and not hesitate to take additional easing measures if
necessary.

Another report from the Bank of Japan showed that the corporate services
producer price index rose at a steady pace of 1.1 percent on a yearly
basis in December. Economists had forecast an increase of 1.0 percent.

Month-on-month, the services PPI gained 0.3 percent after rising 0.2
percent in November.
