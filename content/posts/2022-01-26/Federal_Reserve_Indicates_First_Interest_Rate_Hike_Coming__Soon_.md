Citing elevated inflation and a strong labor market, the Federal Reserve
indicated Wednesday that it plans to begin raising interest rates
"soon."

The Fed left interest rates unchanged at near-zero levels as widely
expected but said the Federal Open Market Committee expects "it will
soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds
rate."

The comments from the Fed were largely in line with expectations, as CME
Group's FedWatch Tool currently points to a 91.4 percent chance of a
quarter-point rate hike at the next FOMC meeting in mid-March.

In an effort to combat the economic impact of the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic, the Fed has left interest rates at zero to 0.25 percent since
March of 2020.

The Fed previously pledged to leave interest rates unchanged until labor
market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC's
assessments of maximum employment.

The central bank also said it would further reduce the pace of its bond
purchases to $30 billion per month beginning in February, with the Fed
saying it expects to end its asset purchase program by early March.

The plans to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) come as the Fed said indicators of
economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen.

The Fed also continued to describe inflation as "elevated," citing
supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening
of the [economy][2].

Noting risks to the economic outlook remain, the Fed reiterated it would
be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as appropriate.

In a separate statement, the Fed outlined plans to significantly reduce
the size of its balance sheet, saying it expects to start the reductions
after it begins raising interest rates.
