Consumer prices in New Zealand jumped a 30-year high 5.9 percent on year
in the fourth quarter of 2021, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday.

That beat forecasts for an increase of 5.7 percent and accelerated from
4.9 percent in the three months prior.

"New Zealand is not alone, with many other OECD countries experiencing
higher inflation than in recent decades," consumers prices senior
manager Aaron Beck said. "Price increases were widespread with 10 out of
11 main groups in the CPI basket increasing in the year, with only the
communications group decreasing,"

Individually, housing and household utilities increased 7.6 percent,
with home ownership up 16 percent. Transport increased 15 percent, with
private transport supplies and services up 21 percent. Food prices
increased 4.1 percent, with grocery food up 3.9 percent.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, consumer prices climbed 1.4
percent - again topping forecasts for 1.3 percent but slowing from 2.2
percent in the third quarter.

Individually, housing and household utilities rose 2.0 percent,
influenced by higher prices for home ownership (up 4.6 percent) and
actual rentals for housing (up 1.2 percent).

Transport rose 3.9 percent, influenced by private transport supplies and
services (up 5.4 percent) and purchase of vehicles (up 1.9 percent).

Recreation and culture rose 2.1 percent, influenced by other
recreational equipment and supplies (up 2.4 percent) and audio-visual
and computing equipment (up 4.7 percent).

Miscellaneous goods and services rose 1.7 percent, influenced by other
miscellaneous services (up 3.5 percent) and personal care (up 2.1
percent).
