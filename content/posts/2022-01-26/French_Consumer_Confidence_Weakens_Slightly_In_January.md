French consumer sentiment weakened slightly in January, survey results

situation increased one point to -16. Likewise, the one relative to
their future personal financial situation rose to -7 from -8.

The index measuring current saving capacity improved to 22 from 21 and
that for expected saving capacity advanced to 14 from 9.

Meanwhile, the share of households considering it is a suitable time to
make major purchases decreased, with the corresponding index falling
three points to -17 in January.

Households' assessment about the past as well as future standard of
living deteriorated in January. The indicator for the past standard of
living declined 3 points to -56 and that for future standard of living
to -33 from -30.

Further, the survey showed that the households' fears about unemployment
trend remained stable in January as the index held steady at 4.

The share of households considering that prices were on the rise during
the past twelve months continued to rise after the very strong increase
in November. The corresponding balance gained two points to 28, the
