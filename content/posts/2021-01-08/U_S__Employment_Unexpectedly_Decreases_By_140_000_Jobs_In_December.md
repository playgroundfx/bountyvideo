After reporting slowing job growth over the past few months, the Labor
Department released a report on Friday unexpectedly showing a decrease
in U.S. employment in the month of December.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment fell by 140,000
jobs in December after climbing by an upwardly revised 336,000 jobs in
November.

The decline surprised economists, who had expected employment to
increase by about 71,000 jobs compared to the addition of 245,000 jobs
originally reported for the previous month.

Employment decreased for the first time since April as the recent surge
in [coronavirus][1] cases led to a nosedive in employment in the leisure
and hospitality sector, which lost 498,000 jobs.

Private education employment also declined, while the job losses were
partially offset by gains in professional and [business][2] services,
retail trade, and construction.

Meanwhile, the report said the unemployment rate came in at 6.7 percent
in December, unchanged from November. Economists had expected the
unemployment rate to inch up to 6.8 percent.

The unemployment rate came in unchanged as the labor force inched up by
31,000 persons compared to a 21,000 person uptick in the household
survey of employment.

The report said average hourly employee earnings climbed $0.23 or 0.8
percent to $29.81. Annual wage growth jumped to 5.1 percent in December
from 4.4 percent in November.

"Looking ahead, continued restrictions on dining could see payrolls fall
further in January," said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at
Capital Economics.

He added, "But, with the high-frequency indicators suggesting that the
rest of the [economy][3] is still holding up and additional fiscal
stimulus starting to feed through, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to
be positive."
