Germany's industrial production and exports continued to grow in
November, raising hopes that the [economy][1] could avoid a contraction
in the fourth quarter, official data revealed Friday.

Industrial output grew 0.9 percent month-on-month in November, slower
than the revised 3.4 percent increase seen in October, Destatis
reported. However, this was better than the economists' forecast of +0.7
percent.

On a yearly basis, industrial production declined 2.6 percent after
falling 2.7 percent a month ago.

Compared to February 2020, the month before the start of the
restrictions due to the corona pandemic, production in November was 3.8
percent lower.

Excluding energy and construction, production in industry was up by 1.2
percent in November.

The economy ministry said the outlook for the industrial economy remains
cautious in view of the pandemic and the tightened lockdown, but the
order situation and the mood in companies have recently improved.

This suggests that, unlike in the spring of last year, industry is less
affected by the measures, the ministry added.

German manufacturers withstood the restrictions imposed in November much
better than many feared, meaning the economy almost certainly expanded
in the fourth quarter last year, Andrew Kenningham, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.  
  
However, it will contract in the first quarter as the lockdown is
unlikely to be eased until the spring, the economist added.

In November, exports logged a monthly growth of 2.2 percent versus a 0.9
percent rise in October. Similarly, growth in imports improved to 4.7
percent from 0.4 percent a month ago.

As growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports, the trade surplus
fell to adjusted EUR 16.4 billion from EUR 18.2 billion in October.

Year-on-year, imports decreased 1.3 percent, but slower than the 6.4
percent decline registered in October. Imports dropped 0.1 percent
following a 5.8 percent fall in the previous month.

On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus decreased to EUR 17.2 billion
from EUR 18.5 billion last year.

Exports were 4.7 percent lower and imports 0.6 percent lower than in
February 2020, the month before the start of the corona-related
restrictions in Germany.

The current account surplus came in at EUR 21.3 billion versus EUR 23.5
billion in the same period last year.
