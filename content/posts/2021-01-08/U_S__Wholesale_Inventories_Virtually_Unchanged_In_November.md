With an increase in inventories of durable goods offset by a slump in
orders for non-durable goods, the Commerce Department released a report
on Friday showing U.S. wholesale inventories came in unchanged in the
month of November.

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories were virtually
unchanged in November after jumping by 1.3 percent in October.
Economists had expected inventories to edge down by 0.1 percent.

Wholesale inventories came in unchanged as inventories of durable goods
climbed by 0.9 percent, while inventories of non-durable goods tumbled
by 1.2 percent.

Meanwhile, the report said wholesale sales rose by 0.2 percent in
November following a 1.7 percent spike in the previous month.

Sales of non-durable goods increased by 0.7 percent, more than
offsetting a 0.4 percent drop in sales of durable goods.

Even with the uptick in sales, the inventories/sales ratio for merchant
wholesalers in November was unchanged from October at 1.31.
