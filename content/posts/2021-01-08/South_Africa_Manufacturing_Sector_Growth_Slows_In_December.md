South Africa's manufacturing sector expanded at a markedly slower pace
in December than in the previous month, survey data from the Bureau of
Economic Research showed on Friday.  
  
The seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
declined further to 50.3 from 52.6 in November. A reading above 50
suggests growth in the sector.

This is the lowest level since July 2020, the BER said.

"The reading just above 50 index points suggests that growth is leveling
off in the manufacturing sector after solid month-on-month gains were
recorded in the wake of April's lockdown-induced plunge in activity,"
the BER added.
