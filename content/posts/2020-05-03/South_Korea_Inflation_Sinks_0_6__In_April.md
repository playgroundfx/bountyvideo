Ona yearly basis, inflation rose at a six-month low of just 0.1 percent
- slowing dramatically from the 1.0 percent increase in the previous
month.

Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food prices, added 0.3
percent on year after gaining 0.4 percent a month earlier.

Individually, prices for agricultural goods and livestock climbed an
annual 2.9 percent while utilities rose 0.3 percent.
