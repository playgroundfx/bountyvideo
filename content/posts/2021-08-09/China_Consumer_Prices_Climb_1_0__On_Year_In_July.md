Consumer prices in China were up 1.0 percent on year in July, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.8 percent and was down
from 1.1 percent in June.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.3 percent - again topping
forecasts for 0.2 percent following the 0.4 percent contraction in the
previous month.

The bureau also said that producer prices jumped 9.0 percent on year in
July, beating forecasts for 8.8 percent - which would have been
unchanged from the June reading.
