Germany's exports growth accelerated in June despite supply chain
disruptions, while the growth in imports slowed from May, official data
from Destatis revealed on Monday.

Exports grew 1.3 percent month-on-month in June, following May's revised
0.4 percent increase. The rate was expected to climb 0.4 percent after
0.3 percent growth initially estimated for May.

Meanwhile, growth in imports eased notably to 0.6 percent from 3.4
percent. Economists had forecast the monthly growth to slow to 0.5
percent.

As a result, the trade surplus increased to EUR 13.6 billion from EUR
12.8 billion a month ago. The expected level was EUR 13.4 billion.

Today's strong data illustrates that supply chain frictions have not yet
affected German exports, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist, said.
However, looking ahead, this could still change.

While order books are still richly filled, supply chain frictions,
particularly the lack of microchips, could lead to more delivery
problems in key sectors like the automotive industry and therefore to
some distortions of export data in the coming months, the economist
noted.

On a yearly basis, exports advanced 23.6 percent but slower than the
36.6 percent increase posted in May. Likewise, imports growth came in at
27 percent, down from 32.5 percent in the prior month.

The trade surplus totaled an unadjusted EUR 16.3 billion compared to EUR
15.4 billion surplus in the same period last year.

The current account of the balance of payments showed a surplus of EUR
22.5 billion versus EUR 20.3 billion surplus last year.

Shipments to the euro area countries climbed 24.9 percent and imports
from those countries moved up 22.5 percent.

Exports to the People's Republic of China advanced 16.0 percent and that
to the United States increased by 39.8 percent. At the same time,
imports from China rose 11.1 percent and that from the US were up 56
percent.
