Existing home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly increased in the month of
October, according to a report released by the National Association of
Realtors on Monday.

NAR said existing home sales climbed 0.8 percent to an annual rate of
6.34 million in October after spiking by 7.0 percent to a rate of 6.29
million in September.

The continued increase surprised economists, who had expected existing
home sales to slump by 1.4 percent to a rate of 6.20 million.

Despite the monthly advance, the annual rate of existing home sales in
October is down by 5.8 percent from 6.73 million in the same month a
year ago.

"Home sales remain resilient, despite low inventory and increasing
affordability challenges," said NAR's chief economist Lawrence Yun.

He added, "Inflationary pressures, such as fast-rising rents and
increasing consumer prices, may have some prospective buyers seeking the
protection of a fixed, consistent mortgage payment."

The report said housing inventory at the end of October totaled 1.25
million units, down 0.8 percent from 1.26 million in September and down
12.0 percent from 1.42 million units a year ago.

The unsold inventory represents 2.4 months of supply at the current
sales rate, unchanged from September but down from 2.5 months in October
of 2020.

NAR also said the median existing home price for all housing types in
October was $353,900, up 13.1 percent from $313,000 in the same month
last year.

On Wednesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new home sales in the month of October. Economists expect new
home sales to decrease by 1.3 percent to a rate of 790,000.
