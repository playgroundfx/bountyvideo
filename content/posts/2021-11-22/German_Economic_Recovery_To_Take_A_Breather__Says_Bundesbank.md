Germany's economic recovery is likely to take a breather this autumn as
the supply chain issues continue to weigh on industrial output,
Bundesbank said in its monthly report, released Monday.

The central bank observed that risks from an intensified pandemic would
exist throughout the winter half-year.

"As things stand at present, the macroeconomic effects are likely to be
less severe than in previous pandemic waves," the bank said.

The Bundesbank expects inflation to rise to just under 6 percent in
November, but to decline noticeably in January when statistical special
effects, especially the VAT base effect, expire.

"But it could still be well over 3 percent for a long time," the bank
added.
