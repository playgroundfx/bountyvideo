President Joe Biden on Monday announced his intent to nominate Jerome
Powell for a second term as Federal Reserve Chair.

The White House also revealed that Biden intends to nominate current Fed
Governor Lael Brainard as Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve System.

"While there's still more to be done, we've made remarkable progress
over the last 10 months in getting Americans back to work and getting
our [economy][1] moving again," Biden said.

He added, "That success is a testament to the economic agenda I've
pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken
under Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard to help steer us through the worst
downturn in modern American [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and put us on the path to recovery."

Biden expressed confidence Powell and Brainard's focus on keeping
inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make
the economy stronger than ever before.

"Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success
of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve -
and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20
months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong
leadership our country needs," Biden said.

Powell, who was nominated by former President Donald Trump, took office
as Fed Chair in February 2018. His current term was due to end in
February 2022.

The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) comes as the Fed recently announced plans to begin scaling back
its asset purchase program as the economy grapples with elevated
inflation.

While Biden was reportedly considering nominating Brainard as Fed Chair,
a note from Capital Economics suggested the president chose Powell due
to concerns ushering Brainard's nomination through the Senate would have
been more difficult.

"She has close ties to the Democratic party and is known to have donated
to Hilary Clinton's presidential campaign. Even as Vice Chair, she has
to attract the support of every Democratic Senator, including Joe
Manchin," Capital Economics said.

The note added, "Powell, nominally a Republican, should have an easier
ride in his nomination since he will attract some centrist Republican
votes but, with three Democratic Senators saying they will vote no, his
nomination confirmation may not be completely straight forward either."

The White House noted Biden still has three vacant seats on the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors to fill, including the important position of
Vice Chair for Supervision

Biden intends to make those appointments beginning in early December,
and is committed to improving the diversity in the Board's composition,
the White House said.
