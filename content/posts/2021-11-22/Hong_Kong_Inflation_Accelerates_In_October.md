Hong Kong's consumer price inflation accelerated to a three-month high
in October, data released by the Census and Statistics Department showed
on Monday.

Consumer prices advanced 1.7 percent year-on-year in October, bigger
than the 1.4 percent increase in September.

Netting out the effects of all government's one-off relief measures,
underlying inflation rose marginally to 1.1 percent from 1 percent in
September.

The increase in underlying inflation was driven by the enlarged
increases in electricity charges as well as the prices of fresh
vegetables.

Looking ahead, inflation pressure may go up somewhat in the near term
alongside the faster increase in import prices and the economic
recovery, a government spokesman said.

Yet, the underlying inflation should remain largely in check as domestic
cost pressures are still tame, the spokesman added.
