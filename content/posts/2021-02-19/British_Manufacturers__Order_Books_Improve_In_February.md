UK manufacturers' order books improved in February and output fell
slightly but at a more moderate rate than in the first lockdown, the
Industrial Trends Survey from the Confederation of British Industry
showed Friday.

The order book balance improved to -24 percent in February from -38
percent in January. However, the export order books balance fell to -39
percent from -33 percent in the previous month.

Output volumes in the three months to February fell at a moderate pace
of -8 percent versus -2 percent in January.

"Manufacturing activity remains patchy, but so far appears to have taken
a smaller hit than in previous lockdowns," Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead
economist, said.

However, a stubbornly mixed picture persists among the different
manufacturing sub-sectors, pointing to the asymmetric impact of
restrictions, Paleja added.
