Japan's consumer prices dropped at a slower pace in January reflecting
the end of the 'Go To' travel scheme of the government, the Ministry of
Internal Affairs and Communications said Friday.

Consumer prices were down 0.6 percent, but slower than the 1.2 percent
drop in December and -0.9 percent in November.

Core consumer prices that exclude fresh food, also fell at a slower pace
of 0.6 percent annually, following a 1 percent decrease a month ago.
Economists had forecast an annual drop of 0.7 percent.

Excluding fresh food and energy, consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent
annually, reversing a 0.4 percent drop in December.

On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices grew 0.6 percent and core
prices gained 0.5 percent.

Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics, said headline
inflation recovered substantially in January due to the removal of the
artificial drag from the Go To Travel campaign, and it is likely to
rebound further over the coming months.
