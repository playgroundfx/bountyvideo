Germany's private sector expanded in February driven by the strong
rebound in manufacturing despite increasing supply-side pressures, flash
survey results from IHS Markit showed on Friday.

The composite output index rose to 51.3 in February from 50.8 in
January. Economists had forecast the score to fall to 50.5.

February's flash PMI results point to ongoing resilience in the German
[economy][1] midway through the opening quarter, despite the country
remaining under strict lockdown measures, Phil Smith, an associate
director at IHS Markit said.

While Covid-19 lockdown measures continued to weigh on activity across
large parts of the services economy, factories reported strong and
accelerated growth due in part to surging export orders.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index surged to a 36-month high
of 60.6 in February from 57.1 in January. The score was above
economists' forecast of 56.5.

Meanwhile, the services PMI fell to a 9-month low of 45.9 in February
from 46.7 in the previous month. This was below the expected 46.5.
