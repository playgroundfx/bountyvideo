The UK private sector output contracted only marginally in February
reflecting a near-stabilization in services activity amid continuing
recovery in manufacturing, a closely watched survey showed on Friday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply flash
composite output index climbed more-than-expected to 49.8 in February
from 41.2 in January.

The score was forecast to rise to 42.2. The score was close to the 50.0
no-change threshold.

Service sector activity remained severely impacted by the Covid-19
pandemic in February. Nonetheless, the services Purchasing Managers'
Index advanced to 49.7 from 39.5 in the previous month. The expected
score was 41.0.

The reading signaled the softest rate of decline since the current phase
of contraction began in November 2020.

Meanwhile, the manufacturing PMI came in at 54.9, up from 54.1 in the
prior month and above the forecast of 53.2.

The improvement in manufacturing was driven by a return to new order
growth. Meanwhile, slightly slower rates of output and employment growth
weighed on the headline PMI in February.

Manufacturing companies often cited severe supply chain disruptions as a
factor holding back production volumes.

"â€¦ although the data hint at a renewed contraction of the [economy][1]
in the first quarter, [business][2] expectations for the year ahead
improved to the highest for almost seven years, suggesting the economy
is poised for recovery," Chris Williamson, chief business economist at
IHS Markit, said.

The survey suggested that the economy did not deteriorate further after
the probable fall in GDP in January triggered by the current COVID-19
lockdown, Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

It's only when the COVID-19 shackles are released in the coming months
that the economy will experience a meaningful rebound in activity, said
Dales.
