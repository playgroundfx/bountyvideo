The UK unemployment rate decreased in three months to July and the
employment rate rose quarterly, data published by the Office for
National Statistics showed on Tuesday.

The unemployment rate dropped 0.3 percentage points from the previous
quarter to 4.6 percent in three months to July. The rate came in line
with economists' expectations.

At the same time, the employment rate rose 0.5 percentage points to 75.2
percent.

Average earnings including bonus grew 8.3 percent on a yearly basis and
regular pay that excludes bonuses advanced 6.8 percent in May to July
period.

The ONS said since this growth is affected by base and compositional
effects, interpretation should be taken with caution.

Further, data showed that the claimant count decreased by 58,600 in
August from the previous month. The claimant count rate came in at
seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent versus 5.6 percent in July.
