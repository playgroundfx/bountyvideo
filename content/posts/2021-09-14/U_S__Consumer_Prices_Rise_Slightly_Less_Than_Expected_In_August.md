A highly anticipated report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday
showed a modest increase in U.S. consumer prices in the month of August.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.3 percent
in August after climbing by 0.5 percent in July. Economists had expected
consumer prices to increase by 0.4 percent.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices inched up by 0.1
percent in August after rising by 0.3 percent in July. Economists had
been expecting another 0.3 percent increase.
