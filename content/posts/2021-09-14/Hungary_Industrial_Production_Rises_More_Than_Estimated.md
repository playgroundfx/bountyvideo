Hungary's industrial production rose more than initially estimated in
July, data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on
Tuesday.

Industrial production grew a working-day adjusted 10.9 percent year-on-
year in July, after a 14.8 percent rise in June. In the initial
estimate, output rose 10.2 percent.

The industrial production volume increased 8.0 percent yearly in July,
as estimated.

Majority of the manufacturing subsections contributed to the growth in
July. The largest contribution came from manufacture of electrical
equipment, while manufacture of transport equipment declined.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production fell 0.5 percent
in July, following 0.3 percent decline in the preceding month.
