A highly anticipated report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday
showed a modest increase in U.S. consumer prices in the month of August.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.3 percent
in August after climbing by 0.5 percent in July. Economists had expected
consumer prices to increase by 0.4 percent.

The consumer price growth was partly due to another sharp increase in
energy prices, which spiked by 2.0 percent in August after jumping by
1.6 percent in July. Gasoline prices led the way higher, soaring by 2.8
percent.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices inched up by just
0.1 percent in August after rising by 0.3 percent in July. Economists
had been expecting another 0.3 percent increase.

Higher prices for household operations and shelter contributed to the
uptick in core prices, which reflected the smallest increase since
February.

A 9.1 nosedive in prices for airline fares limited the upside for core
prices along with lower prices for used cars and trucks and motor
vehicle insurance.

The report also showed a slowdown in the annual rate of consumer price
growth, which dipped to 5.3 percent in August from 5.4 percent in July.

The annual rate of core consumer price growth also slowed to 4.0 percent
in August from 4.3 percent in the previous month.

"We believe the annual rate peaked in June as the strong base effects
are subsiding and wholesale price increases for used car and trucks have
moderated greatly," said Kathy Bostjancic, Chief U.S. Financial
Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "That said, price increases stemming from the ongoing supply
chain bottlenecks amid strong demand will keep the rate of inflation
elevated and sticky as supply/demand imbalances are only gradually
resolved."

A separate report released by the Labor Department last Friday showed
producer prices increased by slightly more than expected in the month of
August.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
climbed by 0.7 percent in August after jumping by 1.0 percent for two
straight months. Economists had expected producer prices to increase by
0.6 percent.

Excluding prices for food, energy and trade services, core producer
prices rose by 0.3 percent in August following a 0.9 percent advance in
July. Core prices were expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

With another monthly increase, the annual rate of growth in producer
prices accelerated to 8.3 percent in August from 7.8 percent in July,
reflecting the largest advance since 12-month data were first calculated
in November 2010.

The annual rate of growth in core producer prices also ticked up to 6.3
percent in August from 6.1 percent in July, showing the largest year-
over-year increase since data were first calculated in August 2014.
