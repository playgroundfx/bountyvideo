Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said the conditions
required to lift the key cash rate would not be met before 2024 and
market expectations for an early rate hike is out of place.

In a speech to the Anika Foundation in Sydney on Tuesday, Lowe said "I
find it difficult to understand why rate rises are being priced in next
year or early 2023."

"While [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates might be increased in other countries over this
timeframe, our wage and inflation experience is quite different," he
added.

Given that the recovery has been delayed, it would be appropriate to
delay any  
consideration of a further taper in bond purchases until next year, Lowe
said.

"By February we will know more about how the [economy][1] is responding
to the easing of restrictions than we will know in November," he added.

At the September meeting, the RBA pressed ahead with tapering its asset
purchases. The board decided to purchase government securities at the
rate of A$4 billion a week and extended the duration by three months to
at least mid February.

Although the Delta outbreak has delayed the economic recovery, it has
not derailed it, Lowe said. He expects the economy to be growing again
in the December quarter, with the recovery continuing into 2022.

On labor market, Lowe said total hours worked are set to fall 3-4
percent in the September quarter. There is uncertainty about the
unemployment rate but it would not be surprising to see readings in the
high fives for a short period of time.  
  
Elsewhere, a survey from the National Australia Bank showed that both
[business][2] conditions and confidence saw a small improvement in the
month, though the latter remained well into negative territory.

The business conditions index rose 4 points to +14 in August after
declining sharply over the previous two months. At the same time, the
business confidence also improved slightly, up two points to -5.
