The Reserve Bank of India will not hesitate to use conventional and
unconventional tools to mitigate the impact of [coronavirus][1], or
COVID-19, and revive growth and preserve financial stability, Governor
Shaktikanta Das said.

According to the minutes of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee meeting held
on March 24, 26 and 27, the governor said it is comforting that the
macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian [economy][2] continue to be
sound compared with the conditions that prevailed in the aftermath of
the global financial crisis.

At the meeting, the committee had reduced the repo rate by 75 basis
points and adjusted the marginal standing facility and the bank rate.
The cash reserve ratio was lowered by 100 basis points.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an invisible assassin which needs to be
contained quickly and the situation currently facing the country is
unprecedented, the governor noted.

It is imperative to make all-out efforts to protect the domestic economy
from the adverse impact of the pandemic.

"The path to normalisation of activity, however, is contingent on how
India's COVID-19 epidemiological curve evolves, amidst heightened
uncertainty," he added.

In this challenging circumstance, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has to assume an avant
garde role, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker Michael Patra, said. He said the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
has to provide confidence and assuage fear.

Janak Raj, another MPC member said the main challenge for monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at this juncture is to ensure that the adverse impact of COVID-19
on domestic demand is not amplified.
