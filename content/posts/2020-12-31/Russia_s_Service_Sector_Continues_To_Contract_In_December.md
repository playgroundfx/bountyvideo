Russia's service sector logged another downturn in [business][1]
activity but the pace of contraction remained moderate at the end of the
year, survey results from IHS Markit showed Thursday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.0 in December from
48.2 in the previous month. A score below 50 indicates contraction in
the sector.

The survey showed third consecutive fall in new business due to muted
customer demand and fall in purchasing power. Likewise, the fall in new
export sales eased in December.

Service providers reported a substantial increase in cost burdens in
December.  
Although the rate of input price inflation softened, it was the second-
fastest since March. Selling prices increased the most since April 2019.

Service sector firms were more upbeat regarding the outlook for output
over the coming 12 months.

In an effort to cut costs, Russian service sector firms reduced their
workforce numbers at a solid pace at the end of 2020.
