The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its August 3 monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, highlighting a light day for Asia-
Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the RBA decided to continue scaling back its bond
purchases despite expectations for delaying the tapering process amid
the restrictions in place in Sydney and other parts of the country.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board also decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a
record low of 0.10 percent and also maintained the target of 10 basis
points for the April 2024 Australian Government bond.

Singapore will see July results for non-oil domestic exports, with
forecasts suggesting a decline of 0.7 percent on month and a spike of
12.0 percent on year. That follows the 6.0 percent monthly increase and
the 15.9 percent annual gain in June.

Japan will release June results for its tertiary industry index; in May,
the index fell 2.7 percent on month.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Indonesia are closed on Tuesday for
Independence Day and will re-open on Wednesday.
