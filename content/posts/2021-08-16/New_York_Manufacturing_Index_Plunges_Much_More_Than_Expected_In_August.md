New York manufacturing activity saw significantly slower growth in the
month of August, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York on Monday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index plunged
to 18.3 in August from 43.0 in July. While a positive reading still
indicates growth, economists had expected the index to show a much more
modest drop to 30.0.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months, with substantial
increases in employment and prices expected.
