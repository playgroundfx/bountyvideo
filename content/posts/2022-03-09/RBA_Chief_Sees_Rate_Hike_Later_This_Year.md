Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said an interest rate
hike is plausible later this year as waiting too long could lift risks
to inflation.

"In this uncertain environment - and with the starting points for wages
growth and underlying inflation in Australia - we can take the time to
assess the incoming information and review how the uncertainties are
resolved," Lowe said at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit,
on Wednesday.

Given the outlook, though, it is plausible that the cash rate will be
increased later this year, said Lowe.

The governor noted that there is a risk to waiting too long, especially
in a world with overlapping supply shocks and a high headline inflation
rate. But there is also a risk of moving too early, as raises risks to
achieving full employment.

Lowe observed that the war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia
have created a new supply shock that is pushing prices up, especially
for commodities. This new supply shock will extend the period of
inflation being above central banks' targets.

Further, he noted that there is a risk if higher inflation rates are
sustained as a result of a sequence of negative supply shocks that wages
growth picks up more quickly than forecast as workers seek compensation
for the higher inflation.

"I want to finish with the point that it is only possible to achieve a
sustained period of low unemployment if inflation remains low and
stable," said Lowe.
