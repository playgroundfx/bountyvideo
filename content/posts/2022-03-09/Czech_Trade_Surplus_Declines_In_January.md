The Czech Republic's trade surplus decreased in January, data from the
Czech Statistical Office showed on Wednesday.

The trade surplus decreased to CZK 6.159 billion in January from CZK
24.796 billion in the same month a year ago. Economists had expected a
deficit of CZK 7.800 billion.

In December, the trade balance showed a deficit of CZK 15.118 billion.

The visible trade balance was negatively affected mainly by an annual
increase in the trade deficit in 'crude petroleum and natural gas', due
to the impact of rising prices in world [markets][1], the agency said.

Exports grew 12.9 percent annually in July and imports gained 20.9
percent.

The trade surplus with EU Member States improved by CZK 4.7 billion from
a year ago. The Czech crown strengthened against the euro on average by
6.8 percent annually in January. The trade deficit with non-EU countries
increased by CZK 23.0 billion.

On a month-on-month basis, seasonally adjusted exports increased 3.2
percent in January, while imports gained 4.0 percent.
