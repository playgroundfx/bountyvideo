Indonesia's consumer confidence weakened in February to a five-month
low, but households remained optimistic, survey data from the Bank
Indonesia showed on Wednesday.

The consumer confidence index fell to 113.1 in February from 119.6 in
January. In the same month last year, the reading was 85.8.

The latest reading was the lowest since September.

The expectations index dropped to 130.8 and the current conditions index
fell to 95.5. Both readings were also the lowest since September.

"Consumers were slightly less upbeat in February 2022 due to more
subdued expectations of future economic conditions in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of income,
job availability and [business][1] activity, though remaining
optimistic," the central bank said.

"At the same time, consumer perception of current economic conditions
was hampered by a surge of Covid-19 cases and tighter community activity
restrictions (PPKM) in various regions of the Indonesian archipelago."
