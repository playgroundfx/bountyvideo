Japan's gross domestic product expanded an annualized 4.6 percent on
year in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Cabinet Office said on Wednesday
- well shy of forecasts for a gain of 5.6 percent following the
downwardly revised 2.8 percent contraction in the previous three months
(originally -2.7 percent).

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP was up just 1.1 percent -
again missing expectations for 1.4 percent after shrinking 0.7 percent
in the three months prior.

Capital expenditure added 0.3 percent on quarter, missing forecasts for
0.7 percent after contracting 2.4 percent in Q3.

External demand rose 0.2 percent on quarter, matching forecasts and up
from 0.1 percent in the third quarter.
