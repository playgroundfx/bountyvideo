Italy's industrial production declined the most since late 2020, the
statistical office Istat reported Wednesday.

Industrial output fell 3.4 percent month-on-month, but bigger than
December's 1.1 percent decrease. This was the biggest fall since
September 2020, when output was down 4.8 percent.

All major sectors declined from the previous month. Energy production
shrank 5.2 percent and consumer goods by 3.6 percent. Production of
intermediate goods and capital goods fell 3.4 percent and 1.6 percent,
respectively.

On a yearly basis, industrial output decreased by [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted 2.6
percent, in contrast to the 4.8 percent increase in December. Production
dropped for the first time since February 2021.

The unadjusted industrial production growth slowed sharply to 0.4
percent from 8.1 percent a month ago.

In its monthly report, released Wednesday, the statistical office said
an estimation of the impact of the international crisis is extremely
complex.

A counterfactual analysis of the Italian [economy][1] shows that the
actual level of oil prices might subtract 0.7 percentage points to GDP
growth in 2022.
