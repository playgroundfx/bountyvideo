Sweden's industrial production rebounded in January, led by strong
growth in the chemical industry, data from Statistics Sweden showed on
Wednesday.

Industrial production grew 3.9 percent annually in January, after a
revised 0.6 percent drop in December.

The biggest upward contribution came from the chemical industry, where
output grew over 40 percent, while the largest downward contribution
came from the basic metals industry.

The overall private sector output rose 7.6 percent following a 7.4
percent growth in the previous month.

Construction output growth slowed to 7.5 percent from a downward revised
8.2 percent. Services growth, excluding finance and insurance sectors,
eased to 8.8 percent from 9.7 percent.

Another report from the statistical office showed that industrial orders
gained 3.6 percent year-on-year in January. Domestic orders increased
2.6 percent and foreign demand by 5.1 percent.

The largest increase was recorded in the transport industry, up 44.3
percent.

Compared to the previous month, orders grew 9.9 percent in January, with
domestic demand rising 3.5 percent and foreign bookings growing 14.2
percent.

The statistical office said household consumption gained 5.1 percent
yearly in January, with the largest positive contribution coming from
recreation and culture, goods and services.

The biggest negative contribution came from the housing, electricity,
gas and heating component.

On a monthly basis, household spending remained unchanged in January.

The statistical office also reported that the GDP indicator decreased
0.3 percent monthly in January, but economic activity rose 4.6 percent
from a year ago.

"After four months of growth, the development in January turned slightly
downwards," Melker Loberg, statistician at Statistics Sweden, said.
