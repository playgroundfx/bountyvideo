The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development downgraded
global growth outlook for next year and called for determined [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
action to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.

The world [economy][1] is projected to shrink 4.2 percent this year
before rebounding 4.2 percent in 2021, the Paris-based agency said in
its economic outlook, released Tuesday.

The agency upgraded its 2020 outlook from -4.5 percent but lowered the
projection for next year from 5 percent. The growth is seen at 3.7
percent in 2022.

According to latest estimate, global GDP is set to reach pre-pandemic
levels by the end of 2021.

The prospect of a number of Covid-19 vaccines becoming widely available
next year has raised hopes that recovery is in sight. But the path
remains long and difficult, said OECD.

The recovery would be stronger if vaccines are rolled out fast, boosting
confidence and lowering uncertainty, the agency said. At the same time,
delays to vaccination deployment, difficulties controlling new virus
outbreaks and failure to learn lessons from the first wave would weaken
the outlook.

"Building back better requires leadership and action to build on the
promises of vaccines, and to relaunch multilateral negotiations on
trade, climate and digital standards to pave the way for a more
sustainable growth and a society where opportunities are available for
all," OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr√≠a said.

The OECD observed that achieving a stronger, sustainable and inclusive
global economy will require determined [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action now.

Activity in China is projected to return to its past trajectory, with
growth of 8 percent in 2021 and 4.9 percent in 2022.

After shrinking 3.7 percent this year, the US economy is forecast to
expand 3.2 percent in 2021 and 3.5 percent in 2022.

The OECD said growth is expected to pick up through 2021, reflecting an
assumed additional fiscal package that will particularly support
household incomes and consumption.

After experiencing one of the world's tightest lockdowns and recording
the deepest GDP contraction among G20 economies in the second quarter of
2020, the Indian economy is recovering, the agency noted.

India is forecast to contract sharply by 9.9 percent in 2020 before
rebounding 7.9 percent next year and 4.8 percent in 2022. Nonetheless,
the GDP loss will be substantial.

Eurozone will grow about 3.25 percent in 2022 and 3.6 percent in 2021
after falling 7.5 percent in 2020. This will bring output back to its
pre-pandemic levels only at the end of 2022, OECD said.

In order to avoid a premature tightening that could derail the recovery,
national fiscal policies should also remain supportive over the coming
two years.

Driven by a rebound of consumption, the UK economy will grow 4.2 percent
in 2021 and 4.1 percent in 2022, the agency said. The GDP fall for 2020
was estimated at 11.2 percent.
