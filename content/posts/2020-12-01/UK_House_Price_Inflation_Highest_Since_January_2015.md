UK house prices rose the most in nearly six years in November, but the
outlook remains highly uncertain and the housing market activity is set
to slow in the coming quarters amid a surge in the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic that has forced a partial lockdown in some regions, the
Nationwide Building Society said Tuesday, citing results of the monthly
house price survey.

The house price index rose 6.5 percent year-on-year, which was the
fastest pace of increase since January 2015. House price inflation was
5.8 percent in October. Economists had forecast a 5.5 percent increase.

Compared to the previous month, house prices climbed a seasonally
adjusted 0.9 percent in November after a 0.8 percent increase in
October. Economists had expected the rate to slow to 0.3 percent.

In October, property transactions rose to 105,600, the highest level
since 2016, while mortgage approvals for house purchase were at their
highest level since 2007.

Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said the outlook remains highly
uncertain and will depend heavily on how the pandemic and the measures
to contain it evolve as well as the efficacy of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures
implemented to limit the damage to the wider [economy][2].

"Behavioral shifts as a result of Covid-19 may provide support for
housing market activity, while the stamp duty holiday will continue to
provide a near term boost by bringing purchases forward," Gardner said.

"However, housing market activity is likely to slow in the coming
quarters, perhaps sharply, if the labor market weakens as most analysts
expect, especially once the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of
March."
