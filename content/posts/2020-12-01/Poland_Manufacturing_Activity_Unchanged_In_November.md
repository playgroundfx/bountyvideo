Poland's manufacturing sector growth remained unchanged in November,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, remained unchanged
at 50.8 in November.

Economists had forecast the PMI to remain neutral at 50. Any reading
above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

New orders declined for the second month in November and fall in new
work weighed on production.

Backlogs of work rose for the second straight month in November and
recruitment accelerated for the third month in a row, with the rate of
job creation fastest since June 2018.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened the most since May to the fifth
lowest ever recorded.

Input price inflation rose at the fastest rate in November, while output
prices rose only modestly.

The 12-month outlook for production remained positive and imporved
slightly since October.

"Overall, Poland's manufacturing sector has seen only a tepid recovery
so far following the first lockdown," Trevor Balchin, economics director
at IHS Markit, said.
