The UK manufacturing sector growth strengthened in November before the
end of the Brexit transition period, final data from IHS Markit showed
Tuesday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply factory
Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a 35-month high of 55.6 in November
from 53.7 in October. The flash reading was 55.2.

Production increased again in November driven by the re-opening of
factories following the Covid-19 closures earlier in the year and
improving demand.

Whether the upturn of manufacturing production can be sustained into the
new year is highly uncertain, especially once the temporary boosts from
Brexit purchasing and stockbuilding wane, Rob Dobson, director at IHS
Markit, said.

Incoming new [business][1] continued to rise, in part boosted by EU
clients bringing forward purchases before the Brexit transition period
ends.

Further, the survey showed that input buying volumes increased to the
greatest extent since March 2019, mainly to achieve the steepest growth
in stocks of purchases for over a year.

Despite business optimism about the year ahead rising to a six-year
high, manufacturing job losses were recorded for the tenth consecutive
month in November.

Input cost inflation accelerated to a two-year high in November.
Companies responded by raising their average selling prices to the
greatest extent in the year so far.
