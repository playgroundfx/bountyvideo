China's manufacturing sector logged its strongest growth in a decade in
November, to indicate a sustained recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak,
survey data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.

The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.9 in
November from 53.6 in October. A score above 50 indicates expansion in
the sector.

This was the highest score since November 2010. The sector has expanded
in each of the past seven months.

Manufacturing companies reported that production increased at the
fastest pace in ten years driven by new orders as well as further
recovery from the Covid-19 related disruptions seen earlier in the year.

New orders also advanced the most in a decade underpinned by firmer
domestic demand. Growth in new export work was not as marked as that
seen for total new orders.

The sustained and strong upturn in client demand led to the fastest
increase in employment since May 2011. At the same time, firms raised
their purchasing activity at the steepest rate since January 2011.

Greater market demand contributed to stronger inflationary pressures,
with both input costs and output charges rising at sharper rates, the
survey showed.

Business confidence regarding the 12-month outlook for output remained
strongly positive in November, despite easing slightly since October.

"We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue
for several months," Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group
said.

"At the same time, deciding [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) gradually withdraw the easing
policies launched during the epidemic will require careful planning as
uncertainties still exist inside and outside China," the economist
added.
