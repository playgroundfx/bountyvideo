Poland's consumer price inflation slowed for the second straight month
in November, preliminary data from Statistics Poland showed on Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 3.0 percent year-on-year in November,
after a 3.1 percent increase in October. This was in line with
economists' expectations.

In September, inflation was 3.2 percent.

Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages grew 2.0 percent yearly in
November and those of electricity, gas and other fuels gained by 4.7
percent.

Meanwhile, prices of fuels for transport declined 9.2 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices remained unchanged in
November.
