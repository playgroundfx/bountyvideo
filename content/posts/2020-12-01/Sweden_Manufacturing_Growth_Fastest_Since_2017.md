Swedish manufacturing sector expanded in November at the fastest pace
since the fourth quarter of 2017 amid an increase in production and
demand, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association SILF
showed on Tuesday.

The purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for manufacturing rose to 59.1
from a revised 58.3 in October.

A reading above 50 suggests growth in the sector. The score remained
above its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average of 54.4 for a third month in a row.

Three out of five sub-indexes of the PMI were above the 60-level for the
second month in a row, suggesting robust growth.  
  
"Swedish industry continues to show robust growth at the same time as
production plans have become more expansive despite an increased spread
of infection and stricter restrictions," JÃ¶rgen Kennemar, a PMI analyst
at Swedbank, said.

"Instead, order intake for Swedish industry continues to increase, not
least from the export market."
