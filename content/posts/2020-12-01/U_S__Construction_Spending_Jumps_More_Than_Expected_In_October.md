A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed
construction spending in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the
month of October.

The Commerce Department said construction spending jumped by 1.3 percent
to an annual rate of $1.439 trillion in October after falling by 0.5
percent to a revised rate of $1.420 trillion in September.

Economists had expected construction spending to climb by 0.8 percent
compared to the 0.3 percent uptick originally reported for the previous
month.

The bigger than expected increase in construction spending came as
spending on private construction surged up by 1.4 percent to an annual
rate of $1.094 trillion.

Spending on residential construction spiked by 2.9 percent to a rate of
$637.1 billion, more than offsetting a 0.7 percent drop in spending on
non-residential construction to a rate of $456.6 billion.

The report also said spending on private construction climbed by 1.0
percent to an annual rate of $344.8 billion. Spending on educational and
highway construction both increased.
