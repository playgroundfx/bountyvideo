Ireland's manufacturing sector expansion improved for the fifth month in
a row in November, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Tuesday.

The seasonally adjusted AIB factory Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI,
rose to 52.2 in November from 50.3 in October.

The latest reading was the third highest since April 2019. Any reading
above 50.0 indicates expansion in the sector.

Volume of new orders rose for the first time in three months, mainly due
to the volume of exports remaining unchanged.

Output rose four times in past six months in November and backlogs of
work declined at the fastest rate since June.

Employment increased for the first time since August 2019 and reflected
greater confidence regarding the future output trends, with firms'
expectations the strongest since January.

Purchasing activity rose for the first time in four months and delivery
time lengthened in November. Inventories of finished goods declined
sharply in November.

The rate of input price inflation rose sharply since February last year
and output prices rose for the second straight month, at the fastest
rate since March 2019.

"The impact of the imminent end to the Brexit transition period
manifested itself in some stockpiling, with purchases of inputs rising
and a sharp jump in the stocks of inputs," Oliver Mangan, AIB chief
economist, said.

"Overall, the November PMI data show that, as in other countries, the
sector is coping well with the second lockdown and is increasingly
confident about prospects for 2021," Mangan, said.
