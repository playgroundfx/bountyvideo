The manufacturing sector in Australia continued to expand in November,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from the Australian Industry
Group revealed on Tuesday with a seasonally adjusted Performance of
Manufacturing Index score of 52.1.

That's down from 56.3 in October although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The result largely reflects stabilization in conditions after a bounce-
back into positive territory, following Victoria's easing of activity
restrictions in October. South Australia had the largest fall of any
state due to lost production from the three-day shutdown.

Still, it remained in positive territory because of robust agricultural
conditions, which boosted demand for food & beverage and machinery &
equipment manufacturers. Victoria recorded its first month of expansion
since March.
