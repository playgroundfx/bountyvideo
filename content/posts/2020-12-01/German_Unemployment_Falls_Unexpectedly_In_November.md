German unemployment declined unexpectedly in November despite new
restrictions introduced to curb the Covid-19 infection, the Federal
Labor Agency revealed Tuesday.

The number of people out of work decreased 39,000 in November after
falling 38,000 in October. Economists had forecast a monthly increase of
8,000.

The jobless rate fell to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent in the previous
month. The rate was forecast to rise to 6.3 percent.

Strong German labor market report for November suggests very little
impact from the second lockdown, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said.

But the rising number of short-time workers, as well as the longer-term
impact from the second lockdown, clearly argue against too much
optimism, the economist added.

Earlier in the day, labor force survey data released by Destatis showed
that the jobless rate remained at seasonally adjusted 4.5 percent in
October.

The number of unemployed persons decreased by unadjusted 12,000 from the
previous month to 1.93 million.
