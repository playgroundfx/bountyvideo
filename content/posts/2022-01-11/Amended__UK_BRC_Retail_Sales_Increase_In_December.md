UK retail sales increased in December despite the recent Omicron
outbreak, data released by the British Retail Consortium, or BRC, showed
on Tuesday.

Retail sales grew 2.1 percent on a yearly basis in December. For the
whole year of 2021, retail sales were up 9.9 percent.

Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, said many people chose to shop
online rather than travel to nearby high streets and shopping centres.
Loungewear was back in fashion, as many pre-empted the possibility of
future restrictions.

"As we head into 2022, retailers will be keeping close to Government
COVID-19 updates and hoping consumer confidence holds up in order to
offset the rising cost challenges they are likely to experience for the
foreseeable future," Paul Martin, UK Head of Retail, KPMG, said.
