Lithuania's producer prices rose at a slower pace in December, after
accelerating in the previous month, figures from the statistical office
showed Tuesday.  
  
The industrial producer price index rose 16.3 percent year-on-year
following a 17.6 percent increase in November. In October, producer
price inflation was 16.3 percent.  
  
Excluding refined petroleum products, the producer price inflation
continued to accelerate and was 13.2 percent versus 11.7 percent in
November.  
  
Prices for products sold on the domestic market increased 27.9 percent
annually and those for the foreign market grew 7.9 percent.  
  
Excluding refined petroleum products, domestic market prices rose 23
percent and foreign market prices climbed 5.7 percent.

In December, inflation was largely driven by the 55.6 percent surge in
prices for electricity, gas, steam and air-conditioning.  
  
Compared to the previous month, the producer price index rose 0.4
percent in December after a 1.7 percent increase in November.
