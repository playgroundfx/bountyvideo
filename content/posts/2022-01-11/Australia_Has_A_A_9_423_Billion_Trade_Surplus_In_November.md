November had a merchandise trade surplus of A$9.423 billion in November,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of A$10.6 billion and down
from the downwardly revised A$10.781 billion surplus in October
(originally A$11.22 billion).

Goods and services credits (exports) rose A$691 million or 2 percent to
A$43.859 billion, driven by a rise in exports of rural goods.

Goods and services debits (imports) rose A$2.049 billion (6 percent) to
A$34.436 billion, driven by a rise in imports of primary industrial
supplies.
