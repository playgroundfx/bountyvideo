year, data from the central bank revealed on Tuesday.

The current account deficit narrowed to $2.68 billion in November from
$3.54 billion in the same period last year. The current account balance
had posted a surplus of $3.14 billion in October.

previous year and the net outflow of $3.475 billion in the goods item,
down by $385 million.

Under services, travel item recorded a net inflow of $1.55 billion, up
