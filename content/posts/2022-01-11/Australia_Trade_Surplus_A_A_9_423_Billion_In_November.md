November posted a merchandise trade surplus of A$9.423 billion in
November, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of A$10.6 billion and down
from the downwardly revised A$10.781 billion surplus in October
(originally A$11.22 billion).

Goods and services credits (exports) rose A$691 million or 2 percent to
A$43.859 billion, driven by a rise in exports of rural goods.

Exports of rural goods jumped 13 percent on month, while non-rural goods
added 1 percent. Non-Monetary gold sank 14 percent.

Goods and services debits (imports) rose A$2.049 billion (6 percent) to
A$34.436 billion, driven by a rise in imports of primary industrial
supplies.

Imports of consumption goods added 3 percent on month, while capital
goods gained 7 percent and intermediate goods also rose 7 percent. Non-
monetary gold spiked 31 percent.

Also on Tuesday, the ABS said that the value of retail sales in
Australia was up a seasonally adjusted 7.3 percent on month in November,
coming in at A$33.411 billion.

That beat expectations for an increase of 3.9 percent and was up from
4.9 percent in October.

Pent-up consumer demand combined with an extended November sales period
saw record sales in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing
(38.2 per cent), household goods retailing (11.6 per cent), department
stores (26.0 per cent) and other retailing (7.3 per cent). Consumers
brought forward Christmas spending to take advantage of sales and
minimize delivery and stock availability concerns ahead of the festive
season.

Food retailing was the only industry to fall this month, down 2.5 per
cent, continuing the post-lockdown pattern where food retailing,
including supermarkets, liquor etc. falls, while cafes, restaurants, and
takeaways rise (9.3 per cent) as households venture out again.
