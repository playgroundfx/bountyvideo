South Africa's manufacturing output dropped at a slower pace in
November, Statistics South Africa reported Tuesday.

Manufacturing output decreased 0.7 percent annually, much slower than
the 8.5 percent decline seen in October. Economists had forecast an
annual fall of 1.4 percent. This was the second consecutive decrease in
production.

At the same time, manufacturing output logged a monthly growth of 3.7
percent after falling 5.2 percent in October. Output was expected to
gain 0.3 percent.

In three months to November, manufacturing production was up 2.2 percent
from the previous three months.

The negative contributions to the annual fall was largely driven by
petroleum, chemical products, rubber and plastic products and furniture
and 'other' manufacturing.
