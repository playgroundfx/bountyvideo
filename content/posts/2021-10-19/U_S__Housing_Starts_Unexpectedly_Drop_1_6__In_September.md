A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed an
unexpected decrease in new U.S. residential construction in the month of
September.

The Commerce Department said housing starts fell by 1.6 percent to an
annual rate of 1.555 million in September from a revised rate of 1.580
million in August.

Economists had expected housing starts to inch up to a rate of 1.620
million from the 1.615 million originally reported for the previous
month.

The report also showed building permits plunged by 7.7 percent to an
annual rate of 1.589 million from a revised rate of 1.721 million in
August.

Building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, were expected
to drop to a rate of 1.680 million from the 1.728 million originally
reported for the previous month.
