Indonesia central bank left its key rates unchanged for the eighth
consecutive meeting on Tuesday.

The board of governors of Bank Indonesia decided to hold the the BI
7-Day reverse repo rate at 3.50 percent. The previous change in the rate
was a quarter-point reduction in February.

The deposit facility rate was maintained at 2.75 percent and the lending
facility rate at 4.25 percent.

The decision was in line with the need to maintain stability in the
exchange rate and financial system, amidst low inflation forecasts and
efforts to support economic growth.

The economic growth is projected to continue to improve until the fourth
quarter so that the whole of 2021 will remain within the range of Bank
Indonesia's projection at 3.5 percent-4.3 percent.

The bank said the current account deficit will be lower than previously
estimated to be in the range of 0.0 percent-0.8 percent of GDP in 2021,
and will remain low in 2022.

The bank forecast inflation to be below the midpoint of its target range
of 2-4 percent this year and stay within the target range of 2-4 percent
in 2022.

Although the central bank kept its growth forecast unchanged, the bank
was much more upbeat about the economic outlook, noting that strong
exports and a rebound in consumption should help support growth, Gareth
Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

That said, rate hikes are a long way off. A further reason not to expect
rate hikes is the weakness of inflation, Leather noted.

The economist expects the central bank to leave rates unchanged not just
until the end of this year, but until the end of 2022 as well.
