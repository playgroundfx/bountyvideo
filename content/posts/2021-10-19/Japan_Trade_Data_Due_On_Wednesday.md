Japan will on Wednesday release September figures for imports, exports
and trade balance, highlighting a modest day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

Imports are expected to surged 34.4 percent on year, slowing from 44.7
percent in August. Exports are called higher by an annual 11.0 percent,
down from 26.2 percent in the previous month. The trade deficit is
pegged at 519.2 billion yen following the 635.4 billion yen shortfall a
month earlier.

Australia will see September results for the leading economic index from
Westpac; in August, the index dipped 0.3 percent on month.

Taiwan will provide September numbers for export orders, with forecasts
suggesting a jump of 17.0 percent after rising 17.6 percent in August.

China will see September data for house prices; in August, the house
price index was up 4.2 percent on year.
