Hungary's central bank raised its interest rates in October, as signaled
in previous months, for a fifth [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session in a row amid concerns
over rising inflation and upside risks to the outlook.

The Monetary Council decided to raise the central bank base rate by 15
basis points to 1.80 percent, the Magyar Nemzeti bank said in a
statement.

The previous change in the rate was a similar size hike in September.  
  
Policymakers also considered the need for a 15-basis point increase in
the interest rate corridor. Consequently, the overnight deposit rate was
hiked to 0.85 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised
lending rates were increased to 2.75 percent.  
  
"In the decision-makers' assessment, the inflation outlook continues to
be surrounded by upside risks which might prove to be more persistent
than earlier expected," the MNB said.

"For this reason, the Council considers it necessary to continue the
monthly interest rate tightening cycle."  
  
Policymakers will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the
outlook for inflation stabilizes around the central bank target in a
sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the
horizon of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the central bank added.
