German economic confidence weakened further in April but at a slower-
than-expected pace, survey results from the ZEW - Leibniz Centre for
European Economic Research showed on Tuesday.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell to -41.0 in April from
-39.3 in March. However, economists had forecast the index to decline
more sharply to -48.0.

The assessment of the economic situation worsened significantly in
April. The corresponding indicator declined to -30.8 from -21.4 in the
previous month. The expected score was -35.0.

This was the second time the indicator has recorded a decrease since the
start of the war in Ukraine.

The survey showed that inflation expectations for Germany fell by 43.4
points to a new value of 26.8 points.

The experts are pessimistic about the current economic situation and
assume that it will continue to deteriorate, ZEW President Achim
Wambach, said.

The decline in inflation expectations, which cuts the previous month's
considerable increase by about half, gives some cause for hope, Wambach
added. However, the prospect of stagflation over the next six months
remains.

Experts' sentiment concerning the economic development of the eurozone
also deteriorated in April. The confidence index slid 4.3 points to
-43.0 points. The situation indicator fell to a new level of -28.5
points, dropping 6.6 points compared to the previous month.

Inflation expectations for the currency bloc declined 43.6 points in the
current survey.

Data released earlier in the day showed that Germany's consumer price
inflation hit its highest level since the reunification. Inflation rose
to 7.3 percent from 5.1 percent in February.
