The UK unemployment declined in three months to February and job
vacancies rose to a new record high, the Office for National Statistics
said Tuesday.

The jobless rate fell 0.2 percent points from the previous quarter to
3.8 percent in three months to February. The rate came in line with
expectations.

At the same time, the employment rate was largely unchanged at 75.5
percent, but remained below the pre-pandemic level.

The number of job vacancies rose to a new record 1,288,000 in January to
March period. However, the rate of growth in vacancies continued to slow
down.

In March, payrolled employment showed a small monthly growth of 35,000
to a record 29.6 million, data showed.

Average earnings including bonuses, grew 5.4 percent annually in three
months to February. Excluding bonus, average earnings was up 4.0
percent. Both rates matched economists' expectations.
