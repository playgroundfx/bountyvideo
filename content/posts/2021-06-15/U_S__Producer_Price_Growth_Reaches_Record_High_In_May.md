A report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed producer
prices in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the month of May,
with the annual rate of growth reaching a record high.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand
advanced by 0.8 in May after climbing by 0.6 percent in April.
Economists had expected another 0.6 percent increase.

Energy prices jumped by 2.2 percent in May after tumbling by 2.4 percent
in April, while food prices spiked by 2.6 percent after surging up by
2.1 percent in the previous month.

Excluding prices for food, energy, and trade services, core producer
prices rose by 0.7 in May, matching the increase seen in the previous
month. Core prices were expected to rise by 0.5 percent.

The report said prices for services climbed by 0.6 percent for the
second straight month amid a 1.9 percent surge in prices for
transportation and warehousing services.

Compared to the same month a year ago, producer prices in May were up by
6.6 percent, reflecting the largest increase since 12-month data were
first calculated in November 2010.

The annual rate of core producer price growth also accelerated to a
record high of 5.3 percent in May from 4.6 percent in April.

"Looking past the noise, producer price increases will slow as supply
constraints relax and reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)te to demand in the second half of 2021,"
said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

He added, "With inflation expectations cooling and fiscal stimulus
fading, we continue to share the Fed's view that we are not entering an
environment of spiraling prices."

Last Thursday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
consumer prices in the U.S. increased by more than expected in the month
of May.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.6 percent
in May after climbing by 0.8 percent in April. Economists had expected
consumer prices to increase by 0.4 percent.

About one-third of the increase in consumer prices was due to a 7.3
percent spike in prices for use cars and trucks. Food prices also rose
by 0.4 percent, while energy prices were unchanged.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices climbed by 0.7
percent in May following a 0.9 percent advance in April. Core prices
were also expected to rise by 0.4 percent.

The continued increase in core prices reflected the jump in prices for
used cars and trucks as well as increases in prices for household
furnishings and operations, new vehicles, airline fares, and apparel.

The report also showed consumer prices in May were up by 5.0 percent
compared to the same month a year ago, reflecting the biggest spike
since August of 2008.

The annual rate of core consumer price growth also accelerated to 3.8
percent in May, which represents the biggest jump since June of 1992.
