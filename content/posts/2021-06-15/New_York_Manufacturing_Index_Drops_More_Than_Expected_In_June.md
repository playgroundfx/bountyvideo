New York manufacturing activity expanded at a slower rate in the month
of June, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York on Tuesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index fell to
17.4 in June from 24.3 in May, although a positive reading still
indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to dip to 22.0.

Looking ahead, the New York Fed said firms remained optimistic that
conditions would improve over the next six months, with the index for
future employment reaching a record high.
