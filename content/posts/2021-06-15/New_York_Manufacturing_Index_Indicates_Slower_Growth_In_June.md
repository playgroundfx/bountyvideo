New York manufacturing activity expanded at a slower rate in the month
of June, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York on Tuesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index fell to
17.4 in June from 24.3 in May, although a positive reading still
indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had
expected the index to dip to 22.0.

The bigger than expected decrease by the headline index reflected
substantial slowdowns in the pace of growth in both new orders and
shipments.

The new orders index tumbled to 16.3 in June from 28.9 in May, while the
shipments index plunged to 14.2 from 29.7.

The number of employees index also edged down to 12.3 in June from 13.6
in May, indicating a modest slowdown in the pace of job growth.

The price indexes also retreated from last month's record highs, with
the prices paid index falling to 79.8 in June from 83.5 in May and the
prices received index sliding to 33.3 from 37.1.

Meanwhile, the report said the delivery times index jumped to a record
high of 29.8 in June from 23.6 in May, pointing to significantly longer
delivery times.

Despite the slowdown in the pace of growth in June, the New York Fed
said firms remained optimistic that conditions would improve over the
next six months.

The index for future business conditions spiked to 47.7 in June from
36.6 in May, with the index for future employment reaching a record
high.

"Healthy goods demand, rising business investment and reviving global
activity will keep U.S. manufacturing advancing at a solid clip through
the rest of 2021," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

On Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed is scheduled to release its report on
regional manufacturing activity in the month of June. The Philly Fed
Index is expected to edge down to 31.0 in June from 31.5 in May.
