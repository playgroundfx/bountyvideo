The UK unemployment rate dropped in the three months to April, as
businesses increased hiring in response to the easing of restrictions
related to the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, official data revealed
Tuesday.

The unemployment rate dropped 0.3 percentage points quarterly to 4.7
percent in three months to April, the Office for National Statistics
reported. The rate came in line with economists' expectations.

At the same time, the employment rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 75.2
percent. The ONS said the latest estimates continued to show signs of
recovery in the labor market.

The number of payrolled employees increased for the sixth consecutive
month, up by 197,000 in May to 28.5 million.

The recent relative calm is unlikely to last and the remaining months of
2021 are likely to be turbulent for the UK jobs market, James Smith, an
ING economist, said.

Unemployment is set to rise come the end of the furlough scheme in
September,  
although the spike will be considerably less pronounced than it might
have been had support ended earlier, the economist noted.

Annual growth in average employee pay has continued to increase.
However, this was driven by compositional effects of a fall in the
number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs, the ONS said.

Average earnings including bonus grew 5.6 percent annually in three
months to April, well above economists' forecast of 4.9 percent.
Likewise, excluding bonus, earnings were up 5.6 percent versus the
expected rate of 5.3 percent.

The level of employment is still well below its pre-crisis level and
underlying wage growth is much weaker than the headline number,
suggesting there is still plenty of slack in the labor market, Thomas
Pugh, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The slack in the labor market will prevent a big rise in underlying pay
putting upward pressure on inflation, Pugh noted.

In May, claimant count dropped 92,600 from the previous month, data
revealed. The claimant count rate fell to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent
in April.

The number of job vacancies in March to May was 758,000, only 27,000
below the level before the coronavirus pandemic in January to March
2020.
