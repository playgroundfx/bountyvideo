Germany's harmonized inflation accelerated for a third month in a row to
its highest level in nearly three years and remained above the European
Central Bank's target of 'below, but close to 2 percent' in May, final
data from Destatis confirmed on Monday.

The harmonized index of consumer prices rose 2.4 percent year-on-year in
May, which was faster than the 2.1 percent increase in April. The rate
was the highest since October 2018, when it was 2.6 percent.  
  
The consumer price index rose 2.5 percent annually after a 2.0 percent
increase in April. Headline inflation accelerated for a fifth month in a
row and was the highest since September 2011, Destatis said.

Energy product prices rose 10.0 percent after a 7.9 percent gain in the
previous month. Excluding energy prices, inflation was 1.8 percent in
May.  
Food price inflation slowed to 1.5 percent from 1.9 percent. Service
costs rose 2.2 percent.  
  
On a monthly basis, the harmonized index of consumer prices gained 0.3
percent in May. The CPI rose 0.5 percent.

All flash estimates were confirmed.
