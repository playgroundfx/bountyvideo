Partly reflecting a sharp pullback in auto sales, the Commerce
Department released a report on Tuesday showing retail sales in the U.S.
tumbled by more than expected in the month of May.

The report said retail sales plunged by 1.3 percent in May following an
upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase in April.

Economists had expected retail sales to slump by 0.8 percent compared to
the unchanged reading originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail sales still
slid 0.7 percent in May after coming in unchanged in April. Ex-auto
sales were expected to inch up by 0.2 percent.
