A report released by the Federal Reserve on Thursday showed U.S.
industrial production increased by more than expected in the month of
May after a downwardly revised uptick in the previous month.

The Fed said industrial production climbed by 0.8 percent in May after
inching up by a revised 0.1 percent in April.

Economists had expected industrial production to rise by 0.6 percent
compared to the 0.5 percent increase that had been reported for the
previous month.

The bigger than expected increase in industrial production came as
manufacturing production advanced by 0.9 percent in May after edging
down by 0.1 percent in April, partly reflecting a large gain in motor
vehicle assemblies.

Mining output also jumped by 1.2 percent in May after falling by 0.4
percent in April, while utilities output crept up by 0.2 percent after
spiking by 1.9 percent in the previous month.

Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said the
increase in industrial production "suggests that some of the shortages
holding back production in recent months could be starting to ease."

"But the big picture is that manufacturing output is still below its
pre-pandemic peak and continues to lag well behind the earlier
resurgence in goods demand," Hunter added.

The Fed also said capacity utilization for the industrial sector climbed
to 75.2 percent in May from 74.6 percent in April. Economists had
expected capacity utilization to rise to 75.1 percent.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and mining sectors rose to
75.6 percent and 75.2 percent, respectively, while capacity utilization
in the utilities sector was unchanged at 72.8 percent.
