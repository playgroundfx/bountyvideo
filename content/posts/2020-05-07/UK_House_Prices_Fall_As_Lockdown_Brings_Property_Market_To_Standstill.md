UK house prices declined for the second straight month in April as the
property market came to a standstill after government announced lockdown
to contain spread of [coronavirus][1], data from the Lloyds Bank
subsidiary Halifax and IHS Markit showed Thursday.

House prices fell 0.6 percent on a monthly basis in April, after easing
0.3 percent in March.

On a yearly basis, house price growth eased to 2.7 percent in three
months to April from 3 percent in three months to March. Quarter-on-
quarter, house prices advanced 0.7 percent.

With market activity currently almost at a complete standstill, the
limited number of transactions available means that calculating average
house prices has inevitably become more challenging, Russell Galley,
managing director, Halifax, said.

This will lead to a great deal of volatility until more data becomes
available, Galley added.

"The future remains uncertain and based on our current forecasting we
expect short term headwinds to house prices, although we maintain our
underlying confidence in the [health][2] of the housing market in the
longer term," said Galley.
