China's exports expanded in April despite the global outbreak of
[coronavirus][1], or covid-19, pandemic hurting global demand, data from
the General Administration of Customs revealed Thursday.

In dollar [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), exports grew 3.5 percent on a yearly basis in April,
confounding expectations for a decline of 12.1 percent. Shipments had
declined 6.6 percent in March.

Meanwhile, imports plunged 14.2 percent on year versus the expected fall
of 12.4 percent and March's 0.9 percent drop.

Consequently, the trade balance showed a surplus of $45.34 billion in
April, which was well above economists' forecast of $9.7 billion. The
surplus increased sharply from $19.9 billion in March.

However, Purchasing Managers' survey from IHS Markit on Thursday showed
that China's new export orders in the service sector fell at the second-
sharpest rate since the series began in September 2014 as many firms
commented that the pandemic had resulted in temporary company closures
and other restrictions across many export [markets][2].

The service sector logged further falls in [business][3] activity and
new work in April but rates of reduction eased from February. The
services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 44.4 in April from 43.0 in
March. But a score below 50 indicates contraction.

The composite output index, which combines manufacturing and services,
advanced to 47.6 in April from 46.7 in the previous month.

The second shockwave for China's [economy][4] brought about by shrinking
overseas demand should not be underestimated in the second quarter,
Zhengsheng Zhong, chairman and chief economist at CEBM Group, said.

"In April, the severe export shock on China's economy had a knock-on
impact on household income and consumption, as well as business
investment," Zhong said.

Zhong noted that as the recovery of domestic consumption was limited and
increased infrastructure spending was not enough to offset the plunge in
external demand, the country's economy continued to decline year-on-
year.

The International Monetary Fund, in April, said China, where the
Covid-19 pandemic started, is forecast to grow a moderate 1.2 percent
this year, but rebound with a growth surge of 9.2 percent next year.
