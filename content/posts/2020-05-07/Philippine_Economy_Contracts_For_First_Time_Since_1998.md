The Philippine [economy][1] contracted for the first time since 1998 as
coronavirus containment measures weighed heavily on investment and
shipments, official data showed Thursday.

Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent on a yearly basis in the first
quarter, in contrast to fourth quarter's revised 6.7 percent expansion,
the Philippine Statistics Authority reported.

This was the first decline since the fourth quarter of 1998. GDP was
expected to grow 3.1 percent.

On a quarterly basis, the economy shrank 5.1 percent in the first
quarter.

The contraction in the first quarter suggests that the lockdown is
having a severe impact on economic activity and that growth is likely to
be even worse than feared in 2020, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

The expenditure side of GDP showed that gross capital formation plunged
18.3 percent.  
  
Exports and imports decreased 3.0 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, household consumption and government expenditure posted
positive growths of 0.2 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively.

Containing the spread of the virus and saving hundreds of thousands of
lives through the imposition of enhanced community quarantine has come
at a great cost to the Philippine economy, Acting Economic Planning
Secretary Karl Chua reportedly said.
