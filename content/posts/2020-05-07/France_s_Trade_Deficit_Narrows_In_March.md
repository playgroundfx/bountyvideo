France's trade deficit narrowed sharply in March as the decline in
imports outpaced the fall in exports as [coronavirus][1] containment
measures dampened domestic and foreign demand, the French customs office
said on Thursday.

The trade deficit fell to EUR 3.34 billion in March from EUR 5.03
billion in February.

Exports declined 16.7 percent on a monthly basis to EUR 35.19 billion
and imports plunged 18.5 percent to EUR 38.54 billion.

On a yearly basis, exports and imports decreased 8.4 percent and 7.9
percent, respectively.

Elsewhere, data from Bank of France showed that the current account
deficit widened sharply in the first quarter.

The current account deficit totaled EUR 10.1 billion versus EUR 2.1
billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The goods deficit increased by EUR 2.3 billion despite the reduction in
the energy bill. The services surplus, which stood at EUR 4.4 billion,
was strongly impacted by the EUR 3.5 billion deterioration in the travel
balance.

Primary income also showed a marked decline, firstly due to the downward
revision of estimates of direct investment income. The shortfall in
primary and secondary income was EUR 0.6 billion.

In March, the current account deficit was EUR 3.3 billion.
