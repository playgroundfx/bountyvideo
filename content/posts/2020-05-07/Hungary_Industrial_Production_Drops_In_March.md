Hungary's industrial production declined for the first time in three
months in March, data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office
showed on Thursday.

Industrial production dropped a working-day adjusted 10.0 percent year-
on-year in March, after a 1.5 percent increase in February.

The economic effects caused by the Covid-19 were already significant in
this period, the agency said.

On a non-adjusted basis, industrial production decreased 5.6 percent
annually in March, after a 3.8 percent rise in the preceding month.

A significant fall was observed in the manufacture of transport
equipment, while the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical
products slightly grew, the agency said.

Meanwhile, the rate of growth accelerated in the manufacture of food
products, beverages and tobacco products.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production fell 10.4 percent
monthly in March, following a 0.1 percent decrease in the prior month.
