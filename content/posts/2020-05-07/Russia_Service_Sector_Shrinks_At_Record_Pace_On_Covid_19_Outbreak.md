Russia's service sector contracted at a record pace in April due to the
restrictions imposed to curb the spread of [coronavirus][1], survey data
from IHS Markit showed on Thursday.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 12.2 in April from 37.1
in March. This was the steepest deterioration since the survey began in
October 2001. Any score below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.

Output declined as client demand slump in April following the
implementation of emergency public [health][2] measures. Some firms
noted that their ability to operate decreased due to lockdown and
quarantine procedures.

New [business][3] received fell steeply in April as customers cancelled
or postpone orders due to lockdown. New orders declined the most in the
survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) with foreign client demand contracting sharply.

New export orders decreased at the fastest pace since September 2014,
amid an upswing of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Firms' expectation towards business activity over the next 12 months
remained negative in April. The degree of confidence rose slightly from
March, but was the second slowest in the survey [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

New business inflow lowered in April which led to greater spare capacity
in the start of the second quarter. This led to the reduction in the
employment level at a record pace.

The level of outstanding business declined at the sharpest pace in
eighteen-and-a-half-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

On the price front, cost burden rose at a solid rate that was the second
fastest since July last year. This was due to cost associated with the
transition to work from home and negotiating logistical challenges
during Covid-19 pandemic.

Output charges decreased at the fastest rate since October 2009, as an
effort to retain client and attract new customers.

The composite output index declined to 13.9 in April from 39.5 in March
due to contraction in the manufacturing and services sectors. This was
the sharpest contraction since the survey began in October 2001.

"The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak had a hugely detrimental effect on
the Russian services sector, as lockdowns and other emergency public
health measures imposed operational challenges for service providers,"
Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, said.

"In line with negative expectations among private sector firms, we
currently forecast a 3.6% contraction in GDP in 2020," Jones added.
