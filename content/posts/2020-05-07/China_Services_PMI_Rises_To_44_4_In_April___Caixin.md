The services sector in China continued to contract in April, albeit at a
slightly slower pace, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Thursday
with a Services PMI score of 44.4.

That's up from 43.0 in March, although it remains beneath the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, total new work fell at a modest rate, although export
sales tumbled at a near-record pace. Companies trimmed their staff
numbers for the third month in a row.

The survey also showed that the composite index ticked up to 47.6 in
April from 46.7 in March.
