German industry's production expectations are now at their lowest level
since reunification in 1990 and they expect a historic collapse in
output, due to the adverse impact of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19,
the think tank ifo said Thursday.

The corresponding ifo index for the next three months plunged to minus
51.4 in April from minus 21.4 in March, ifo said. In December 2008, amid
the global financial crisis, the index reading was minus 42.9.  
  
The 30 points decline in April was worse than the 22.7 points fall in
March.  
  
"German industry is expecting an unprecedented slump in its production,"
ifo said.

The slump in production is getting deeper and deeper, the head of the
Ifo survey, Klaus Wohlrabe said.

"Only the manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are optimistic about
the future," he added.
