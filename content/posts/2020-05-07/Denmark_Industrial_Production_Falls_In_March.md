Denmark's industrial production fell in March after rising in the
previous month, figures from Statistics Denmark showed on Thursday.

Industrial production fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent month-on-
month in March, after a 2.4 percent rise in February. In January, output
decreased 4.2 percent.

The latest decline cannot be directly related to COVID-19 and its
consequences, as the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 were first
announced on March 11 and, relative to other professions, only affected
the industry to a lesser extent, the agency said.

That said, confidence indicators suggest that industry expects a sharp
decline in production in the coming months, the agency added.

Production fell in eight out of twelve sub-industries in March. The
largest decline was in the transportation industry, by 13.0 percent. The
biggest contribution to the overall decline came from the metal
industry, which fell by 7.6 percent.

Production in pharmaceutical industry rose 3.6 percent in March, and
furniture and other industries increased 7.8 percent.

In the first quarter, industrial production fell 0.5 percent compared to
the previous three months.

Industrial turnover declined 0.4 percent monthly in March and fell 2.1
percent in the first quarter.
