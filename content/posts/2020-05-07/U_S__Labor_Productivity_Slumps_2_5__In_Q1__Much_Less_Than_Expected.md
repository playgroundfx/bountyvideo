A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. labor
productivity pulled back by much less than expected in the first
quarter.

The Labor Department said labor productivity slumped by 2.5 percent in
the first quarter after jumping by 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter of
2019. Economists had expected productivity to plunge by 5.5 percent.

The decrease in productivity, a measure of output per hour came as
output plummeted by 6.2 percent compared to a 3.8 percent slump in hours
worked.

Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, noted the
steeper drop in output was partly because the employment numbers for
March are based on the monthly survey taken around the 12th of the
month, whereas the output numbers include all of March.

"That makes a big difference when most lockdowns only began around the
middle of that month," Ashworth said.

He added, "We might even see a rise in the average level of productivity
during this recession, because the job losses have been concentrated in
low-productivity sectors like retail and food services, which account
for much bigger shares of total employment than GDP."

Meanwhile, the report said unit labor costs skyrocketed by 4.8 percent
in the first quarter after climbing by 0.9 percent in the fourth
quarter. Labor costs had been expected to surge up by 4.0 percent.

The spike in labor costs in the first quarter reflected the pullback in
productivity as well as a 2.2 percent jump in hourly compensation.

Real hourly compensation, which takes into account changes in consumer
prices, climbed by 0.9 percent in the first quarter.
