The Bank of England maintained its key interest rate and refrained from
unveiling additional quantitative easing, despite the [coronavirus][1],
or covid-19, pandemic taking its toll on the [economy][2].

The nine-member monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee voted unanimously to maintain
the bank rate at a record low 0.1 percent. The bank had altogether
reduced the rate by 65 basis points at two unscheduled meetings in March
to combat risks posed by coronavirus to the economy.

The committee voted by a majority of 7-2 to continue with the programme
of GBP 200 billion of UK government bond and sterling non-financial
investment-grade corporate bond purchases, to take the quantitative
easing to GBP 645 billion.

Two members sought an increase in the target for the stock of asset
purchases by an additional GBP100 billion.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers judged that the existing stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
appropriate.  
In the Monetary Policy Report, the bank said covid-19 is dramatically
reducing jobs and incomes in the economy.

The fall in output has been large and consumer spending has declined
sharply. But the disruption will be temporary, the bank noted.

As the social distancing measures are lifted, the economy will recover.
