France industrial and manufacturing output declined sharply in March as
the spread of [coronavirus][1], or covid-19, disrupted functioning of
factories and supply chains, data from the statistical office Insee
showed Thursday.

Another report from Insee showed that manufactures are forecasting
investment to fall more than previously projected this year largely due
to lower investment in the transport equipment.

Industrial production plunged 16.2 percent month-on-month, in contrast
to February's 0.8 percent rise. Output was expected to fall 12.4 percent
in March.

Likewise, manufacturing output declined 18.2 percent after rising 0.9
percent a month ago.

The monthly fall was largely driven by a 35.9 percent decrease in
transport equipment production and 34.3 percent fall in refined
petroleum products output.

Mining and quarrying output decreased 4.1 percent, while construction
output logged a sharp reduction of 40.1 percent in March.

In the first quarter, industrial output was down 5.6 percent and
manufacturing decreased 6.1 percent from the previous quarter.

Business managers forecast investment to drop 7 percent in nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
in 2020, the Insee said in a separate communique. Industrialists
downgraded their January estimate by 10 points. They have estimated
investment to grow 3 percent in 2019.

At the end of the first quarter, private sector payroll employment
dropped 2.3 percent or 453,800 job losses, as a result of crisis caused
by coronavirus pandemic, flash data from Insee showed.

On a yearly basis, employment decreased 1.4 percent, which was -274,900.
It returned to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2017, Insee
said.

Excluding temporary workers, payroll employment fell 0.9 percent or
-162,000 jobs. Temporary employment fell considerably by 37.0 percent
compared to the end of 2019.
