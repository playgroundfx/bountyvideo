Norway's central bank cut its key interest rate unexpectedly to zero on
Thursday and suggested that it is set remain at this level for some time
ahead as the economic outlook is clouded with high uncertainty due to
the impact of the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic.  
  
The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate was cut to zero from 0.25 percent in a unanimous
decision. Economists had expected the bank to leave the rate unchanged.

In March, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate was lowered from 1.5 to 0.25 percent.  
  
Norges Bank expects the low interest rates to support faster rebound in
economic activity and hopes that they may reduce the risk of
unemployment becoming entrenched at a high level.  
  
"In the Committee's current assessment of the outlook and balance of
risks, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will most likely remain at today's level for some
time ahead," Norges Bank Governor Oystein Olsen said.  
  
"We do not envisage making further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate cuts", Olsen said.
