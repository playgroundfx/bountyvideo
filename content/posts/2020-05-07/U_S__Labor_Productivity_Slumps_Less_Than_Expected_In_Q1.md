A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. labor
productivity pulled back by much less than expected in the first
quarter.

The Labor Department said labor productivity slumped by 2.5 percent in
the first quarter after jumping by 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter of
2019. Economists had expected productivity to plunge by 5.5 percent.

Meanwhile, the report said unit labor costs spiked by 4.8 percent in the
first quarter after climbing by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Labor
costs had been expected to surge up by 4.0 percent.
