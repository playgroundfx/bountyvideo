European Central Bank Vice-President Luis de Guindos and Governing
Council member Gabriel Makhlouf said separately on Thursday that the
central bank was more determined to support the euro area [economy][1]
during crisis periods and the bank stands ready to adjust all tools at
its disposal, just days after the top German court ruled that the bank's
government debt purchases were in violation of its mandate.  
  
"We remain more determined than ever to ensure supportive financial
conditions across all sectors and countries to allow this unprecedented
shock to be absorbed," de Guindos said in his introductory statement,
while presenting the Annual Report in the European Parliament.  
  
"We continue to stand ready to make further adjustments to our monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures should we see that the scale of the stimulus is falling
short of what is needed."

ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker and governor of the Irish central bank, Makhlouf said in
an interview to Radio One that the German court ruling was not going to
have any effect on the ECB's actions.  
  
"We are determined to respond forcefully to the challenges and to do
whatever it takes to deliver our mandate," he said.  
  
"It [German court ruling] looks as if it runs counter to what the
European Court of Justice indicated just over a year ago but the ECB
itself acts very transparently," the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker said.  
  
Their remarks come just days after the German Constitutional Court ruled
that the ECB acted beyond its power when it bought government debt worth
more than EUR 2.1 trillion under its Public Sector Purchase Programme
that ran from 2015 to 2018.  
  
The court gave the ECB three-months time to explain why such a stimulus
measure was necessary and to assess if it was proportional. If the ECB
fails to give a satisfactory response in the given time, the court asked
Bundesbank and the German government to withdraw from asset purchases
under ECB scheme.  
  
The latest flash estimate from Eurostat showed that the euro area
economy contracted by 3.8 percent quarterly in the first quarter of 2020
that only partially reflected the impact of the lockdowns imposed to
slow the [coronavirus][2], or Covid-19, pandemic.  
  
Citing consumer and [business][3] sentiment indicators for April, de
Guindos said their sharp decline suggest an even larger contraction in
the second quarter.

The ECB Staff has projected that Eurozone GDP could fall this year
between 5 percent in a mild scenario and 12 percent in a severe
scenario.  
  
Makhlouf said the worst case scenario of 12 percent contraction in the
euro area GDP seemed more "realistic".  
  
Inflation is expected to fall much further in the coming months, given
the current oil price expectations.  
  
"In this unprecedented environment, the decisive and targeted [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
measures the ECB has taken since early March have provided crucial
support to the euro area economy, notably to those sectors most exposed
to the crisis," de Guindos said.  
  
"They support ample liquidity conditions, protect the smooth flow of
credit to households and businesses, and preserve favorable financing
conditions for all sectors and countries."

De Guindos also stressed that it was important that fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) played
its role in supporting the economy and thus, complement monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
