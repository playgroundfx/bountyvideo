Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the [coronavirus][1]
pandemic has less-than-estimated pressure on inflation.

"The consequences for cost pressures over the medium term - and
therefore for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) - are probably limited," the banker said.

"But this divergence in demand may help to explain why, at least on
impact, the pandemic has depressed inflation by a bit less than we and
others anticipated when it began," added Broadbent.

The banker concluded that the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) committee would need firm
evidence of a significant narrowing in spare capacity, and of a
sustainable return of inflation to the 2 percent target, before
considering whether to withdraw any of this stimulus.

Further, he said GDP is likely to have fallen in the fourth quarter of
2020 and to do so again in the first quarter of 2021. This will no doubt
prompt headlines about a "double-dip recession".

The rate of unemployment is the best single measure of economic slack,
he noted. The unemployment is expected to rise once the furlough schemes
are wound down.
