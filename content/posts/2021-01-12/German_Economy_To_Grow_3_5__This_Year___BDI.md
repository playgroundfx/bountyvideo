Germany's [economy][1] is set to expand this year on the back of export
growth, but the biggest euro area economy will reach pre-crisis level
only in the first half of next year, Federation of German Industries/BDI
said Tuesday.  
  
The industry body predicted 3.5 percent growth for the German economy
this year. GDP shrunk around 5 percent in 2020 as the [coronavirus][2]
pandemic and subsequent lockdowns hurt economic activity severely.  
  
Exports are expected to grow 6 percent after an 11 percent slump last
year.  
  
"A return to the pre-crisis level will therefore not be achieved in the
current year," BDI President Siegfried Russwurm said.

"But there should be a good chance that it will succeed in the first
half of 2022."
