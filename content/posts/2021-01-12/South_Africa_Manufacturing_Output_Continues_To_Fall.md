South Africa's manufacturing output continued to decline in November,
data from Statistics South Africa showed on Tuesday.

Manufacturing output fell 3.5 percent year-on-year in November,
following an 3.4 percent decline in October.

The biggest negative contribution came mainly from petroleum, chemical
products, rubber and plastic products, food and beverages, and basic
iron and steel, non-ferrous metal products, metal products and
machinery.

On a month-on-month basis, manufacturing output fell 1.3 percent in
November, after a 3.2 percent growth in the preceding month. Economists
had expected a 0.3 percent rise.

During the three months ended in November, manufacturing output gained
8.9 percent, after a 17.4 percent increase in the preceding period.
