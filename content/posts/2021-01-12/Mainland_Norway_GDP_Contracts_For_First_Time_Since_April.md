The Mainland Norway [economy][1] contracted in November for the first
time in seven months due to the virus-related restrictions, Statistics
Norway reported Tuesday.

Gross domestic product fell 0.9 percent month-on-month in November,
reversing a 1.2 percent rise in the previous month. This was the first
decline since April. GDP was forecast to fall 1.4 percent.

The smaller-than-expected fall in mainland Norwegian GDP in November
shows that activity was reasonably resilient to tighter virus-related
restrictions and was well placed coming into 2021, Melanie Debono, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that household consumption fell
1.4 percent, while general government expenditure remained flat.

At the same time, gross fixed capital formation declined 2.2 percent.
Exports slid 2.6 percent on month. On the other hand, imports grew 3
percent.

Total GDP for Norway, including oil and gas extraction, transport via
pipelines and ocean transport, dropped 0.1 percent in November,
following a 0.7 percent decrease in October.
