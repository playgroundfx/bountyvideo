The European Central Bank on Thursday stuck to its earlier announcements
to wind down monetary stimulus and charted out a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization
plan, which economists said was gradual and hawkish.  
  
The Governing Council, led by ECB President Christine Lagarde, called
the Russian invasion of Ukraine "a watershed for Europe" and expressed
full support to the people of Ukraine.  
  
The bank said it will ensure smooth liquidity conditions and implement
the sanctions decided by the EU and governments.

The ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers revised the purchase schedule for its asset
purchase program, or APP, for the coming months and now sees monthly net
purchases to total EUR 40 billion in April, EUR 30 billion in May and
EUR 20 billion in June.

In February, the bank had said that the monthly net purchases will be
EUR 40 billion in the second quarter and EUR 30 billion in the third
quarter.  
  
The bank said on Thursday that if the incoming data support the
expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook will not weaken even
after the end of asset purchases, the Governing Council will conclude
net purchases under the APP in the third quarter.

Earlier, the ECB had said asset purchases will continue at a monthly
pace of EUR 20 billion from October.  
  
"If the medium term inflation outlook changes and if financing
conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards our two per
cent target, we stand ready to revise our schedule for net asset
purchases in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of size and/or duration," the ECB said.  
  
The bank also reiterated that it intends to continue reinvesting the
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for
an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key
ECB interest rates and for as long as necessary.  
  
The Governing Council left its key interest rates unchanged. The main
refinancing rate thus remains at zero, the deposit rate at -0.50 percent
and the marginal lending rate at 0.25 percent.  
  
"Any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time
after the end of the Governing Council's net purchases under the APP and
will be gradual," the bank said. Earlier, the ECB had said rates will be
raised 'shortly after' the end of asset purchases.

The bank said it expects "the key ECB interest rates to remain at their
present levels until it sees inflation reaching two percent..that
realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be
consistent with inflation stabilizing at two per cent over the medium
term."

The ECB thus revised its forward guidance on interest rates and no
longer sees interest rates to go lower from their present levels.  
  
The bank reiterated its December decision that it will discontinue
purchasing assets under its Covid-19 pandemic stimulus scheme at the end
of March.  
  
The EUR 1,850 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP,
was launched in March 2020 to support the euro area [economy][1] and
financial system amid the risks posed by the disruptions caused by the
coronavirus pandemic.  
  
The bank also reiterated its December decision to extend the
reinvestment horizon for the PEPP to until at least the end of 2024.  
  
Stressing that flexibility will remain an element of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
the ECB said net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if
necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.

Citing the highly uncertain environment caused by the Russian invasion
of Ukraine and the risk of regional spillovers that could adversely
affect euro area financial [markets][2], the ECB decided to extend the
Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) until 15 January
2023.  
  
"The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as
appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2 percent target
over the medium term," the ECB said.  
  
Given the stagflation risk and high uncertainty, this decision gives the
central bankÂ maximum flexibility and keeps the option open for a rate
hike before year-end, ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.  
  
Capital Economics economist Andrew Kenningham said the latest ECB
statement was more hawkish statement than expected and suggests that
there may be a longer gap between ending QE, perhaps in July, and first
raising interest rates.
