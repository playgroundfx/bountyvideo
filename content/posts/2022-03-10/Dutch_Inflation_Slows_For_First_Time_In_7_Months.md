The Netherlands' consumer price inflation slowed for the first time in
seven months in February, mainly due to smaller rise in energy prices.  
  
The consumer price index rose 6.2 percent year-on-year following a 6.4
percent increase in the previous month, preliminary data from the
Central Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday.

Inflation slowed for the first time since July.  
  
Prices in the utilities group rose 3.01 percent annually after a 3.36
percent increase in the previous month.  
  
The price development of mobile phones also had a depressing effect on
inflation, the CBS said.  
  
Meanwhile, food inflation climbed to 4.9 percent from 4.3 percent.
Furniture prices also had an upward effect on inflation.  
  
The harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 7.3 percent
annually in February after a 7.6 percent increase in January.
