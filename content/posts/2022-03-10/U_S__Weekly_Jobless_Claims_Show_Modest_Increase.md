First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits saw a modest increase
in the week ended March 5th, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Thursday.

The report showed initial jobless claims crept up to 227,000, an
increase of 11,000 from the previous week's revised level of 216,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to tick up to 216,000 from the
215,000 originally reported for the previous week.

"Despite the rise in the latest week, we see further downside for
claims," said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead U.S. Economist at Oxford
Economics. "Layoffs are expected to be minimal in a tight labor market
with near-record job openings."

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also inched up to 231,250, an increase of 500 from the previous week's
revised average of 230,750.

Continuing claims, a reading on the number of people receiving ongoing
unemployment assistance, also rose by 25,000 to 1.494 million in the
week ended February 26th.

Meanwhile, the report showed the four-week moving average of continuing
claims fell by 31,250 to 1,506,500, hitting the lowest level since March
1970.

The Labor Department released a separate report last Friday showing
another significant increase in U.S. employment in the month of
February.

The report showed non-farm payroll employment spiked by 678,000 jobs in
February after surging by an upwardly revised 481,000 jobs in January.

Economists had expected employment to jump by 400,000 jobs compared to
the addition of 467,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

The stronger than expected job growth was led by increases in employment
in the leisure and hospitality, professional and [business][1] services,
health care, and construction sectors.

With another jump in employment, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.8
percent in February from 4.0 percent in January.

The unemployment rate, which was expected to edge down to 3.9 percent,
fell to its lowest level since hitting 3.5 percent in February of 2020.
