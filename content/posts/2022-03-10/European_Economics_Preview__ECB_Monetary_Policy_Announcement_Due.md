The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement from the European Central Bank is due
on Thursday, headlining a light day for the European economic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

Frankfurt.

Thereafter, at 9.30 am, the ECB is slated to publish macroeconomic
projections for the euro area.

At 1.00 am ET, Statistics Finland releases industrial output data for
January. Production had increased 11.5 percent annually in December.

At 2.00 am ET, consumer and producer prices from Norway and unemployment
