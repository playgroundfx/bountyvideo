The European Central Bank raised sharply the inflation forecast for this
year for the euro area and warned that economic activity would be
dampened if there would be severe impact from the Russia-Ukraine war.

In the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections unveiled by ECB
President Christine Lagarde on Thursday, the inflation outlook for this
year was lifted to 5.1 percent from 3.2 percent.

The projection for next year was raised to 2.1 percent from 1.8 percent.
The outlook for 2024 was also lifted to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent.

In the alternative scenarios for the impact of the war, the bank said
economic activity could be dampened significantly by a steeper rise in
energy and commodity prices and a more severe drag on trade and
sentiment.

"However, in all scenarios, inflation is still expected to decrease
progressively and settle at levels around our two per cent inflation
target in 2024," Lagarde said in her introductory statement to the post-
decision press conference.

While the impact of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic seems to be fading and
there are signs of easing in supply bottlenecks and improvement in the
labor market, the bank said euro area growth forecasts have been revised
down owing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The bank expects food and energy prices to climb further due to the war.

The Eurozone growth forecast for this year was lowered to 3.7 percent
from 4.2 percent. The outlook for next year was cut to 2.8 percent from
2.9 percent. The projection for 2024 was retained at 1.6 percent.

"The risks to the economic outlook have increased substantially with the
Russian invasion of Ukraine and are tilted to the downside," the bank
said.

"The same factors are risks to the outlook for inflation, which are on
the upside in the near term."

Earlier on Thursday, the bank unveiled a plan to wind down monetary
stimulus, which economists said was gradual and hawkish.

However, the bank altered its forward guidance and signaled it would
wait some time after ending asset purchases before raising interest
rates.
