The Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a continued
acceleration in the annual rate of U.S. consumer price growth in the
month of February.

The report showed the annual rate of consumer price growth accelerated
to 7.9 percent in February from 7.5 percent in January, reaching the
highest rate since January 1982.

"The Russia-Ukraine war adds further fuel to the blazing rate of
inflation via higher energy, food, and core commodity prices that are
turbo charged by a worsening in supply chain problems," said Kathy
Bostjancic, Chief US Financial Economist at Oxford Economics.

"This will lead to a higher near-term peak in inflation and a slower
descent through 2022 than previously envisaged," she added. "Our
modeling work suggests consumer prices rise closer to 6.5% on average in
2022 after a 4.7% rise in 2021."

The faster year-over-year price growth came as consumer prices climbed
by 0.8 percent in February after rising by 0.6 percent in January. The
increase in prices matched economist estimates.

The monthly advance in consumer prices was led by a spike in energy
prices, which shot up by 3.5 percent in February after climbing by 0.9
percent in January.

Food prices also showed a notable increase, jumping by 1.0 percent in
February following a 0.8 percent advance in the previous month.

Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices rose by 0.5
percent in February following a 0.6 percent increase in January. The
core price growth also matched expectations.

A 0.5 percent increase in prices for shelter contributed to the core
price growth along with higher prices for recreation, household
furnishings and operations, motor vehicle insurance, personal care, and
airline fares.

The annual rate of core consumer price growth accelerated to 6.4 percent
in February from 6.0 percent in January, showing the fastest growth
since August 1982.

Next Tuesday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on producer prices in the month of February. Economists currently
expect producer prices to increase by 0.8 percent.
