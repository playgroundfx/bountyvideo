Dutch industrial production growth eased to the lowest level in ten
months in January, figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed
on Thursday.

Industrial production rose 7.9 percent year-on-year in January, after a
13.3 percent growth in December.

The latest growth was the lowest since March last year, when output rose
3.3 percent.

More than half of all industrial [business][1] classes produced more in
January, the agency said.

Production in the machine industry grew the most, nearly 47.0 percent,
while the manufacture of transport equipment declined 10.0 percent.

On a seasonally and working-day adjusted basis, industrial production
rose 1.2 percent in January.
