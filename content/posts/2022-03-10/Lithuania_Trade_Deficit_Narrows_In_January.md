Lithuania's merchandise trade deficit narrowed in January after widening
in the previous month as imports declined faster than exports,
preliminary data from the statistical office showed Thursday.

The trade deficit shrunk to EUR 301.6 million from EUR 409.4 million in
December. In the same month last year, there was a surplus of EUR 62.2
million.

Exports decreased 6.8 percent month-on-month, led by a fall in shipments
of machinery, fertilizers, medical and veterinary equipment.

Imports fell 8.9 percent monthly in January, driven by a slump in
arrivals of machinery, automobiles and electricity.

On a year-on-year basis, exports grew 36.5 percent and imports jumped
53.9 percent in January.

Germany, Latvia, Russia, and Poland were the main destinations for
Lithuania's exports in January. Most of the country's imports also came
from these four countries, led by Russia.

The largest exports of goods of Lithuanian origin went to Germany, the
United States, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
