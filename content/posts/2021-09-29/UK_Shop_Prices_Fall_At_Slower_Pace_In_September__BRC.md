UK shop prices declined at a slower pace in September, data published by
the British Retail Consortium, or BRC, showed on Wednesday.  
  
The shop price index dropped 0.5 percent on a yearly basis in September
after easing 0.8 percent in August.

"There are now clear signs the months-long cost pressures from rising
transport costs, labour shortages, Brexit red-tape, and commodity costs
are starting to filter through to consumer prices," Helen Dickinson,
chief executive at BRC, said.

Food prices edged up 0.1 percent and non-food prices were down 1 percent
annually.

Food prices rose for the first time in six months and some non-food
products, such as DIY & gardening, are seeing the highest rate of
inflation since summer 2018, Dickinson noted.

Whilst non food retailers have so far able to mitigate a lot of the
impact, the outlook is for shop price inflation to return over the next
few months, Mike Watkins, head of Retailer and Business Insight,
NielsenIQ, said.
