UK households' overall perception about financial wellbeing weakened in
the third quarter despite the rise in household income from employment,
data published by IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The Scottish Widows household finance index fell to 44.0 in the third
quarter from 44.7 in the second quarter.

Despite fading in the third quarter, the pace of decline remained slower
than at any other time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a
far cry from the spring of 2020, Markit said.

The index regarding the financial outlook also declined in the third
quarter, to 49.2 from 50.3 in the previous quarter.

The survey revealed that the pandemic has led to changes in long-term
financial planning when it comes to supporting their families. Almost
three quarters of households considered preparing for the future
financial wellbeing of loved ones in other generations to be important.

For the first time since the first quarter of 2020, households' income
from employment rose over the quarter. Business activity also continued
to rise steeply.

The combination of rising activity and greater incomes led some
households to take an optimistic view with regards to job security.

The survey showed that the amount of cash households have available to
spend has declined further in the third quarter. Rising living costs
have partly offset increased employment income.

As a result, household savings declined at the fastest rate since the
end of 2020, with only the highest earners recording a rise over the
third quarter.

UK households registered a sustained fall in demand for unsecured
credit, such as overdrafts and credit cards, with the decrease the
strongest on record.
