Germany's import price inflation accelerated to the highest since 1981
due to higher energy prices, data published by Destatis revealed on
Wednesday.

Import prices grew 16.5 percent on a yearly basis in August, after
rising 15 percent in July. Economists had forecast an annual growth of
16.1 percent.

This was the highest annual rate seen since September 1981, when prices
were up 17.4 percent.

Month-on-month, import prices were up 1.4 percent, following a 2.2
percent rise in July. Prices were forecast to grow 1.2 percent.

Destatis said energy imports were 93.6 percent more expensive than in
August last year. Excluding crude oil and mineral oil products, import
prices advanced 13.8 percent.

Data showed that export price inflation rose to 7.2 percent from 6.3
percent in July. This was also the biggest annual rate since September
1981.

On a monthly basis, export prices grew 0.7 percent, but slower than the
1.2 percent increase logged in July.
