Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on
Wednesday as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed that financial measures would be more
effective than a further rate cut.

At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting of the Bank of Thailand,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers unanimously voted to hold the key rate at 0.50 percent.

The bank had last reduced the rate by 25 basis points in May 2020.

The interest rates are likely to remain at their current level of 0.5
percent until at least the end of next year, Gareth Leather, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

The [economy][1] was projected to expand 0.7 percent and 3.9 percent in
2021 and 2022 respectively, largely unchanged from the August
projection, the central bank said in the statement.

The committee expects progress on vaccination and earlier-than-expected
relaxation of the containment measures would help support the economy in
the period ahead.  
  
Headline inflation would remain subdued in line with weak domestic
demand, the bank noted. Nonetheless, headline inflation forecast and
medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.
