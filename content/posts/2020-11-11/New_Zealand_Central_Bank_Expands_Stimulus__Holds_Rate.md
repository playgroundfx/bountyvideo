The Reserve Bank of New Zealand expanded its monetary stimulus and
retained its interest rate as the economic shock caused by the pandemic
is set to remain for a prolonged period.

The Monetary Policy Committee decided to begin a Funding for Lending
Programme in December in order to reduce banks' funding costs and lower
interest rates.

The committee also decided to continue with the asset purchase programme
up to NZ$100 billion and to maintain the official cash rate at 0.25
percent.

Policymakers viewed that economic activity since the August monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) statement has proved more resilient that earlier assumed.
However, the Covid-19 shock to the [economy][1] is very large and
persistent, and inflation and employment will remain below the remit
targets for a prolonged period.

The MPC expects an ongoing increase in unemployment as the economy
adjusts. Consumer price inflation was also projected to remain at the
lower-end of the remit target range for a period, and inflation
expectations remain subdued.

Policymakers observed that the banking system is on track to be
operationally ready for negative interest rates by year end. The
committee agreed that it was prepared to lower the interest to provide
additional stimulus if required.

The economic scarring from the pandemic should be enough for the Bank to
cut next year even if a vaccine has started rolling out, Ben Udy, an
economist at Capital Economics said.

As the bank reconfirmed its earlier guidance that rates would remain on
hold until March 2021, the economist pencilled in a 50 basis point cut
to -0.25 percent at the April meeting.

In a separate statement, the bank said it is further delaying the start
of increases in bank capital until 2022 to allow banks continued
headroom to respond to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and to
support the economic recovery.
