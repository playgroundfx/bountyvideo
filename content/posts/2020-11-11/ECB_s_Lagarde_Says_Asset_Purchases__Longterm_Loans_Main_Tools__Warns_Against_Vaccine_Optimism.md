Policymakers are set to favor asset purchases and longer term loans at
cheaper rates to support the euro area [economy][1] during the crisis
caused by the coronavirus, or Covid-19, pandemic, European Central Bank
President Christine Lagarde hinted on Wednesday, after she clearly
signaled late last month that the bank is set to unveil fresh monetary
stimulus in December.

She also cautioned against high optimism regarding a vaccine against the
[coronavirus][2].

"While all [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are on the table, the PEPP and TLTROs have proven
their effectiveness in the current environment and can be dynamically
adjusted to react to how the pandemic evolves," Lagarde said in an
introductory speech at ECB's forum on central banking.

"They are therefore likely to remain the main tools for adjusting our
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)."

The ECB's annual event is usually held in the Portuguese town Sintra,
while this year it is being held virtually due to the pandemic.

The pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP, was first launched
in March with a size of EUR 750 billion, which was increased in June to
EUR 1.350 trillion. Asset purchases under this scheme are set to run at
least until June 2021.

The targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTROs, were first
deployed in June 2014. The third round was TLTRO III was announced in
March 2019 and its [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) were eased in March this year as the pandemic
broke out in Europe.

On Monday, pharmaceutical company Pfizer and a German biotech firm
BioNTech announced that the vaccine they have developed is over 90
percent successful in preventing the disease.

"While the latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on a vaccine looks encouraging, we could still
face recurring cycles of accelerating viral spread and tightening
restrictions until widespread immunity is achieved," the ECB chief said.  
  
"So the recovery may not be linear, but rather unsteady, stop-start and
contingent on the pace of vaccine roll-out."

Output in the services sector may struggle to fully recover, in the
interim, Lagarde added.  
  
Lagarde drew attention to the strong resurgence of the coronavirus that
has forced Germany and France, among others, to return to lockdowns.

The second wave of COVID-19 presents new challenges and risks, but the
blueprint for managing it is the same, she said.  
  
"The ECB was there for the first wave and we will be there for the
second wave," she said.
