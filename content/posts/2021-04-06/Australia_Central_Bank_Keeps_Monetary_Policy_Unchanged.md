Australia's central bank maintained its interest rate as well as bond
purchase programme on Tuesday, as widely expected, as these measures
continued to help the [economy][1] by keeping financing costs very low.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to leave its cash rate unchanged at a record low of
0.10 percent.

The central bank retained the target yield on the 3-year Australian
government bond at around 0.1 percent and also maintained the parameters
of the Term Funding Facility and the government bond purchase programme.

The bank said the initial A$100 billion government bond purchase program
is almost complete and the second A$100 billion program will commence
next week.

Beyond this, the bank is prepared to undertake further bond purchases if
doing so would assist with progress towards the goals of full employment
and inflation, the bank said.

The RBA signaled that the interest rate will not be raised until 2024.

"The Board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is
sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. For this to occur,
wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently,"
the bank said.

This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a
tight labor market. The board does not expect these conditions to be met
until 2024 at the earliest, RBA added.

Regarding housing market, the bank said it will be monitoring trends in
housing borrowing carefully and it is important that lending standards
are maintained amid rising housing prices and low interest rates.
