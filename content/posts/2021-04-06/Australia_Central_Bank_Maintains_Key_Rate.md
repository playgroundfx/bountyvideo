Australia's central bank left its current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) settings unchanged on
Tuesday, as widely expected.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) board of the Reserve Bank of Australia headed by Governor
Philip Lowe decided to retain its cash rate at a record low of 0.10
percent.

The central bank retained the target yield on the 3-year Australian
government bond at around 0.1 percent and also maintained the parameters
of the Term Funding Facility and the government bond purchase programme.

The bank said the initial A$100 billion government bond purchase program
is almost complete and the second A$100 billion program will commence
next week.

"The Board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is
sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. For this to occur,
wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently,"
the bank said.

This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a
tight labor market. The board does not expect these conditions to be met
until 2024 at the earliest, RBA added.
