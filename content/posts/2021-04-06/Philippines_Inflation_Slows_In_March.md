The Philippines' inflation eased in March, data from the Philippine
Statistics Authority showed on Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 4.5 percent annually in March, after a 4.7
percent increase in February. Economists had expected a 4.8 percent
rise.

The slowdown in inflation was mainly due to the lower increment in the
heavily-weighted food and non-alcoholic beverages by 5.8 percent.

Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco grew 12.1 percent and those
of furnishing, household equipment and routine maintenance rose 1.9
percent.

Prices for communication and restaurant, and miscellaneous goods and
services gained 0.2 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.

Core inflation, which excludes prices of selected food and energy items,
remained unchanged at 3.5 percent in March.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices remained unchanged in March, after a
0.2 percent increase in the prior month.
