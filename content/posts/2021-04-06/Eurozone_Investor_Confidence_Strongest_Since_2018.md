Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence reached its strongest level in more than
two years in April as lockdowns in many euro area countries had little
effect on the overall economic recovery, survey data from Sentix showed
on Tuesday.

The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index rose sharply to 13.1 in April from 5.0 in
March. This was the highest level since August 2018 and well above
economists' forecast of 7.5.

Although the Eurozone [economy][1] recently lagged significantly behind
the global trend, it started to catch up in April, the survey revealed.

The current situation values jumped by 12.8 points to -6.5 in April,
reaching a level that prevailed before the corona crisis. At the same
time, the expectations index rose to an all-time high of 34.8 from 32.5
in the previous month.

The large gap between expectations and the current status is slowly
closing, Sentix noted.

The economic recovery process is supported by a massive expansion of
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the think tank said. Investors even expect the fiscal
impulse to expand.

In Germany, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence index came in at 20.0 in April, the
highest since August 2018, from 11.9 in March.

The current situation indicator climbed to +4.5 from -9.5 a month ago.
The expectations indicator gained moderately to 36.8 from 35.8.

At 26.8, the global [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment index reached its highest level
since February 2018.
