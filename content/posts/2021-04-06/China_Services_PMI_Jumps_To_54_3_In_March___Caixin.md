The services sector in China continued to expand in March, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Tuesday with a PMI
score of 54.3.

That's up from 51.5 in February, and it moves further above the boom-or-
but line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, [business][1] activity and sales both rose at quicker
rates, while employment returned to growth. Business confidence hit its
highest mark in more than a decade amid hopes for a post-pandemic
recovery.

In order to alleviate pressure on margins, prices charged by services
companies in China rose again at the end of the first quarter. The rate
of inflation was the quickest seen in the year to date and solid.

Also, the composite index climbed from 51.7 in February at 53.1 in
March.
