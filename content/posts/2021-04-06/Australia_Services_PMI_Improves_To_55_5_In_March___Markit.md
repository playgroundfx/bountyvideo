The services sector in Australia continued to expand in March, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics revealed on
Wednesday with a services PMI score of 55.5.

That's up from 53.4 in February, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, there were further gains in activity and new
[business][1], as well as sustained expansion in employment levels.

Business confidence regarding the outlook for activity over the coming
year remained at high levels. While the degree of optimism was the
softest since August 2020, expectations for an expansion remained
marked. Positive sentiment was underpinned by sustained improvements in
business conditions as the pandemic receded.

The survey also showed that its composite index climbed to 55.5 in March
as well - up from 53.7 a month earlier.
