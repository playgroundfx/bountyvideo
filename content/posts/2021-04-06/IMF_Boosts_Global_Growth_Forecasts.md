The International Monetary Fund raised its global growth projections for
this year and next, citing huge fiscal stimulus in some big economies
and a vaccine-driven recovery in the future.

The world [economy][1] is set to grow 6.0 percent this year and 4.4
percent next year, the global lender said in its latest World Economic
Outlook report, released Tuesday.

In a January update to the WEO, the IMF had projected growth of 5.5
percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. The latest projections are also
stronger than those in the October WEO report.

"The upward revision reflects additional fiscal support in a few large
economies, the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half
of 2021, and continued adaptation of economic activity to subdued
mobility," the IMF said.

"High uncertainty surrounds this outlook, related to the path of the
pandemic, the effectiveness of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support to provide a bridge to
vaccine-powered normalization, and the evolution of financial
conditions."
