Driven by a sharp rise in manufacturing output, Germany's private sector
continued to expand in September, albeit at a slower pace, survey
results from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The composite output index dropped more-than-expected to 53.7 in
September from 54.4 in August.

The expected reading was 54.1. Nonetheless, a score above 50 indicates
expansion.

The survey showed a continued loss of momentum in the recovery from the
covid-19 shutdown. Following increases in each of the previous two
months, the service sector shrank in September.

The flash services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.1 from 52.5 a
month ago. The reading was forecast to rise to 53.0.

Meanwhile, the manufacturing PMI rose to a 26-month high of 56.6 from
52.2 in August. Economists had forecast the index to climb to 52.5.
