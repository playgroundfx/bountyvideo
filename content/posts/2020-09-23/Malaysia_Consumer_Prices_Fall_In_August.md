Malaysia's consumer prices fell in August, data from the Department of
Statistics showed Wednesday.

Consumer prices declined 1.4 percent year-on-year in August, following a
1.3 percent decrease in July. Economists had expected a 1.2 percent
decrease.

The annual fall was largely driven by the decline in transportation
cost.

Prices for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels declined 3.0
percent yearly in August. Prices for transportation and furnishing,
household equipment and routine household maintenance fell by 9.9
percent and 0.1 percent, respectively.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in August.

During the January to August period, consumer prices fell 1.0 percent
from the same period last year.
