economic activity.

At the meeting, the bank voted 8-1 to retain the interest rate at -0.1
percent on current accounts that financial institutions maintain at the
central bank. The bank will also continue to purchase necessary amount
of Japanese government bonds without setting an upper limit so that
10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent.
