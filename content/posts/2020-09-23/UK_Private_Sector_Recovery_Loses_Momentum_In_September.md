The UK private sector growth eased in September due to the persistent
disruptions to [business][1] operations caused by the coronavirus
pandemic, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed Wednesday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply composite
output index fell to 55.7 in from 59.1 in the previous month. The score
was forecast to fall moderately to 56.3.

The slowdown reflected weaker rises in both manufacturing production and
service sector activity.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 55.1, down from 58.8
a month ago and below economists' forecast of 56.0.

Likewise, the manufacturing PMI declined to 54.3 in September from 55.2
in the prior month. The expected reading was 54.1.

"The indication from the survey that growth momentum is quickly lost
when [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support is withdrawn underscores our concern over the path
of the labour market once the furlough scheme ends next month, and
raises fears that growth could fade further as we head into the winter
months, especially as lockdown measures are tightened further," Chris
Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

It now seems likely that the new restrictions will set back the economic
recovery and cause GDP to stagnate in the fourth quarter, Thomas Pugh,
an economist at Capital Economics, said. The big risk is that the
government has to go further.

New business volumes across the private sector increased at the weakest
pace for three months in September.

Employment numbers continued to decrease at a sharp pace in September as
the forthcoming closure of the government's furlough scheme had
accelerated decision-making on staffing levels.

On the price front, the survey revealed a renewed fall in average prices
charged by private sector firms.

Companies also pointed to another drop in business expectations for the
year ahead, with the degree of optimism falling to its lowest since May.
