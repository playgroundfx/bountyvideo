Singapore's consumer prices continued to fall in August, data from the
Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry
sowed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in August, same
as seen in June. Economists had expected a 0.5 percent decline.

This fall in the CPI was largely due to a smaller decline in private
transport costs.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.3 percent annually in August, following a 0.4 percent
decrease in the preceding month.

The latest decline can be attributed to smaller declines in the costs of
services, retail & other goods and electricity & gas.

The statistical office expects external sources of inflation to remain
benign in the coming quarters, amid weak global demand condition. Oil
prices would remain low for a long period, while international food
prices rises amid imporved supply chain condition, the agency said.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average between -1 percent and 0 percent in 2020, the statistical office
and MAS said.
