Taiwan's retail sales rose for a second straight month in August,
official data showed on Wednesday.

Retail sales grew 8.17 percent year-on-year following a revised 2.79
percent increase in July.

Automobile sales jumped 33.5 percent. Sales at non-specialized stores
rose 5.7 percent, led by a 15.6 percent gain at convenience stores.

Online and mail-order sales increased 16.4 percent. Sales of fuel and
related products decreased 14.9 percent.

Sales of food and beverage services grew 2 percent year-on-year in
August. Wholesale trade sales edged up 0.1 percent, largely hurt by a 17
percent decline in the textile and clothing segment.
