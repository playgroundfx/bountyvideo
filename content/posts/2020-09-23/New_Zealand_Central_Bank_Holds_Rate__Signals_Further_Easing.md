New Zealand central bank central bank left its key rate and asset
purchase programme unchanged on Wednesday but agreed to provide
additional stimulus as the outbreak of the [coronavirus][1] in August
has dented confidence among firms and households.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand decided
to hold its key Official Cash Rate at 0.25 percent and to continue with
the Large Scale Asset Purchase Programme up to NZ$100 billion.

Policymakers assessed that further monetary stimulus would be needed
going forward. They affirmed that the Funding for Lending Programme, or
FLP, a negative OCR, and purchases of foreign assets remain under
consideration.

The Committee agreed that these instruments can be mutually supportive
in bolstering economic activity. Members said that the alternative
instruments can be deployed independently, and noted that the FLP would
be ready before the end of this [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) year.

Further, members viewed that deploying an FLP before the forward
guidance period for holding the OCR ends could provide additional
stimulus to the [economy][2] sooner.

The bank is expected to cut the OCR into negative territory early next
year, Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

But the economist observed that given that the market has almost fully
priced on expectation of a further 50 basis points of easing, negative
rates are unlikely to drive much of a weakening in the New Zealand
dollar.

Although the outbreak of Covid-19 in New Zealand appeared to be
contained, the coronavirus pandemic and associated travel restrictions
could have a significant long-term negative impact on the economy.

House prices had advanced recently but some [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers noted that low
population growth and rising unemployment are expected to constrain
further house price increases.

The committee said the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will need to provide significant
economic support for a long time to come to meet the inflation and
employment remit, and promote financial stability.
