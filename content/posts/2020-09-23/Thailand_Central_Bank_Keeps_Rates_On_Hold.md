Thailand's central bank left its key rate unchanged at a record low on
Wednesday as the previous monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing continued to support
the economic recovery.

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank of Thailand unanimously voted to
retain the interest rate at 0.50 percent. The bank had reduced the rate
by 25 basis points in May.

The MPC reiterated that it stands ready to use additional appropriate
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools if necessary.

"The Committee viewed that the extra accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) since
the beginning of the year as well as the fiscal, financial, and credit
measures additionally announced helped alleviate adverse impacts, and
would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided,
facilitate the return of inflation to the target, and reduce financial
stability risks," the bank said in a statement.

Policymakers said the [economy][1] would contract slightly less than
previously estimated this year but the pace of recovery next year would
be slower.

According to MPC, average headline inflation would be less negative in
2020 than the previous assessment on the back of increasing energy
prices as demand rose after the relaxation of Covid-19 containment
measures.

Having left interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent despite the bleak
outlook, further cuts seem unlikely, Gareth Leather, an economist at
Capital Economics, said. One option that has been mentioned before by
the BoT is a programme of quantitative easing, but impact is likely to
be small.
