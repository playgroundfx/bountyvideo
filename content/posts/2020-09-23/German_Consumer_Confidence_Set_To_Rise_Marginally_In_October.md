German consumer confidence is set to rise slightly in October, survey
data from the market researcher GfK showed Wednesday.

The forward-looking consumer sentiment index rose to -1.6 in October
from -1.7 in September.

Despite rising infection figures and the increasing fear of tighter
restrictions caused by the pandemic, the consumer climate has
stabilized, Rolf Burkl, GfK consumer expert said.

"The further course of the infection rate in Germany and the situation
in the labor market will decide whether the previous month's downturn
remains a flash in the pan and whether consumer mood is able to recover
in the coming months."

While economic and income expectations were on the rise, propensity to
buy has taken a hit.

Consumers assessed that the largest euro area [economy][1] is clearly on
the road to recovery. The economic expectations index gained 12.4 points
to 24.1 in September.

A stable labor market and the falling number of short-time workers
supported the rising economic optimism.

The income expectations index rose 3.3 points to 16.1 in September. In
contrast to income expectations, the propensity to buy stalled after
four consecutive rises. The indicator dropped by 5.3 points to 38.4.

The survey was conducted between September 2 and 14.
