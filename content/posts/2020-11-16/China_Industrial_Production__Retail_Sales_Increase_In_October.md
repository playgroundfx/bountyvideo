China industrial production and retail sales logged robust growth in
October as the [economy][1] shrugged off the negative impact of
Covid-19, data revealed Monday.  
  
Industrial production grew at a steady pace of 6.9 percent annually in
October, the National Bureau of Statistics said. This was faster than
the expected increase of 6.5 percent.

Retail sales advanced 4.3 percent on year in October, better than
September's 3.3 percent increase but slower than the economists'
forecast of 4.9 percent.

During January to October period, fixed asset investment grew 1.8
percent from the same period last year versus the expected increase of
1.6 percent.

The unemployment rate fell marginally to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent in
the previous month. The rate came in line with economists' expectations.

The economic growth is expected to be faster in the fourth quarter, Fu
Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, told
reporters.

Driven by domestic consumption and global demand for medical equipments,
the economy had expanded 4.9 percent on a yearly basis in the third
quarter.

The International Monetary Fund had upgraded China's growth projection
for this year to 1.9 percent from 1 percent. Growth is forecast to zoom
to 8.2 percent in 2021.

Policy stimulus continued to boost investment and industrial output
while growth in real retail sales and services activity returned to pre-
virus levels, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at
Capital Economics, said.

The upshot is that the negative shock to the labor market and service
sector from Covid-19 now appears to have fully reversed.

As consumption still has room to strengthen further in the near-term and
supportive fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) keeping activity in industry and construction
strong, the economists expect a period of above-trend economic growth in
the coming quarters.
