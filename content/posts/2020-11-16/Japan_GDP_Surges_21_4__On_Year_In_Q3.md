for a gain of 4.4 percent following the 8.2 percent slide in the second
quarter.

Capital Expenditure was down 3.4 percent on quarter, missing forecasts
for a drop of 3.0 percent after sinking 4.5 percent in the three months
prior.

GDP private consumption gained 4.7 percent on quarter, missing
expectations for 5.1 percent after falling 3.1 percent in Q2.
