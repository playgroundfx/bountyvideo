The service sector in New Zealand continued to expand in October, and at
a faster rate, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Tuesday
with a Performance of Service Index score of 51.4.

That's up from 50.4 in September and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, new orders and stocks expanded last month, while sales,
employment and supplier deliveries remained in contraction.

"October's PSI was still shy of its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average of 54.0. This was
perhaps more disappointing than was the case for the PMI as the service
sectors should arguably have been exhibiting a stronger rebound," said
BNZ Senior Economist Craig Ebert.
