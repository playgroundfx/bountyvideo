The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its November 3 monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, highlighting a light day for
Asia-Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the RBA decided to lower its key cash rate by 15 basis
points to a record low of 0.10 percent. It also decided to cut the
target for the yield on the 3-year Australian Government bond to around
0.1 percent and to purchase A$100 billion government bonds of maturities
of around 5 to 10 years over the next six months.

Singapore will provide October trade data, with non-oil exports expected
to rise 4.6 percent on month and 5.7 percent on year after slipping 11.3
percent on month and gaining 5.9 percent on year in September. The trade
surplus in the previous month was SGD3.04 billion.

Hong Kong will see October numbers for unemployment; in September, the
jobless rate was 6.4 percent.
