Australia is likely to see an extended period of higher unemployment due
to the pandemic, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said
Monday.

Addressing higher unemployment is an important national priority, he
observed.

Easing of Covid-19 restrictions and good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on a vaccine could help
the [economy][1] to rebound, he said. There is considerable uncertainty
about the outlook.

Lowe said over the past decade or so, there have been signs that the
economy was becoming less dynamic.

If businesses are to seize the opportunities that are out there to grow
and to increase Australia's productive capital base, some degree of
risk-taking is necessary, Lowe said.

Further, he observed that there has been a sharp decline in population
growth due to the pandemic. "If population growth is to be noticeably
slower in a post-COVID world, the trajectory for our economy will look
different too."
