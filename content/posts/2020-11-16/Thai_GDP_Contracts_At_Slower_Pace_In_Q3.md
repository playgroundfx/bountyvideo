Thailand's [economy][1] shrank at a slower pace in the third quarter
driven by the easing of Covid-19 control measures though travel
restrictions continued to dampen the tourism sector, official data
showed on Monday.

Gross domestic product fell by less-than-expected 6.4 percent on a
yearly basis in the third quarter, slower than the 12.1 percent decline
posted in the second quarter, the National Economic and Social
Development Council, or NESDC, reported.

GDP was expected to shrink 8.6 percent. Nonetheless, with the third
consecutive contraction, the economy remained under recession.

On a quarterly basis, GDP logged its biggest growth in more than eight
years. GDP expanded 6.5 percent, in contrast to a 9.9 percent fall in
the preceding period.

Economists had forecast a moderate growth of 3.8 percent. The latest
pace of expansion was the fastest since the first quarter of 2012, when
GDP was up 9.4 percent.

The government raised its GDP forecast for 2020 to -6 percent from -7.3
to -7.8 percent estimated previously.

Next year, the economy is projected to grow within the range of 3.5 -
4.5 percent underpinned by improving domestic demand, the recovery in
domestic and global trade and economic stimulus, the agency said.

It is expected that export values of goods, private consumption
expenditure, and total investment will increase by 4.2 percent, 2.4
percent, and 6.6 percent, respectively.  
  
GDP figures showed that the worst is now over for Thailand's economy,
but its dependence on tourism means it is likely to experience one of
the slowest recoveries in the region, Gareth Leather, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

The economist noted that the nation appears to have eliminated the
virus. Social distancing is unlikely to be a drag on growth going
forward. Loose fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will also help support the
recovery, Leather added.

On the expenditure-side, data showed that private consumption
expenditure dropped only 0.6 percent due to the easing of lockdown
measure and domestic travel restriction, coupling with the
implementation of government policies.

Meanwhile, government consumption expenditure grew 3.4 percent in the
third quarter. At the same time, investment decreased 2.4 percent due to
a 10.7 percent fall in private investment.

Exports of goods and services plunged 23.5 percent and imports declined
20.3 percent.  
  
The government projected headline inflation in the range of 0.7 - 1.7
percent and the current account tends to register a surplus of 2.6
percent of GDP in 2021.
