The German [economy][1] rebounded in the summer but it is unlikely to
continue in the fourth quarter due to the recent resurgence of the
pandemic, Bundesbank said in its monthly report on Monday.

Despite the very strong growth, overall economic performance in the
third quarter was still 4 percent below the pre-crisis level of the
final quarter of 2019.

The experts assessed that the catching-up movement will not continue in
the final quarter of 2020 for the time being due to the recent
resurgence of the pandemic in Germany and in neighboring European
countries, as well as the additional containment measures , the central
bank said.

Nonetheless, as the measures restricted economic life far less than in
March and April, a similarly severe slump as in spring is not very
likely.

Moreover, the bank noted that the international production conditions
have so far hardly been affected despite the very high number of new
infections throughout Europe.
