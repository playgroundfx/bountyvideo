Japan's gross domestic product contracted an annualized 3.9 percent on
year in the first quarter of 2021, the Cabinet Office said in Tuesday's
final reading.

That exceeded expectations for a decline of 4.8 percent following the
11.7 percent surge in the three months prior.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was down 1.0 percent - again beating forecasts
for a decline of 1,2 percent following the 2.8 percent increase in the
previous three months.

Capital expenditure was down 1.2 percent on quarter, matching
expectations following the 4.3 percent gain in the previous quarter.
