rise in April. Economists had forecast shipment to grow 26 percent.

Parts of electronic product exports advanced 29.6 percent and shipment
of information, communication and audio-view products increased 28.8

At the same time, annual growth in imports advanced to 40.9 percent from
26.4 percent in the previous month, while the rate was expected to slow

The trade surplus totaled $6.16 billion in May, which was above the
