Japan's gross domestic product shrank an annualized 3.9 percent on year
in the first quarter of 2021, the Cabinet Office said in Tuesday's final
reading.

That exceeded expectations for a decline of 4.8 percent following the
11.7 percent surge in the three months prior.

On a quarterly basis, GDP was down 1.0 percent - again beating forecasts
for a decline of 1,2 percent following the 2.8 percent increase in the
previous three months.

Capital expenditure was down 1.2 percent on quarter, matching
expectations following the 4.3 percent gain in the previous quarter.

External demand was down 0.2 percent on quarter after rising 1.1 percent
in the previous three months, while private consumption dropped 1.5
percent on quarter after gaining 2.2 percent three months earlier.

The GDP price index was down 0.1 percent on year after rising 0.2
percent in the three months prior.

Also on Tuesday:

• The Ministry of Finance said that Japan posted a current account
surplus of 1,321.8 billion yen in April. That missed expectations for a
surplus of 1,500.6 billion yen following the 2,650.1 billion yen surplus
in March.

Exports were up 38.0 percent on year at 6,825.5 billion yen and imports
gained an annual 11.3 percent at 6,536.0 billion yen for a trade surplus
of 289.5 billion yen.

\The capital account showed a surplus of 3.4 billion yen, while the
financial account saw a shortfall of 242.7 billion yen.

• The Bank of Japan said that overall bank lending in Japan was up 2.9
percent on year in May, standing at 578.366 trillion yen. That follows
the 4.8 percent increase in April.

Excluding trusts, bank lending gained an annual 2.2 percent to 501.954
trillion yen, slowing from the 4.3 percent expansion in the previous
month.

Lending from trusts climbed 7.5 percent on year to 76.411 trillion yen
after rising 8.3 percent a month earlier. Lending from foreign banks
rose 2.5 percent on year to 3.381 trillion yen, up from 1.2 percent in
April.
