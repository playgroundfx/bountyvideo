Latvia's consumer price inflation accelerated sharply in May,
preliminary data from the statistical office showed Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 2.6 percent year-on-year following a 1.7
percent increase in April.  
  
Prices rose for a third straight month.  
  
In May, inflation was mainly influenced by the rise in prices of goods
and services related to transport, food and non-alcoholic beverages,
recreation and culture, [health][1] care, alcoholic beverages and
tobacco products, clothing and footwear.

Prices in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group increased 0.9
percent. Clothing and footwear prices rose 2.6 percent. The health care
group prices grew 3.0 percent.  
  
The transport group prices increased 11.4 percent, driven by a 29.5
surge in prices of automotive fuel. Prices in the recreation and culture
segment rose 3.0 percent.

Compared to the previous month, prices climbed 0.5 percent after a 0.4
percent fall in April.
