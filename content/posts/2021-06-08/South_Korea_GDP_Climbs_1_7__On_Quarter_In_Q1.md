on Wednesday.

That follows the downwardly revised 1.1 percent increase in the previous
three months (originally 1.2 percent).

On a yearly basis, GDP was up 1.9 percent following the upwardly revised
1.1 percent decline in the three months prior (originally -1.2 percent).

Real gross national income (real GNI) increased by 2.4 percent in the
first quarter compared to the previous quarter.
