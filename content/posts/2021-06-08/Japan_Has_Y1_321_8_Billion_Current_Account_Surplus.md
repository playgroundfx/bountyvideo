Japan posted a current account surplus of 1,321.8 billion yen in April,

That missed expectations for a surplus of 1,500.6 billion yen following
the 2,650.1 billion yen surplus in March.

Exports were up 38.0 percent on year at 6,825.5 billion yen and imports
gained an annual 11.3 percent at 6,536.0 billion yen for a trade surplus
of 289.5 billion yen.

The capital account showed a surplus of 3.4 billion yen, while the
financial account saw a shortfall of 242.7 billion yen.
