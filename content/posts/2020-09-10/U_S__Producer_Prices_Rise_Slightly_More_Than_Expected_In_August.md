the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Thursday.

by 0.3 percent in August after climbing by 0.6 percent in July.
Economists had expected prices to edge up by 0.2 percent.

Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices increased by 0.4
percent in August following a 0.5 percent advance in July. Core prices
were also expected to tick up by 0.2 percent.
