UK house prices increased at the strongest pace since 2016 as almost all
regions logged price increases, survey data from the Royal Institution
of Chartered Surveyors, or RICS, showed Thursday.

The house price balance rose to +44 percent in August, the highest
reading since 2016, from +13 percent registered in July. The expected
balance was +25 percent.  
  
This marked a dramatic turnaround compared to the reading of -33 percent
registered back in May. The agency said virtually all parts of the UK
are now seeing prices increase to a greater or lesser degree. London was
the only exception.

Enquiries, sales and new instructions all continued to rise firmly in
August, the survey showed.

The pandemic was expected to cause a lasting shift in the desirability
of certain property characteristics, as 83 percent of respondents
anticipate demand increasing for homes with gardens over the next two
years.  
  
A net balance of 63 percent of contributors reported an increase in
buyer interest during August. Further, about 46 percent of participants
said new instructions being listed onto the sales market continued to
rise.

A strong growth in agreed sales was cited for a third successive month,
with a net balance of +61 percent of contributors seeing a pick-up.
