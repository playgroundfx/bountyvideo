Malaysia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged on Thursday
as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed that the previous easing continue to provide
stimulus to the [economy][1].

The Monetary Policy Committee of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to retain
the overnight [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 1.75 percent.

The central bank had last reduced its rate by 25 basis points in July.

Given the outlook for growth and inflation, the MPC considered that the
stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to be appropriate and accommodative, the bank
said in a statement.

While the economy is rebounding, there is still a strong case for more
easing, Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, said. The
economist expects one more 25 basis point rate cut at the last meeting
of the year in November, followed by a further 50 basis points of easing
in 2021.

According to central bank, headline inflation will average negative in
2020 given the substantially lower global oil prices, and average higher
in 2021. Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued amid spare
capacity in the economy.

Policymakers observed that labor market conditions, household
consumption and trade continued to improve, underpinned by fiscal
stimulus and monetary easing.

Looking ahead, the improvement is expected to continue into 2021,
supported by the recovery in external demand and expansion in private
sector expenditure, the bank said.  
  
But the MPC cautioned that the outlook is still subject to downside
risks, particularly from ongoing uncertainties surrounding the course of
the pandemic domestically and globally.
