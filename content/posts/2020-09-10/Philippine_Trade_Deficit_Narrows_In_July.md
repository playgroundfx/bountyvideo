The Philippine trade deficit narrowed in July from the last year, the
Philippine Statistics Authority showed Thursday.

Exports declined 9.6 percent on a yearly basis, but slower than the 12.5
percent decrease seen in June. This was the fifth consecutive decrease
in shipments.

At the same time, imports plunged 24.4 percent versus a 23.1 percent
drop in June.

As a result, the trade deficit narrowed to $1.83 billion from $3.64
billion in the same period last year. In June, the deficit was $1.37
billion.

Among major commodity groups, gold showed the biggest fall in exports
value, which was down by 41.6 percent. Data showed that exports of
electronic products continued to be the country's top export with total
earnings of $3.35 billion. But exports decreased 2.6 percent.
