First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits came in unchanged in
the week ended September 5th, the Labor Department revealed in a report
on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims came in at 884,000, unchanged
from the previous week's revised level. Economists had expected jobless
claims to drop to 846,000 from the 881,000 originally reported for the
previous week.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
fell to 970,750, a decrease of 21,750 from the previous week's revised
average of 992,500.

Meanwhile, the report said continuing claims, a reading on the number of
people receiving ongoing unemployment assistance, climbed by 93,000 to
13.385 million in the week ended August 29th.

The four-week moving average of continuing claims still tumbled to
13,982,000, a decrease of 523,750 from the previous week's revised
average of 14,505,750.

"The data show that despite job gains and a fall in the unemployment
rate in August, layoffs remain widespread and the labor market remains
in a fragile place at a critical juncture," said Nancy Vanden Houten,
Lead U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

She added, "Failure on the part of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers to enact another fiscal
relief package poses significant downside risks to the [economy][1] and
labor market."

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing
another substantial increase in U.S. employment in the month of August,
although the pace of job growth continued to slow from the record spike
seen in June.

The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment surged up by 1.371
million jobs in August after spiking by a downwardly revised 1.734
million jobs in July and soaring by 4.781 million jobs in June.

Economists had expected employment to jump by about 1.400 million jobs
compared to the addition of 1.763 million jobs originally reported for
the previous month.

The strong job growth in August was partly due to the hiring of 238,000
temporary 2020 Census workers, which contributed to a significant
increase in government employment.

The continued job growth contributed to a much bigger than expected drop
in the unemployment rate, which fell to 8.4 percent in August from 10.2
percent in July. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to edge
down to 9.8 percent.
