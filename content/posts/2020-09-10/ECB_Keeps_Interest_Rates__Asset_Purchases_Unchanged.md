The European Central Bank on Thursday left its key interest rates and
the size of asset purchases unchanged, as expected, and reiterated that
it stands ready to make adjustments to its tools when needed.

The main refi rate was retained at a record low zero and the deposit
rate was kept at -0.50 percent, in line with economists' expectations.

The lending rate was left unchanged at 0.25 percent.

"The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its
instruments, as appropriate," the bank reiterated.

Confirming its forward guidance on interest rates, the ECB said the
Governing Council expects the key interest rates to remain at their
present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly
converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within
its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently
reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.

The size of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) was left
unchanged at EUR 1,350 billion.

"These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in
the projected path of inflation...," the central bank said.

"This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the
smooth transmission of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)."

Asset purchases under the PEPP will continue until at least the end of
June 2021 or when the bank assess that the [coronavirus][1] crisis is
over, the ECB said.

The future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid
interference with the appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, the central
bank added.

Further, the bank said the net purchases under the asset purchase
programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of EUR 20 billion,
together with the purchases under the additional EUR 120 billion
temporary envelope until the end of the year.

The Governing Council will also continue to provide ample liquidity
through its refinancing operations, the bank said.

ECB President Christine Lagarde is set to hold her post-decision press
conference at 08:30 AM ET, during which she is set to unveil the latest
set of ECB staff macroeconomic projections.
