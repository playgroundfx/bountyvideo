Producer prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected in
the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Thursday.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose
by 0.3 percent in August after climbing by 0.6 percent in July.
Economists had expected prices to edge up by 0.2 percent.

The slightly stronger than expected price growth came despite a modest
pullback in energy prices, which edged down by 0.1 percent in August
after spiking by 5.3 percent in July.

The report showed food prices also fell by 0.4 percent in August after
declining by 0.5 percent in the previous month.

Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices climbed by 0.4
percent in August following a 0.5 percent advance in July. Core prices
were also expected to tick up by 0.2 percent.

The bigger than expected increase in core prices came as prices for
final demand services rose by 0.5 percent for the second straight month.

Prices for trade services led the way higher, jumping by 1.2 percent in
August after climbing by 0.8 percent in July.

The report showed more modest increases in prices for transportation and
warehousing and other services, which rose by 0.2 percent and 0.3
percent, respectively.

"The moderate advance in August producer prices confirms that underlying
price dynamics continue to gradually normalize," said Lydia Boussour,
Senior U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

She added, "While some see high inflation lurking around the corner, we
believe there is little scope for prices to heat up meaningfully as the
[economy][1] continues to only slowly recover from the Covid-19 crisis."

Compared to the same month a year ago, producer prices in August were
down by 0.2 percent following a 0.4 percent drop in July. Core prices
were up 0.6 percent year-over-year.

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on consumer prices in the month of August.

Economists expect consumer prices to rise by 0.3 percent in August
following a 0.6 percent increase in July. Core prices are expected to
inch up by 0.2 percent after climbing by 0.6 percent.
