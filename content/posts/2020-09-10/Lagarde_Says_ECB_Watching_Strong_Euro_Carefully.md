European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers are watching the appreciation in the euro closely for any
impact on prices, and reiterated that the bank stands ready to adjust
all its tools when needed to support the fragile economic recovery in
the euro area.  
  
The Governing Council extensively discussed the implications of a strong
euro in the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, Lagarde said in the post-decision
press conference.  
  
"We have to monitor carefully such a matter," she said. However,
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers did not see an immediate need to act on it, she added.  
  
The ECB does not target the exchange rate, Lagarde reiterated.  
  
Earlier on Thursday, the central bank left its key interest rates and
its pandemic emergency purchase programme unchanged and reaffirmed its
forward guidance.  
  
"The incoming data since our last monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting in July suggest a strong rebound in activity broadly in line with previous expectations, although the level of activity remains well below the levels prevailing before the [coronavirus][1] (COVID-19) pandemic," Lagarde said.

The strength of the recovery remains surrounded by significant
uncertainty, as it continues to be highly dependent on the future
evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies, the
ECB chief stressed.

Ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to support the economic
recovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability and hence, the
bank reconfirmed its accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, Lagarde
added.

Further, she said the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures taken since early March
are providing "crucial support" to underpin the euro area recovery and
to safeguard medium-term price stability.

"The increases in coronavirus infection rates during the summer months
constitute headwinds to the short-term outlook," Lagarde said.

During the press conference, Lagarde unveiled the latest ECB staff
macroeconomic projections that showed that the Eurozone growth forecast
for this year was revised up to -8 percent from -8.7 percent predicted
in June.  
  
The growth projection for next year was lowered slightly to 5 percent
from 5.2 percent and the outlook for 2022 was cut to 3.2 percent from
3.3 percent.  
  
The inflation projection for this year was maintained at 0.3 percent.
The projection for next year was raised to 1.0 percent from 0.8 percent
and the outlook for 2022 was left unchanged at 1.3 percent.
