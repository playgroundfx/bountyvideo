Eurozone inflation accelerated further in February to hit a fresh record
high driven by energy prices, flash estimate from Eurostat showed on
Wednesday.

Inflation advanced to 5.8 percent in February from 5.1 percent in
January. Inflation was forecast to climb to 5.3 percent.

Core inflation that excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco,
increased to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent in the previous month.

Among components of inflation, energy logged another sharp growth of
31.7 percent. This was followed by a 4.1 percent rise in food, alcohol
and tobacco prices. Non-energy industrial goods prices were up 3 percent
and services cost grew 2.5 percent.

On a monthly basis, the harmonized index of consumer prices moved up 0.9
percent. Final data is due on March 17.

Further spikes are likely in the near term due to the war in Ukraine,
but the European Central Bank is likely to refrain from clear
commitments on the monetary path next week as economic uncertainty is
massive, Bert Colijn, an ING economist, said.

After February's surprisingly strong inflation outturn and with energy
prices surging, euro-zone inflation is very likely to rise above 6
percent in the coming months, Jack Allen-Reynolds, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

It then looks set to remain well above the ECB's target for a long time,
most likely ending the year around 4 percent, the economist added.

Among big-four nations, Spain posted an annual inflation of 7.5 percent
in February and Italy's rate was 6.2 percent. Germany and France logged
5.5 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively.
