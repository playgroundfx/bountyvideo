The manufacturing sector in South Korea continued to expand in February,
and at a faster pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed on
Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 53.8.

That's up from 52.8 in January, and it moves further above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This extended the current sequence of expansion to 17 months and was the
strongest improvement since last June. February data indicated a second
successive rise in manufacturing output. The rate of expansion was
moderate and the sharpest recorded for seven months.

Manufacturers attributed the increase to stronger new order growth in
key sectors such as car production and semiconductors. At the same time,
businesses recorded a sharper rise in new orders in the latest survey
period. Panelists often commented that client confidence was supported
by the launch of new products in both domestic and international
[markets][1].
