Economic activity in the U.S. has expanded at a modest to moderate pace
since mid-January, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in each of the twelve Fed districts, noted that many
districts reported that the surge in Covid-19 cases temporarily
disrupted [business][1] activity as firms faced heighted absenteeism.

The spike in Covid-19 cases was also blamed for a temporary weakening in
demand in the hospitality sector in some districts, while severe winter
weather was also cited as disrupting activity.

The Fed noted consumer spending was subsequently generally weaker than
in the prior report, which was released in early January.

While the Beige Book said manufacturing activity continued to grow at a
modest pace, all districts noted that supply chain issues and low
inventories continued to restrain growth, particularly in the
construction sector.

The report also said employment increased at a modest to moderate pace,
although widespread strong demand for workers remained hampered by
equally widespread reports of worker scarcity.

With regard to inflation, the Beige Book said prices charged to
customers increased at a robust pace across the nation, with a few
districts reporting an acceleration in the pace of price growth.

Rising input costs were cited as a primary contributing factor across a
broad swath of industries, the Fed said. Labor cost increases and
ongoing materials shortages also contributed to higher input prices.

The release of the Beige Book comes two weeks before the Fed's next
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting on March 15-16, when the central bank is widely
expected to raise interest rates.
