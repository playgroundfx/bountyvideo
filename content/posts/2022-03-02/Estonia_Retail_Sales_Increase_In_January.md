Estonia's retail sales rose in January, data from Statistics Estonia
showed on Wednesday.

Retail sales, excluding motor vehicles and motor cycles trade, increased
8.0 percent year-on-year in January.

"The turnover growth in enterprises engaged in the retail sale of
automotive fuel accounted for nearly a half of the total rise in the
turnover of retail trade enterprises," Johanna Pihlak, analyst at
Statistics Estonia, said.

On a monthly basis, retail sales declined 20.0 percent in January, this
was mainly due to Christmas and year-end sales.

On a seasonally and working-day adjusted basis, retail sales turnover
remained unchanged monthly in January.
