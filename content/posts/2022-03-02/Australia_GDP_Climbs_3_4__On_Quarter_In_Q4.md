Australia's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 3.4
percent on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Australian Bureau
of Statistics said on Wednesday.

That beat forecasts for a gain of 3.0 percent following the 1.9 percent
contraction in the three months prior.

On a yearly basis, GDO gained 4.2 percent - again exceeding expectations
for an increase of 3.7 percent and up from 3.9 percent in the third
quarter.

Real net national disposable income rose 1.7 percent, while the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
trade fell 5.1 percent. Household saving ratio decreased to 13.6 percent
from 19.8 percent.
