While acknowledging the economic uncertainty introduced by Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated
during congressional testimony on Wednesday that the central bank is
still likely to raise interest rates later this month.

Powell told members of the House Financial Services Committee the Fed
believes it remains appropriate to raise rates at the next meeting on
March 15-16, citing inflation well above 2 percent and the strong labor
market.

"The process of removing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation in current circumstances
will involve both increases in the target range of the federal funds
rate and reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet,"
Powell said.

"As the FOMC noted in January, the federal funds rate is our primary
means of adjusting the stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," he added. "Reducing
our balance sheet will commence after the process of raising interest
rates has begun, and will proceed in a predictable manner primarily
through adjustments to reinvestments."

The likely increase in interest rates comes even though Powell
acknowledged that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has introduced significant
uncertainty for the U.S. economic outlook.

"The near-term effects on the U.S. [economy][1] of the invasion of
Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain
highly uncertain," Powell said.

"Making appropriate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in this environment requires a
recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways," he added. "We
will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving
outlook."

CME Group's FedWatch Tool currently indicates a 90.5 percent chance the
Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points later this month.
