Austria's consumer price inflation increased in February, preliminary
estimates from Statistics Austria showed on Wednesday.

Consumer prices rose 5.9 percent yearly in February, following a 5.0
percent increase in January.

"Rising fuel and energy prices are currently continuing to fuel
inflation," Tobias Thomas, director general at Statistics Austria, said.

The EU measure of harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, rose 5.5
percent annually in February, following a 4.5 percent increase in the
preceding month.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices increased 1.3 percent monthly in
February, after a 0.1 percent fall in the prior month.

On month-on-month basis, the HICP rose 1.3 percent in February, after
remaining unchanged in the previous month.
