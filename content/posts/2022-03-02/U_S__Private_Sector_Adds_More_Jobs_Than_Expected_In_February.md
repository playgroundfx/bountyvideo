Payroll processor ADP released a report on Wednesday showing U.S.
private sector employment jumped by much more than expected in the month
of February.

ADP said private sector employment surged by 475,000 jobs in February
compared to economist estimates for an increase of 388,000 jobs.

The report also showed a substantial revision to the January data, with
the revised data showing employment spiked by 509,000 jobs compared to
the previously reported loss of 301,000 jobs.

The stronger than expected job growth partly reflected a sharp increase
in employment in the service-providing sector, which added 417,000 jobs.

Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector helped lead the way
higher, surging up by 170,000 jobs during the month.

The report also showed employment at large businesses spiked by 552,000
jobs in February, more than offsetting the loss of 96,000 jobs at small
businesses.

"Last month large companies showed they are well-poised to compete with
higher wages and benefit offerings, and posted the strongest reading
since the early days of the pandemic recovery," said Nela Richardson,
ADP chief economist.

She added, "Small companies lost ground as they continue to struggle to
keep pace with the wages and benefits needed to attract a limited pool
of qualified workers."

On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its more closely
watched monthly employment jobs, which includes both public and private
sector jobs.

Economists currently expect employment to jump by 400,000 jobs in
February after surging by 467,000 jobs in January. The unemployment rate
is expected to edge down to 3.9 percent from 4.0 percent.
