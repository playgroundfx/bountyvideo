India's manufacturing activity increased in February, survey results
from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.9 in February
from 54.0 in January. A score above 50.0 indicates expansion.

New [business][1] inflows increased in February and demand from
international clients rose at the quickest pace in three months.

Production rose for the eighth month in a row. New orders and output
increased in February.

Backlogs of work rose marginally in February and employment declined,
with the overall rate of job shedding being only fractional.

Stocks of finished goods declined in February and delivery time
lengthened.

Business sentiment improved sharply in February and the degree of
optimism remained below the long-run average.

"For now, India's manufacturing sector has weathered the storm of the
Omicron variant, undoubtedly supported by the relatively high
inoculation rate," Shreeya Patel, economist at IHS Markit, said.
