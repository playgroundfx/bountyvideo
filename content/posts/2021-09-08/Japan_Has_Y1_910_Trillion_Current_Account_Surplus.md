Japan had a current account surplus of 1.910 trillion yen in July, the
Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday - up 24.5 percent on year.

That was shy of expectations for a surplus of 2.30 trillion following
the 905.1 billion yen surplus in June.

Exports were up 37.5 percent on year at 7.220 trillion yen, while
imports jumped an annual 29.3 percent to 6.598 trillion yen for a trade
surplus of 622.3 billion yen.

The capital account showed a deficit of 5.0 billion yen following the
36.7 billion yen shortfall a month earlier.
