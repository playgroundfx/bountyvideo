Consumer prices in China were up 2.7 percent on year in July, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 2.6 percent and was up
from the 2.5 percent gain in June.

On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.6 percent - again topping forecasts
for a rise of 0.4 percent following the 0.1 percent decline in the
previous month.

The bureau also said the producer prices were down 2.4 percent on year
versus expectations for a fall of 2.5 percent after skidding 3.0 percent
a month earlier.
