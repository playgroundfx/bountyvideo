positive, survey data from Sentix showed Monday.

Economists had forecast a score of -15.1.

The current situation index of the survey climbed to -41.3 from -49.5 in
the previous month. The latest reading was the highest since March.

in recession," Sentix said. "Nonetheless, the recovery is
progressing,.."

The expectations sub-index slightly eased to 19.3 from 19.5 in July.
"Expectations remain stably positive, meaning that the economic recovery
should continue," Sentix said.

corona infections does not leave a new fear reflex in the economic
indicators.

headline index rose to -4.5 from -10.5 and the highest since February.
