China's consumer price inflation accelerated in July on higher food
costs as regional flooding disrupted transportation, and the decline in
factory gate prices slowed further reflecting the recovery in economic
activity, official data showed Monday.

Inflation rose to 2.7 percent in July from 2.5 percent in June, the
National Bureau of Statistics reported. The rate was marginally above
economists' forecast of 2.6 percent.

Food prices advanced 13.2 percent annually as pork prices surged 85.7
percent amid supply disruptions. Food price inflation increased from
11.1 percent in June.

Meanwhile, non-food prices remained flat versus June's 0.3 percent rise.

Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, slowed to 0.5
percent from 0.9 percent in June.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices climbed 0.6 percent, offsetting a
0.1 percent drop in June. Economists had forecast a monthly increase of
0.4 percent.

Amid higher commodity prices, producer prices declined at a slower pace
of 2.4 percent annually in July, after posting a 3 percent decrease in
June, another report from NBS showed. Prices were expected to fall 2.5
percent.

Month-on-month, producer prices were down 2.4 percent in July.

Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said factory
gate deflation continued to ease in July, reflecting the ongoing
recovery in economic activity.
