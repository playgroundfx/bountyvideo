New Zealand [business][1] confidence weakened in August after the post-
lockdown rebound in July, preliminary data from ANZ showed Monday.

The business confidence index fell to -42.4 in August from -31.8 in
July.  
  
Most forward-looking activity indicators deteriorated from July. The own
activity outlook index slid to -17.0 from -8.9 a month ago.

A net 15 percent of firms expect to reduce investment and a net 32
percent expect lower profits. Both readings were below thier July
levels.  
  
Conversely, capacity utilization, which correlates pretty well with GDP,
improved five points to -3 percent. Compared to the same month a year
ago, 7 percent of businesses reported lower activity, which was a solid
improvement of 11 points versus July.

Near-term employment intentions deteriorated 6 points to a net 21
percent of firms expecting to cut jobs.

Deflationary pressures remained evident but with some mixed monthly
moves. Expected costs and pricing intentions eked out small gains, but
one-year-ahead inflation expectations fell slightly, the survey showed.
