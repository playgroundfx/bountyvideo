Slovakia industrial production declined at a softer pace in June as the
slump in the transport equipment manufacturing moderated significantly
after lockdown restrictions to battle the [coronavirus][1] pandemic were
eased, data from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic showed on
Monday.

Industrial production fell a working day adjusted 8.5 percent year-on-
year in June, following a 33.3 percent decrease in May. This was the
smallest decline since the beginning of this year.

Industrial production reached a 91.5 percent level of the last year, the
agency said.

In addition to the recovery in the transport equipment manufacturing,
production of chemicals and basic pharmaceutical products also
increased.

Production for manufacturing declined 10.6 percent yearly in June and
those of mining and quarrying fell 0.7 percent.

Meanwhile, production for electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning
sector output rose 7.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production grew 21.7 percent in June.
