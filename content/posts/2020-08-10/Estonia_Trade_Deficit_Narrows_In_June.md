Estonia's trade deficit narrowed in June as imports declined and exports
remained unchanged, figures from Statistics Estonia showed on Monday.

The trade deficit fell to EUR 11 million in June from EUR 108 million in
the same month last year. In April, the trade deficit was EUR 86
million.

Exports remained unchanged year-on-year in June, after a 25.0 percent
decline in May.

Imports decreased 8.0 percent annually in June, following a 24.0 percent
fall in the previous month.

"The main contributors to the recovery of exports were wood and metal
industries," leading analyst at Statistics Estonia, Evelin Puura, said.

"In the second quarter as a whole, the main impact on trade came from
decreased exports and imports of transport equipment and mineral
products."

In the second quarter, the trade deficit was EUR 162 million. Exports
and imports fell 18.0 percent and 15.0 percent, respectively.
