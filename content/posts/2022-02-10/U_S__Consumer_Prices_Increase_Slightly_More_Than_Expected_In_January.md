Reflecting higher prices for food, electricity, and shelter, the Labor
Department released a report on Thursday showing U.S. consumer prices
increased by slightly more than expected in the month of January.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index climbed by 0.6
percent in January, matching the upwardly revised advance seen in
December.

Economists had expected consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent, matching
the increase originally reported for the previous month.

With the slightly bigger than expected monthly increase, the annual rate
of growth in consumer prices accelerated to 7.5 percent in January, the
biggest spike since February of 1982.

The report showed core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy
prices, also advanced by 0.6 percent in January, matching the increase
seen in December. Economists had expected core prices to rise by 0.5
percent.

The annual rate of growth in core prices accelerated to 6.0 percent in
January from 5.5 percent in December, showing the biggest jump since
August of 1982.
