First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits showed another modest
decrease in the week ended February 5th, according to a report released
by the Labor Department on Thursday.

The report said initial jobless claims fell to 223,000, a decrease of
16,000 from the previous week's revised level of 239,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 230,000 from the
238,000 originally reported for the previous month.

The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average
also edged down to 253,250, a decrease of 2,000 from the previous week's
revised average of 255,250.
