Indonesia's central bank on Thursday held its key interest rate steady
again to control inflation and underpin the economic recovery.

The Board of Governors decided to maintain the seven-day reverse repo
rate at 3.50 percent, the Bank Indonesia said. The previous change in
the rate was a quarter-point reduction in February 2020.

"The decision is consistent with the need to maintain exchange rate
stability, control inflation and stimulate economic growth amid a build-
up of external pressure," the bank said in a statement.  
  
The bank reiterated a slew of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures that include plans to
raise the rupiah reserve requirement for various banks in a staggered
manner.

The central bank expects the [economy][1] to grow 4.7-5.5 percent this
year after a 3.69 percent expansion in 2021. Growth is expected to be
supported by a faster vaccination program, broader reopening of the
economy and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimuli by Bank Indonesia, the government.

Inflation is expected to remain low this year, within the 3.0±1 percent
target. Adequate supply in response to increasing demand, anchored
inflation expectations, rupiah exchange rate stability are expected to
help keep inflation within the target range.
