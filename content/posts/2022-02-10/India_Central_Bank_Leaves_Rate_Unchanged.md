India's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record
low and maintained its 'accommodative' stance as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers assessed
that the ongoing recovery needs continued [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India, led by
Governor Shaktikanta Das, unanimously decided to retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo
rate at 4.00 percent.

The reverse repo rate was left unchanged at 3.35 percent, defying
expectations for a hike to 3.55 percent.

The MPC decided by a majority of 5 to 1 to continue with the
accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth
on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on
the [economy][1], while ensuring that inflation remains within the
target going forward.

Taking into consideration the outlook for inflation and growth, the MPC
was of the view that continued [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support is warranted for a durable
and broad-based recovery.

The governor reiterated that RBI actions will be ca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted and well-
telegraphed.  
The bank said real GDP growth at 9.2 percent for 2021-22 took it
moderately above the level of GDP in 2019-20.

There is some loss of the momentum of near-term growth while global
factors are turning adverse. The central bank projected 7.8 percent
growth for the fiscal year 2022-23.

The bank said core inflation remains elevated and it expects headline
inflation to peak in the March quarter of fiscal year 2021-22.

The RBI retained the 5.3 percent inflation forecast for the fiscal year
2022. The CPI reading for January 2022 was expected to move closer to
the upper tolerance band, largely due to adverse base effects.

On the assumption of a normal monsoon, inflation is projected at 4.5
percent for the financial year 2023.
