The annual rate of U.S. consumer price growth accelerated more than
expected in the month of January, the Labor Department revealed in a
highly anticipated report on Thursday.

The report showed consumer prices in January were up by 7.5 percent
compared to the same month a year ago, reflecting the fastest annual
growth since February of 1982.

Economists had expected the annual rate of consumer price growth to
accelerate to 7.3 percent from 7.0 percent in December.

Dr. Christoph Balz and Bernd Weidensteiner, Senior Economists at
Commerzbank, said the inflation rate is unlikely to have peaked but they
expect only slightly higher rates in the coming months.

"This is because the year-on-year rate will only rise if prices increase
more strongly from month to month than in the same month in 2021," said
Balz and Weidensteiner. "This seems likely for February, where the
increase in 2021 was only 0.4%."

"However, in March and April (2021: +0.6% in each case) and May (2021:
+0.7%) the bar is so high that it will probably only be cleared in the
event of further exorbitant price increases for energy," they added.
"And this is only likely in the event of an escalation of the Ukraine
conflict."

The faster year-over-year growth came as the Labor Department said its
consumer price index climbed by 0.6 percent in January, matching the
upwardly revised advance seen in December.

Economists had expected consumer prices to rise by 0.5 percent, matching
the increase originally reported for the previous month.

The bigger than expected monthly increase in consumer prices reflected
higher prices for food, electricity, and shelter.

The report showed core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy
prices, also advanced by 0.6 percent in January, matching the increase
seen in December. Economists had also expected core prices to rise by
0.5 percent.

Along with higher prices for shelter, the increase in core pries
reflected higher prices for household furnishings and operations, used
cars and trucks, medical care and apparel.

The annual rate of growth in core prices accelerated to 6.0 percent in
January from 5.5 percent in December, showing the biggest jump since
August of 1982.

Next Tuesday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on producer price inflation in the month of January.

Producer prices are currently expected to rise by 0.4 percent in January
after edging up by 0.2 percent in December, while the annual rate of
growth is expected to inch up to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent.
