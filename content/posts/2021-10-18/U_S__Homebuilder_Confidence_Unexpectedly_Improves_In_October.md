A report released by the National Association of Home Builders on Monday
showed a notable improvement in U.S. homebuilder confidence in the month
of October.

The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index climbed to 80
in October from 76 in September. Economists had expected the index to
come in unchanged.

"Although demand and home sales remain strong, builders continue to
grapple with ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages that
are delaying completion times and putting upward pressure on building
material and home prices," said NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke.

The unexpected advance by the housing market index reflected increases
by all three of the component indices.

The index gauging current sales conditions jumped to 87 in October from
82 in September, the gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers
climbed to 65 from 61 and the component measuring sales expectations in
the next six months rose to 84 from 81.

"Builders are getting increasingly concerned about affordability hurdles
ahead for most buyers," said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz.
"Building material price increases and bottlenecks persist and interest
rates are expected to rise in coming months as the Fed begins to taper
its purchase of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt."

"Policymakers must focus on fixing the broken supply chain," he added.
"This will spur more construction and help ease upward pressure on home
prices."

On Tuesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on new residential construction in the month of September.

Housing starts are expected to rise to an annual rate of 1.620 million
in September from 1.615 million in August, while building permits are
expected to drop to a rate of 1.680 million from 1.728 million.
