The euro area private sector contracted sharply in November as member
countries reintroduced more restrictions to counter the spread of
Covid-19 infection, flash survey data from IHS Markit showed Monday.

The composite output index plunged to a six-month low of 45.1 from the
neutral 50.0 in October. The score was forecast to fall to 45.8.

The further downturn of the [economy][1] signaled for the fourth quarter
represents a major set-back to the region's health and extends the
recovery period, Chris Williamson, chief [business][2] economist at IHS
Markit said.

After a 7.4 percent contraction of GDP in 2020, IHS Markit expects only
a 3.7 percent expansion in 2021.

The drop in the composite index to well below 50 adds to the evidence
that the euro-zone economy will post another sizeable contraction in the
fourth quarter, Jack Allen-Reynolds, an economist at Capital Economics,
said.

But with vaccines looking increasingly likely to be rolled out in the
first half of next year, the surveys show greater optimism about 2021.

The deteriorating performance was broad-based, albeit with the service
sector hardest hit from virus containment measures.

The services Purchasing Managers' Index slid to 41.3 from 46.9 in the
previous month. The reading was seen at 42.5.

At the same time, the manufacturing PMI came in at 53.6, down moderately
from 54.8 in October. The expected score was 53.1.

Inflows of new orders advanced in manufacturing at the slowest rate
recorded over the past five months, while new business placed at service
providers collapsed to an extent not seen since May.

Employment fell across the Eurozone as a whole for a ninth consecutive
month in November.  
  
Further, companies resorted to discounting to boost sales in the service
sector, causing selling prices to fall at a faster pace. Meanwhile,
goods prices increased at the fastest pace since May 2019 due to higher
input costs.

Looking ahead, business expectations about the coming 12 months
recovered most of the slump seen in October to run at the second highest
since February.

Divergent trends were also seen across the region, with Germany again
bucking the wider downturn.

Germany's private sector growth moderated to a five-month low in
November due to the tightening of Covid-19 restrictions.

The composite output index dropped to 52.0 in November from 55.0 in
October. The reading was forecast to fall sharply to 50.4.

At 46.2, the services Purchasing Managers' Index reached a 6-month low.
The score was forecast to drop to 46.3 from 49.5 in October.

At the same time, the factory PMI came in at an elevated level of 57.9,
but down from 58.2 a month ago. The expected reading was 56.5.

Elsewhere, France's private sector contracted at the fastest pace in six
months in November predominantly driven by the weakness in services.

The composite output index fell to 39.9 from 47.5 in October.
Nonetheless, the reading was above economists' forecast of 34.0.

The flash services PMI dropped notably to 38.0 from 46.5 a month ago but
slightly above the forecast of 37.7.

At the same time, the manufacturing PMI came in at 49.1 in November
versus 51.3 in the previous month. The score was expected to drop
moderately to 50.1.
