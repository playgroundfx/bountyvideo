Singapore's consumer prices declined in October, data from the Monetary
Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed on
Monday.

The consumer price index fell 0.2 percent year-on-year in October, after
remaining unchanged in September. Economists had expected the price to
remain unchanged.

This latest consumer prices outcome was largely due to a sharper decline
in private transport costs.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.2 percent annually in October, following a 0.1 percent
decrease in the preceding month. Economists had forecast a 0.1 percent
fall.

The latest decline can be attributed to steeper declines in the costs of
services, retail and other goods, and lower food inflation.

The statistical office expects external inflation to remain low in the
coming quarters, amid weak demand conditions.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average between -5 percent and 0 percent this year, the statistical
office and MAS said.

Next year, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average 0-1 percent, while
the CPI-All Items inflation is projected to be between -0.5 and 0.5
percent.
