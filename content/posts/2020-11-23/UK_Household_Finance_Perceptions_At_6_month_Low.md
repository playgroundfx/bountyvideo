UK households' finance perceptions weakened to a six-month low in
November as savings and earnings declined sharply, survey data from IHS
Markit and Ipsos MORI showed on Monday.

The household finance index, which measures households' overall
perceptions of financial well-being, fell to 40.0 from 40.8 in October.

The decline signaled a more intense strain on the household finances
amid a second lockdown in England and ongoing restrictions across the
rest of the UK, IHS Markit said.

The outlook remained negative in November, with UK households on average
expecting their financial situation to worsen in 12 months' time, though
the level of pessimism was the weakest since March, the survey added.

Households' disposable income fell the most since May and at a sharp
rate as suggested by cash availability and credit demand. As households
dipped into savings to finance some purchases and compensate falling
incomes, the level of savings dropped sharply at the quickest rate in
seven years.

Further, the income from employment fell faster to its lowest level
since July amid [business][1] activity declining in workplaces at the
steepest rate in four months. The trend may have been partly driven by
renewed use of furlough due to business closures in the hospitality and
retail sectors, IHS Markit said.

That said, job perceptions recovered further from April's survey low and
households were the least pessimistic since March. But the index
measuring job security remained noticeably below the 50 mark.

The extension of the furlough scheme to March 2021 appears to have
helped to moderate the degree of job insecurity among UK households, IHS
Markit said.

The survey also found that around a quarter of surveyed households
foresee the next move by the Bank of England to be a rate cut at some
time, despite the record low base rate at present.

"The latest data paint a worrying picture for household finances across
the UK, with no sign yet of a recovery from the blow caused by the
pandemic," Lewis Cooper, economist at IHS Markit, said.

"The easing of lockdown measures will likely elevate some of the strain
we saw in November, but until the economic recovery becomes more
sustainable it is unlikely households will see much improvement in their
financial situation."
