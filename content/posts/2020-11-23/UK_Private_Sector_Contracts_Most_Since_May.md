The UK private sector contracted the most in six months in November due
to the fastest reduction in service sector output since May amid
temporary closures among leisure and hospitality companies, flash survey
results revealed Monday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply composite
output index dropped to 47.4 in November from 52.1 in October.

A score below 50 indicates contraction. However, the score was above
economists' forecast of 42.5.

The service sector contracted notably in November as the second lockdown
weighed heavily on leisure and hospitality sector. In contrast,
manufacturing production expanded at a robust pace in November and the
rate of growth accelerated since the previous month.

The services Purchasing Mangers' Index slid sharply to 45.8 from 51.4 in
the previous month. The score was seen at 52.3.

Meanwhile, the manufacturing PMI rose to 55.2 in November from 53.7 a
month ago. The expected reading was 53.3.

Demand from export [markets][1], especially from China and the EU
underpinned the manufacturing sector growth.

According to Markit, the underperformance of the service [economy][2]
relative to the manufacturing sector was the widest in almost 25 years
of data collection.

The deterioration in the overall private sector was less severe than
reported during the first round of restrictions back in the spring,
James Smith, an ING economist said.

For 2021, the outlook looks better, albeit still mixed. Initial supply
chain disruptions from Brexit remain a clear possibility, the economist
said. While this is unlikely to deliver a Covid-19 style hit to GDP, it
will drag on the recovery.

Meanwhile, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on vaccines offers a clear upside to 2021, but for
the economy, a lot will also hinge on how and when the unprecedented
furlough support is unwound, Smith added.

Total new work received by UK private sector firms decreased for the
second month. Job shedding accelerated across the private sector, with
the rate of decline in staffing numbers the steepest for three months.

Looking ahead, private sector companies remain optimistic that
[business][3] activity will increase during the next 12 months. The
degree of optimism was the strongest since March 2015.
