Overall nationwide consumer prices in Japan were up 0.6 percent on year
in November, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said on
Friday - beating forecasts for 0.4 percent and up from 0.1 percent in
October.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, climbed an annual 0.5
percent - also exceeding expectations for 0.4 percent and up from 0.1
percent in the previous month.

Individually, prices were higher for food, housing, fuel, furniture,
clothing and recreation; they were lower for medical care,
transportation and communication.

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, overall inflation and core CPI
both rose 0.3 percent.
