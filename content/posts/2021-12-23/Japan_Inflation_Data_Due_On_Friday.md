Japan will on Friday see November numbers for consumer prices and
housing starts, headlining a light day for Asia-Pacific economic
activity.

In October, overall inflation was down 0.3 percent on month and up 0.1
percent on year, while core CPI was also up an annual 0.1 percent.
Housing starts are tipped to rise 7.1 percent on year, slowing from 10.4
percent in the previous month.

Singapore will release November data for industrial production, with
forecasts suggesting a decline of 0.4 percent on month and an increase
of 13.4 percent on year. That follows the 2.4 percent monthly increase
and the 16.9 percent yearly gain in October.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Indonesia are closed on Friday in
observance of Christmas Eve; they will re-open on Tuesday.
