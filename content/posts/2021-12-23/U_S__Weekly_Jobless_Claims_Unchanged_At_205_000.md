First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits came in flat in the
week ended December 18th, according to a report released by the Labor
Department on Thursday.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims were unchanged from the
previous week's revised level of 205,000. Economists had expected
jobless claims to edge down to 205,000 from the 206,000 originally
reported for the previous week.

Meanwhile, the report showed the less volatile four-week moving average
edged up to 206,250, an increase of 2,750 from the previous week's
revised average of 203,500.
