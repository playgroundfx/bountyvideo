A report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed new
orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods spiked much more than
expected in the month of November.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders surged up by 2.5
percent in November following a revised 0.1 percent uptick in October.

Economists expected durable goods orders to jump by 1.6 percent compared
to the 0.4 percent drop that had been reported for the previous month.

The bigger than expected increase in durable goods orders was largely
due to a substantial rebound in orders for transportation equipment,
which shot up by 6.5 percent in November after dipping by 0.3 percent in
October and slumping by 2.8 percent in September.

Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts led the way higher, soaring by
34.1 in November after plunging by 4.1 percent in October and plummeting
by 31.2 percent in September.

Excluding the sharp increase in orders for transportation equipment,
durable goods orders climbed by 0.8 percent in November after rising by
0.3 percent in October. Ex-transportation orders were expected to
increase by 0.6 percent.

A 4.0 percent jump in orders for computers and electronic products led
the advance in ex-transportation orders, while orders for fabricated
metal products and primary metals saw modest increases.

Meanwhile, the report showed orders for non-defense capital goods
excluding aircraft, a key indicator of [business][1] spending, edged
down by 0.1 percent in November after climbing by 0.9 percent in
October.

Shipments in the same category, which is the source data for equipment
investment in GDP, rose by 0.3 percent in November following a 0.4
percent increase in October.

"Shipments are on track for a 7% annualized gain in the fourth quarter
in nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), but accounting for the surge in prices, were probably
little changed in real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)," said Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist
at Capital Economics.

"That in turn suggests that business equipment investment will be
similarly weak in the fourth quarter, after falling outright in the
third," he added. "That illustrates the extent to which price increases
and shortages are hitting investment demand as well as consumption."
