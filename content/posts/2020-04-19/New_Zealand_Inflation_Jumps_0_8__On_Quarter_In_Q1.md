Overall consumer prices in New Zealand were up a seasonally adjusted 0.8
percent on quarter in the first three months of 2020, Statistics New
Zealand said on Monday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.4 percent and was up
from 0.5 percent in the three months prior.

On a yearly basis, consumer prices jumped 2.5 percent - again coming in
above forecasts for 2.1 percent and up from 1.9 percent in the previous
three months.

The trimmed-mean measures - which exclude extreme price movements -
ranged from 2.6 percent to 2.7 percent for the year.
