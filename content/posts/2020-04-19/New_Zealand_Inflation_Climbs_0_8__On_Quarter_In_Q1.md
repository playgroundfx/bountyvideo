Overall consumer prices in New Zealand advanced a seasonally adjusted
0.8 percent on quarter in the first three months of 2020, Statistics New
Zealand said on Monday.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 0.4 percent and was up
from 0.5 percent in the three months prior.

Individually, alcoholic beverages and tobacco rose 5.0 percent on
quarter, influenced by higher prices for cigarettes and tobacco (up 11
percent). Food prices rose 2.0 percent, influenced by a rise in grocery
food prices (up 2.1 percent).

Housing and household utilities rose 0.9 percent, influenced by higher
prices for rentals for housing (up 1.2 percent). Transport fell 1.7
percent, influenced by lower prices for passenger transport services
(down 6.0 percent).

On a yearly basis, consumer prices jumped 2.5 percent - again coming in
above forecasts for 2.1 percent and up from 1.9 percent in the previous
three months.

Individually, housing and household utilities increased 3.3 percent,
with rentals for housing up 3.7 percent. Food prices increased 3.3
percent, with grocery food up 3.0 percent. Alcoholic beverages and
tobacco increased 5.1 percent, with cigarettes and tobacco up 11.2
percent.

Tradables rose 0.1 percent in the March 2020 quarter. Price rises in
grocery food and fruit and vegetables were partly offset by falls in
passenger transport services and private transport supplies and
services.

In the year to March 2020, tradables increased 1.5 percent, with higher
prices for private transport supplies and services; meat, poultry, and
fish; and grocery food.

Non-tradables rose 1.4 percent in the March 2020 quarter, mainly driven
by higher prices for cigarettes and tobacco, rents, and purchase of
housing. Lower prices for telecommunication services partly offset the
rise.

In the year to March 2020, non-tradables increased 3.4 percent. Higher
prices for rents, cigarettes and tobacco, and restaurant meals and
ready-to-eat food made the largest contributions.

The trimmed-mean measures - which exclude extreme price movements -
ranged from 2.6 percent to 2.7 percent for the year.
