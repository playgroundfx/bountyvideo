Hungary's industrial production grew at a softer pace as initially
estimated in February, final data from the Hungarian Central Statistical
Office showed on Wednesday.

Industrial production rose a working-day adjusted 1.7 percent year-on-
year in February, after a 2.8 percent increase in January. This was in
line with initial estimate.

On a non-adjusted basis, industrial production increased 4.1 percent
annually in February, following a 2.4 percent rise in the preceding
month, as initially estimated.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production rose 0.2 percent
in February, after a 4.6 percent increase in the prior month, as
estimated.
