New York manufacturing activity contracted at the fastest rate on record
in the month of April, according to a report released by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index
plummeted to a negative 78.2 in April from a negative 21.5 in March,
with a negative reading indicating a contraction in regional
manufacturing activity. The index was expected to slump to a negative
35.0.

With the much bigger than expected nosedive, the general business
conditions index plunged to its lowest level in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the
surveyâ€”by a wide margin.

The steep drop by the headline index reflected record declines by the
new orders and shipments indexes, which plunged to a negative 66.3 and a
negative 68.1, respectively.

The number of employees index also nosedived to a negative 55.3 in April
from a negative 1.5 in March, indicating a record contraction in
employment.

The report also said the prices paid index tumbled to 5.8 in April from
24.5 in March, while the prices received index slumped to a negative 8.4
from a positive 10.1.

Meanwhile, the New York Fed said firms expect conditions to be slightly
better six months from now, with the index for future business
conditions rising to 7.0 in April from 1.2 in March.

"The index measuring manufacturing firms' expectations rebounded
slightly in April, but still signals a weak outlook," said a note from
economists at Oxford Economics.

The economists added, "Severely depressed demand, supply disruptions and
extremely high uncertainty will keep manufacturing on an extremely weak
trajectory in the near term."
