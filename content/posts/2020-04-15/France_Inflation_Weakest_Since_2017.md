France inflation slowed to the lowest in more than two years in March
largely due to the sharp downturn in energy prices, but the pace of
overall inflation was slightly higher than the initial estimate, final
data from the statistical office Insee showed Wednesday.

Consumer prices advanced at a slower pace of 0.7 percent year-on-year in
March after rising 1.4 percent in February. This was slightly above the
flash estimate of 0.6 percent.

A similar lower rate was last seen in July 2017.

Data showed that energy prices plunged 4 percent. Meanwhile, food prices
gained 1.9 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent after remaining
unchanged in February. The initial estimate showed a nil growth in
March.

At the same time, EU harmonized inflation halved to 0.8 percent from 1.6
percent a month ago. This was the lowest since July 2017. The initial
estimate showed an annual rate of 0.7 percent for March.

On a monthly basis, the harmonized index of consumer prices climbed 0.1
percent after staying flat in February. According to preliminary
estimate, prices had remained unchanged in March.

Core inflation fell sharply to 0.7 percent from 1.3 percent in the
previous month.
