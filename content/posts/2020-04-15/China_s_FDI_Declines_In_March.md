Foreign direct investment into China declined notably in March as
measures to contain the spread of [coronavirus][1] hindered trade and
investment.

FDI declined 14.1 percent in March from the last year, which was 11.5
percentage points less than February's fall, the Ministry of Commerce
reported Wednesday.

In the first quarter, the [economy][2] attracted $ 31.2 billion
investment. Investment declined more than 10 percent in the first three
months of 2020.

The National Bureau of Statistics is set to publish quarterly national
accounts and major economic indicators on April 17.

The International Monetary Fund forecast China's growth to ease to 1.2
percent this year, but to rebound with a growth surge of 9.2 percent
next year.
