With the [coronavirus][1] pandemic leading many factories to suspend
operations late in the month, the Federal Reserve released a report on
Wednesday showing the biggest monthly drop in U.S. industrial production
in over seventy years in the month of March.

The report said industrial production plunged by 5.4 percent in March
after rising by a downwardly revised 0.5 percent in February.

Economists had expected production to tumble by 4.0 percent compared to
the 0.6 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The Fed said the bigger than expected nosedive in industrial production
reflected the biggest monthly decrease since January of 1946.

Manufacturing output led the way lower, plummeting by 6.3 percent in
March after edging down by 0.1 percent in February. Most major
industries posted decreases, with the largest decline registered by
motor vehicles and parts.

The report said utilities output also tumbled by 3.9 percent in March
after spiking by 7.0 percent in February, while mining output slumped by
2.0 percent after sliding by 1.3 percent.

Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said the
steep drop in production "highlights that while coronavirus containment
measures are primarily slamming the brakes on service sector activity,
the manufacturing sector is also set for a significant downturn."

Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased to 72.7 percent
in March from 77.0 percent in February, falling to a rate that is 7.1
percentage points below its long-run average.

The Fed said capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector fell to
70.3 percent in March from 75.0 percent in February, while capacity
utilization in the mining and utilities sectors dropped to 86.3 percent
and 72.7 percent, respectively.
