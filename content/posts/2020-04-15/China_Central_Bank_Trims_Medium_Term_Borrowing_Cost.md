China's central bank reduced its medium-term borrowing cost on
Wednesday, in an attempt to mitigate the downturn caused by the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic.

The People's Bank of China on Wednesday said it trimmed the one-year
medium-term lending facility, or MLF, rate to 2.95 percent from 3.15
percent. The bank injected CNY 100 billion through the MLF operation.

In March, the PBoC had reduced the reserve requirement ratio for
qualified banks and the reverse repo rate.

The latest central bank decision came ahead of the release of GDP data.
The National Bureau of Statistics is set to publish quarterly national
accounts and major economic indicators on April 17.

The International Monetary Fund said China, where the Covid-19 pandemic
started, is forecast to grow a modest 1.2 percent this year, but rebound
with a growth surge of 9.2 percent next year.

According to World Economic Outlook, global GDP is set to contract 3
percent this year, thanks to the lockdowns imposed by countries across
the world.

The PBoC has taken yet another step to help banks and borrowers weather
the ongoing economic weakness and is preparing to lower interest rates
further in the coming months, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.
