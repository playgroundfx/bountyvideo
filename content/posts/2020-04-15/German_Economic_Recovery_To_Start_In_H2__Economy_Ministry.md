Germany's economic recovery would start in the second half of the year
underpinned by the measures taken by the government to mitigate the
downturn caused by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic, the [economy][2]
ministry said in a report released on Wednesday.

The economy has been in recession since March and it is expected to
continue until the middle of the year, the ministry assessed.

The collapsing global demand, the interruption of supply chains, changes
in consumer behavior and uncertainty among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are having a
massive impact on Germany, the ministry reported.

Due to the corona pandemic, a unprecedented decline in the industrial
economy is expected in months ahead.

According to the spring report prepared by five leading research
institutes, gross domestic product will fall 1.9 percent in the first
quarter of 2020 and 9.8 percent in the second quarter due to the
lockdown.

The ministry observed that the leading labor market indicators slackened
massively, suggesting that employment will decline and unemployment will
rise as a result of pandemic.
