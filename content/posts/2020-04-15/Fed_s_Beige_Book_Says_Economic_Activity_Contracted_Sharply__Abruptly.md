U.S. economic activity contracted sharply and abruptly across all
regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve's
Beige Book said on Wednesday.

The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic
conditions in the twelve Fed districts, noted the hardest hit industries
included leisure and hospitality and retail due to social distancing
measures and mandated closures.

With the pandemic affecting firms in many sectors, the Fed noted
employment declined in all districts, steeply in many cases.

The jobs cuts were most severe in the retail and leisure and hospitality
sectors, although many districts said sharp job cuts were widespread.

Looking ahead, the central bank said the near-term outlook was for even
more job cuts in the coming months.

The Beige Book also said the general direction of price inflation was
down for both selling prices and non-labor input prices, as districts
reported either slowing price growth, flat prices, or modest to moderate
declines in prices on balance.

The economic outlook was described as highly uncertain among

to worsen in the next several months.
