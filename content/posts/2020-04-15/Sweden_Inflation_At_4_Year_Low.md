Sweden's consumer price inflation eased to the lowest in four years in
March, data from Statistics Sweden showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index rose 0.6 percent year-on-year in March, after a
1.0 percent increase in February. This was in line with economists'
expectation.

The latest inflation was the lowest since February 2016, when it was 0.4
percent.

On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in March,
after a 0.5 percent rise in the preceding month. Economists had expected
a 0.3 percent fall.

The CPI with fixed interest rate, or CPIF rose 0.6 percent annually in
March, slower than 1.0 percent increase in the prior month. Economists
had expected a 0.7 percent rise.

On a monthly basis, the CPIF decreased 0.2 percent in February, after a
0.5 percent rise in the previous month. Economists had forecast a 0.3
percent decline.
