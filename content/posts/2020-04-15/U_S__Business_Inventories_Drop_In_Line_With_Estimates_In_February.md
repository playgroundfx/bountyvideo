Business inventories in the U.S. decreased in line with economist
estimates in the month of February, the Commerce Department revealed in
a report released on Wednesday.

The report said [business][1] inventories fell by 0.4 percent in
February following a revised 0.3 percent decrease in January.

Economists had expected inventories to drop by 0.4 percent compared to
the 0.1 percent dip originally reported for the previous month.

The decrease in business inventories came as wholesale inventories slid
by 0.7 percent, while manufacturing and retail inventories fell by 0.4
percent and 0.3 percent, respectively.

The Commerce Department said business sales also slumped by 0.5 percent
in February after climbing by 0.5 percent in January.

Wholesale sales tumbled by 0.8 percent, retail sales fell by 0.5 percent
and manufacturing sales dipped by 0.2 percent.

With inventories and sales both falling, the total business
inventories/sales ratio in February was unchanged from the previous
month at 1.37.
