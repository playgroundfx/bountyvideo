Reflecting the impact of the [coronavirus][1]-induced shutdown, the
Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing a sharp
decline in U.S. retail sales in the month of March.

The Commerce Department said retail sales plummeted by 8.7 percent in
March after falling by a revised 0.4 percent in February.

Economists had expected retail sales to plunge by 8.0 percent compared
to the 0.5 percent drop originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding a nosedive in sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail
sales still tumbled by 4.5 percent in March following a 0.4 percent
decrease in February. Ex-auto sales were expected to slump by 4.8
percent.
