New York manufacturing activity contracted at the fastest rate on record
in the month of April, according to a report released by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index
plummeted to a negative 78.2 in April from a negative 21.5 in March,
with a negative reading indicating a contraction in regional
manufacturing activity. The index was expected to slump to a negative
35.0.

With the much bigger than expected nosedive, the general business
conditions index plunged to its lowest level in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the
surveyâ€”by a wide margin.
