Reflecting the impact of the [coronavirus][1]-induced shutdown, the
Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing a record
decline in U.S. retail sales in the month of March.

The Commerce Department said retail sales plummeted by 8.7 percent in
March after falling by a revised 0.4 percent in February.

Economists had expected retail sales to plunge by 8.0 percent compared
to the 0.5 percent drop originally reported for the previous month.

"With widespread lockdowns only beginning around the middle of the
March, and the panic buying phase of the crisis over, retail spending
looks like it will fall by at least as much again in April," said
Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

The nosedive in retail sales was partly due to a steep drop in sales by
motor vehicle and parts dealers, which sank by 25.6 percent in March
after sliding by 0.5 percent in February.

Excluding the sharp decline in auto sales, however, retail sales still
tumbled by 4.5 percent in March following a 0.4 percent decrease in
February. Ex-auto sales were expected to slump by 4.8 percent.

The report showed substantial decreases in most retail segments, with
sales by clothing and accessories stores showing a particularly steep
50.5 percent drop.

Sales by furniture and home furnishings stores, food service and
drinking places, and sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book
stores also fell by more than 20 percent.

On the other hand, the Commerce Department said sales by grocery stores
spiked by 26.9 percent as people stocked up on food and other necessary
items.

Sales by [health][2] and personal care stores and non-store retailers
also jumped by 4.3 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.

Core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline, building
materials and food services, also surged up by 1.7 percent in March
after falling by 0.5 percent in February.

"While the 1.7% advance in core retail sales highlights the effects of
precautionary purchases of essentials ahead of lockdowns, the narrower
gauge doesn't reflect the full extent of the coronavirus hit to consumer
outlays in coming months," said a note from economists at Oxford
Economics.
