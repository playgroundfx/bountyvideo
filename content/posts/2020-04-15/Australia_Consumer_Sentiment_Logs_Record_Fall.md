Australia's consumer confidence declined the most on record in April
after the [coronavirus][1] outbreak evolved from serious concern to
full-blown pandemic, survey data from Westpac showed on Wednesday.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment plunged 17.7
percent to 75.6 in April from 91.9 in March.

This was the biggest monthly decrease in forty seven year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the
survey, taking the indicator beyond the global financial crisis lows.

The survey reflects the large shocks to jobs and spending. Moreover,
there was a collapse in confidence in the housing market.

All five component sub-indexes fell in April. The biggest falls were in
the near term outlook for the [economy][2] and in attitudes towards
spending - reflecting the immediate effects of the shut-down, Westpac
noted.

The indicator measuring past family finances decreased 14.8 percent to
an eight-year low of 70.4 and the outlook for family finances slid 6.6
percent to 90.9.

The 'economy, next 12 months' sub-index logged a record fall of 31
percent to 53.7 in April. At the same time, the index measuring the
outlook for long-term, say five years, dropped moderately by 3.8 percent
to 87.0 in April.

Further, the 'time to buy a major household item' plunged 31.6 percent
to 76.2 in April. This was the lowest reading since the record low of 71
set in October 2008.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Unemployment Expectations Index jumped
8.2 percent in April following the sharp 8.5 percent increase in March.
At 158.1, the index was at a five year high.
