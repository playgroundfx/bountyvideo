Following the substantial rebound in new orders for U.S. manufactured
durable goods reported for the previous month, the Commerce Department
released a report on Monday showing durable goods orders continued to
move sharply higher in the month of June.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders surged up by 7.3
percent in June after skyrocketing by a downwardly revised 15.1 percent
in May.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to soar by 7.2 percent
compared to the 15.7 percent spike that had been reported for the
previous month.

Excluding another substantial increase in orders for transportation
equipment, durable goods orders still jumped by 3.3 percent in June
after shooting up by 3.6 percent in May. Ex-transportation orders were
expected to surge up by 3.5 percent.
