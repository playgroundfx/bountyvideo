Germany's [economy][1] shrank at a record pace in the second quarter,
but recent indicators suggest activity increased significantly in recent
weeks and the recovery is likely to continue in the second half of the
year supported by the fiscal stimulus, Bundesbank said in its monthly
report on Monday.

"The Bundesbank assumes that the economic recovery will continue in the
second half of the year," the report said.

"The recent economic stimulus package should also contribute to this."

Despite some rebound, the manufacturing situation remained bleak in
June, especially in automobile industry where production almost stopped
in May.

The retail industry was able to recover somewhat in May after relaxation
of coronaviurs, or Covid-19, containment measures.

The slump in exports in April and May was very widespread. However,
exports to China only shrank slightly as the economy began opening up
earlier than others.

Employment dropped significantly and unemployment grew markedly during
the second quarter. The number of people employed in short-time work
grew at a record pace.

Bundesbank expects negative inflation rates from July due to the
temporary lowering of VAT rates in the second half of 2020.

"With the withdrawal of the VAT reduction in January 2021, the rates
should turn out to be visibly positive again," the bank said.
