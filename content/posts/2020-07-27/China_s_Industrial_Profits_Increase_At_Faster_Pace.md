China's industrial profits increased at a faster pace of June as easing

Profits of steel 35.3 percent and that of non-ferrous metals grew 24.1
percent in June.

industrial profits is uncertain, the statistical office.

In the first half of 2020, industrial profits declined 12.8 percent from
the same period last year.

Some recovery from Covid-19 in parts of the rest of the world will also
have helped China's manufacturing output and profitability in June, the
economist said.
