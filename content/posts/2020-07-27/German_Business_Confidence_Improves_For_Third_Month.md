Germany's [business][1] confidence continued to improve in July as
companies were more satisfied with their current situation and
'carefully' optimistic about the months ahead, survey results from the
ifo Institute showed Monday.

The business confidence index rose more-than-expected to 90.5 from
revised 86.3 in June. The reading was forecast to rise to 89.3. This was
the third consecutive increase.

Both assessment of current situation and expectations of companies
strengthened in July. The index measuring current situation came in at
84.5 in July versus 81.3 a month ago. But the score was slightly below
expectations of 85.0.

At the same time, the expectations measure advanced to 97.0 from revised
91.6 a month ago. This was well above economists' forecast of 93.7.

The German [economy][2] is recovering step by step, ifo Institute
President Clemens Fuest said.

Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said the ifo reading provided more
evidence of a two-sided rebound. The V-shaped recovery continues but the
bounce back is losing steam, the economist added.

The return to pre-crisis levels will take time, patience and lots of
stimulus, he added.

In manufacturing, the business climate once again improved considerably.
Companies' assessment of their current situation was no longer quite as
poor as in previous months. Companies also expect business to grow again
in the coming months.

In the service sector, business sentiment rose strongly in July. Service
providers were more satisfied with their current situation. Likewise,
their expectations for the coming months logged a significant
improvement.

The upswing continued in trade, especially in retail. Companies adjusted
their assessments of the current situation and their expectations for
the coming months markedly upward.

In construction, the business climate continued to improve in July.
Construction companies were more satisfied with their current situation
and their expectations were less pessimistic.
