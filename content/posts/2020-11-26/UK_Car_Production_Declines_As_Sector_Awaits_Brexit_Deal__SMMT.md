UK car production logged a double-digit decline in October amid the auto
sector eagerly awaits Brexit agreement, the Society of Motor
Manufacturers & Traders said Thursday.

Car production plunged 18.2 percent on year in October. Only 110,179
units left factory gates in October, data showed.

Due to the impact of [coronavirus][1] and fresh lockdowns at home and
abroad, production for domestic market decreased 13.6 percent from the
last year and that for foreign market fell 19.1 percent.

During January to October period, output lagged by -33.8 percent with
379,308 fewer cars made than same period in 2019.

Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said, "These figures are yet more bad
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for an industry battered by Covid, Brexit and, now, the
unprecedented challenge of a complete shift to electrified vehicles in
under a decade."

The agency said in the event of 'no deal' Brexit, production losses
could cost as much as GBP 55.4 billion over the next five years, and
even with a so-called 'bare-bones' trade deal agreed, the cost to
industry would be some GBP 14.1 billion.
