The Bank of Korea retained its interest rate at a record low and lifted
its growth outlook as exports are set to improve gradually with global
recovery, and investment maintains its growth.

The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea, on Thursday, decided to
hold its key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at 0.50 percent, as widely expected.

"As the recovery in the Korean [economy][1] is expected to be modest and
inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak,
the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance," the
bank said in a statement.

The bank projected the economy to contract 1.1 percent this year instead
of 1.3 percent decline estimated previously. The outlook for next year
was revised up to 3 percent from 2.8 percent.

Gross domestic product is expected to grow 2.5 percent in 2022. The bank
cautioned that the uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook remain
elevated.

The bank observed that private consumption is likely to recover only
slowly due to delayed improvement of household income and [health][2]
concerns amid Covid-19 pandemic.

Facilities investment is forecast to rebound this year thanks to the IT
sector, the bank added. The non-IT sector is also projected to expand
investment.

Further, exports of goods are expected to shift to an increase as the
global economy improves gradually.

The net contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth is forecast to
rebound in the next year after a sharp contraction this year.

Consumer price inflation is forecast to rise to 1.0 percent and 1.5
percent in the next two years from 0.5 percent this year. Consumer price
inflation is expected to rise gradually as oil prices rise at a moderate
pace and economic conditions improve.
