European Central Bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers saw the risks to the euro area growth
outlook as clearly tilted to the downside and agreed that this warranted
an adjustment in its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) measures in December, the minutes
of the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session showed on Thursday.

"Overall, members considered the risks surrounding the growth outlook to
be clearly tilted to the downside," the minutes, which the ECB calls the
'account', of the October 28-29 Governing Council session revealed.

In the post-decision press conference on October 29, ECB President
Christine Lagarde had clearly signaled that the ECB is set to take
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action in December as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers will be presented with the
latest set of ECB staff macroeconomic projections.

Policymakers' comments thereafter have hinted at a possible expansion of
the pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP, and more targeted
lending to banks in the form of TLTROs.

Rate-setters felt that the sharper slowdown in growth momentum and the
weakening of underlying inflation dynamics, as well as the deterioration
in the balance of risks, would warrant a reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)tion of the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) instruments in December, the minutes said.

"It was noted that taking monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions in December would be
consistent with prevailing market expectations," the minutes added.

That said, they also stressed on the need to reaffirm that the Governing
Council stands ready to act at any time, when needed.

The resurgence in the [coronavirus][1] or Covid-19 pandemic has seen
countries like Germany and France return to lockdown. While the market
reaction to this has been relatively muted, they remain fragile and the
threat of a price correction persists in case of a no-deal Brexit or a
further worsening of the pandemic.

A delay in the disbursement of funds under the Next Generation- EU
programme could also affect market sentiment, the ECB minutes said.

Policymakers also pointed out that more than half of the PEPP envelope
was still available to conduct ongoing purchases in a flexible manner in
case of renewed market turbulence.

ECB rate-setters also expressed concern regarding the side-effects and
"diminishing returns" of existing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) instruments in an environment
of high uncertainty and very favorable financial conditions.
