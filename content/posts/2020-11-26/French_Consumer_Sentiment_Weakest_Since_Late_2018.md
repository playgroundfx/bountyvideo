French consumer confidence weakened to the lowest in nearly two years in
November, survey results from the statistical office Insee showed on
Thursday.

The consumer confidence index fell more-than-expected to 90 in November
from 94 in October. This was the lowest since December 2018, when the
score was 88. The expected score was 92.0.

Households were less optimistic concerning their future financial
situation. The corresponding balance lost five points to -14.
Conversely, their opinion about past financial situation was stable at
-15.

The survey showed that the share of households considering it is a
suitable time to make major purchases decreased markedly, with the
corresponding indicator declining eight points to -27, which was the
lowest level since last May.

Assessment about current saving capacity weakened in November, as the
index dropped three points to 22. Meanwhile, the indicator measuring
consumers view about their future saving capacity remained unchanged at
6.

The share of households considering it is a suitable time to save has
increased further. The index gained three points to 35.

Households' view about the future standard of living in France declined
again in November, with the index easing nine points -65. At the same
time, the index for past standard of living dropped moderately by three
points to -69.

As unemployment fear increased among households, the indicator for
unemployment in coming twelve months rose to 78, the highest since 2013,
from 74 in October.  
  
Households considering that prices will be on the rise during the next
twelve months have been much more numerous than the previous month, the
survey showed. The corresponding balance gained eight points -23.
