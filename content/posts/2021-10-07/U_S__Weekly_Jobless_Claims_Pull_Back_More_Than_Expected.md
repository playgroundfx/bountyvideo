With the more closely watched monthly jobs report on tap for Friday, the
Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing a bigger than
expected pullback in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in
the week ended October 2nd.

The report said initial jobless claims fell to 326,000, a decrease of
38,000 from the previous week's revised level of 364,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 348,000 from the
362,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The bigger than expected decrease came after jobless claims rose for
three straight weeks, reaching their highest level since early August.
