UK house prices grew at the strongest pace since 2007 as stamp duty
holiday draws to a close, survey data released by the Lloyds Bank
subsidiary Halifax showed on Thursday.

House prices grew 1.7 percent month-on-month in September, following an
increase of 0.8 percent in August. This was the third consecutive rise
in prices.

In three months to September, house prices grew 1.5 percent from the
previous three months.

The annual rate of house price growth increased to 7.4 percent from 7.2
percent in August.

"Against a backdrop of rising pressures on the cost of living and
impending increases in taxes, demand might be expected to soften in the
months ahead, with some industry measures already indicating lower
levels of buyer activity," Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax,
said.

Nevertheless, low borrowing costs and improving labor market prospects
for those already in employment are likely to continue to provide
support, Galley added.
