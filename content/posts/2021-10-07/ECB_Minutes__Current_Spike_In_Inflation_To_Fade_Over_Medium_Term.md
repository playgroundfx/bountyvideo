The near-term increase in Eurozone inflation was largely driven by
temporary factors that would fade in the medium term and not call for
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers of the European Central Bank said at the
September governing council meeting held in Frankfurt.

According to the account of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, released
Thursday, members agreed that accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance
remained necessary to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on
inflation and to re-anchor of inflation expectations solidly around the
new target.

Further, members said that risks to the economic outlook remained
broadly balanced.

The council noted that the economic outlook could deteriorate if the
pandemic worsened, which could delay the further reopening of the
[economy][1], or if supply shortages turned out to be more persistent
than currently expected.

At the September meeting, the bank had slowed the pace of its emergency
asset purchases programme and left its key rates unchanged.
