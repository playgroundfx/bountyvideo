Dutch consumer price inflation increased to the highest level in nearly
two years in September, data from the Central Bureau of Statistics
showed on Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 2.7 percent year-on-year in September,
following a 2.4 percent increase in August.

The latest inflation was the highest since December 2019, when it was
2.7 percent.

The latest inflation was mainly due to higher prices for gas and
electricity, among other things, the agency said.

Prices for energy rose 19.4 percent in September, after a 13.7 percent
fall in August.

Inflation based on the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, or HICP,
rose to 3.0 percent in September from 2.7 percent in the previous month.
