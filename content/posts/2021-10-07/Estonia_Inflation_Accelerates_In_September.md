Estonia's consumer prices rise in September, data from Statistics
Estonia showed on Thursday.

The consumer price index rose 6.6 percent year-on-year in September,
following a 5.0 percent growth in August.

"Compared to September 2020, the consumer price index was affected the
most by a 74.5 percent increase in the price of electricity that reached
homes, contributing a third of the index change," Viktoria Trasanov,
leading analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.

Prices for petrol increased 19.0 percent and diesel prices rose 28.5
percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 1.2 percent in September,
following a 0.7 percent rise in the previous month.
