The total value of retail sales in Japan was down a seasonally adjusted
4.5 percent on month in April, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry said on Monday - coming in at 12.200 trillion yen.

That missed expectations for a gain of 2.0 percent following the 1.2
percent increase in March.

On a yearly basis, retail sales climbed 12.0 percent - again missing
expectations for 15.3 percent after rising 5.2 percent in the previous
month.

Wholesale sales were down 0.9 percent on month and up 11.7 percent on
year at 33.289 trillion yen, while commercial sales sank 2.1 percent on
month and gained 11.8 percent on year at 45.489 trillion yen.
