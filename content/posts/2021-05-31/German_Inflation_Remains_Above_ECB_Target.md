Germany's harmonized inflation exceeded the European Central Bank's
target of 'below, but close to 2 percent' in May, flash data from
Destatis showed on Monday.

Harmonized consumer prices grew 2.4 percent year-on-year in May, faster
than the 2.1 percent increase in April. The rate came in line with
economists' expectations and was the highest since 2018.

At the same time, consumer price inflation accelerated to 2.5 percent
from 2 percent in April. The rate was above forecast of 2.3 percent.

With headline inflation on the rise, the ECB's attempt to avoid the
taper conversation will become more and more complicated, Carsten
Brzeski, an ING economist said. However, German headline inflation could
eventually range between 3 percent and 4 percent in the second half of
this year.

As temporary effects are largely responsible for higher inflation,
noticeably lower inflation rates can be expected again for the coming
year, Marco Wagner, an economist at Commerzbank, said. In sum, the
inflation rate should average 2.5 percent in 2021, but then fall to 2
percent next year.

On a monthly basis, the harmonized index of consumer prices gained 0.3
percent as expected in May. The consumer price index was up 0.5 percent,
bigger than the expected rate of 0.3 percent.
