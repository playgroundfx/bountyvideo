India's [economy][1] shrank 7.3 percent in the fiscal year ended March
31, preliminary estimates from the statistics ministry showed Monday.

The government had earlier forecast 8.0 percent decline in gross
domestic product for the year during which economic activity was
severely hurt by the [coronavirus][2] pandemic. In the fiscal year
2019-20, the economy grew 4.0 percent.

In the January to March quarter, the economy grew 1.6 percent year-on-
year, which was faster than the 1.0 percent expansion that economists
had forecast.

The December quarter growth was revised to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent.

Earlier, government data showed that the country's fiscal deficit for
the financial year 2020-21 was 9.3 percent of GDP, which was less than
the 9.5 percent estimated earlier.
