Industrial production in Japan rose 2.5 percent on month in April, the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on Monday.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 4.1 percent following
the downwardly revised 1.7 percent gain in March (originally 2.2
percent).

On a yearly basis, industrial production jumped 15.4 percent, beating
forecasts for 13.0 percent following the 3.4 percent increase in the
previous month.

Upon the release of the data, the METI maintained its assessment of
industrial production, saying that it is picking up.
