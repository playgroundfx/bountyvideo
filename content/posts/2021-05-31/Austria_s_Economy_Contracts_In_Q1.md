Austria's [economy][1] contracted again in the first quarter due to the
restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic, preliminary
data from Statistics Austria showed on Monday.

Gross domestic product fell 1.1 percent sequentially in the first
quarter, following a 2.7 percent drop in the fourth quarter.

However, data released earlier by the Austrian Institute for Economic
Research, or WIFO, suggested that the economy grew 0.2 percent in the
first quarter from the previous three months. The agency said the growth
in construction and industry offset the slump in the services sector.

On a yearly basis, GDP decreased 5.5 percent after falling about 5.6
percent in the preceding period.

According to WIFO, GDP had contracted 2.7 percent in the first quarter.

As a result of the third lockdown, the retail, transport, gastronomy and
accommodation sectors posted significant decreases, the statistical
office said. In contrast, positive impulses came from industry and
construction, which grew 1.8 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, from
the last year.
