Latvia's [economy][1] contracted at a slower pace in the first quarter
than estimated earlier, latest figures from the Central Statistical
Bureau showed Monday.  
  
Gross domestic product fell an unadjusted 1.3 percent year-on-year,
which was revised from a 2.2 percent fall. The decline came after a 1.5
percent drop in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
  
Output has been decreasing since the first quarter of 2020, as the
[coronavirus][2] pandemic hurt activity and pushed the economy into a
severe recession.

Household consumption decreased 7.4 percent annually, while public
spending grew 2.9 percent. Investment in gross fixed capital fell 4.5
percent. Exports of goods and services dropped 1.0 percent. Imports were
unchanged.  
  
On a seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted basis, GDP fell 1.2 percent
annually in the first quarter after a 1.8 percent drop in the previous
three months.

Seasonally and [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) adjusted GDP decreased 1.7 percent sequentially
following a 1.1 percent growth in the fourth quarter.
