Preliminary data released by the University of Michigan on Friday showed
a bigger than expected rebound in U.S. consumer sentiment in the month
of June.

The report said the consumer sentiment index climbed to 86.4 in June
after falling to 82.9 in May. Economists had expected the index to rise
to 84.0.

"The early June gain was mainly among middle and upper income households
and for future economic prospects rather than current conditions," said
Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin.

He added, "Stronger growth in the national [economy][1] was anticipated,
with an all-time record number of consumers anticipating a net decline
in unemployment."

The index of consumer expectations jumped to 83.8 in June from 78.8 in
May, while the current economic conditions index inched up to 90.6 from
89.4.

On the inflation front, the report said one-year inflation expectations
slid to 4.0 percent in June after spiking to 4.6 percent in May. Five-
year inflation expectations also fell to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent.

Despite the pullback in the expected rate of inflation, Curtin noted
rising inflation remained a top concern of consumers.

"Spontaneous references to market prices for homes, vehicles, and
household durables fell to their worst level since the all-time record
in November 1974," Curtin said. "These unfavorable perceptions of market
prices reduced overall buying attitudes for vehicles and homes to their
lowest point since 1982."

He added, "Fortunately, in the emergence from the pandemic, consumers
are temporarily less sensitive to prices due to pent-up demand and
record savings as well as improved job and income prospects."
