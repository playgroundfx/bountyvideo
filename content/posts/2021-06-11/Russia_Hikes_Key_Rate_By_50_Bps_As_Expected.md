Russia's central bank raised its key interest rate citing faster
economic recovery and rising inflation.

The Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate to 5.50 percent
from 5.00 percent, the Bank of Russia said in a statement on Friday.

This was the third consecutive hike in rates. The bank had earlier
lifted the benchmark rate by 50 basis points in April and 25 basis
points in March.

The bank suggested that increased inflationary pressure together with
recovery from the pandemic could lead to a more significant and
prolonged upward deviation in inflation from the target. This creates
the need for a further rate hike at the next meetings, the bank said.

With inflation set to remain stuck firmly above target for a while,
another 50-75 basis points of interest rate hikes in the second half of
this year look increasingly likely, Liam Peach, an economist at Capital
Economics, said.

Inflation is forecast to return to the Bank of Russia's target in the
second half of 2022 and to remain close to 4 percent thereafter.

Further, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers noted that economic activity is recovering faster
than the central bank expected. The [economy][1] is expected to return
to the pre-crisis level in the second quarter of 2021.
