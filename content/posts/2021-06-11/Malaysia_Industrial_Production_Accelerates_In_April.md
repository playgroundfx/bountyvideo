Malaysia's industrial production accelerated in April, data from the
Department of Statistics showed on Friday.

Industrial production rose 50.1 percent year-on-year in April, following
a 9.3 percent increase in March. Economists had expected a 7.8 percent
rise.

The growth in production was mainly driven by a rise in production of
manufacturing industry, mining and quarrying, and electricity.

Manufacturing output surged 68.0 percent yearly in April, following a
12.7 percent increase in the previous month.

Among other sectors, the mining and quarrying output gained 14.3 percent
and electricity output grew 22.9 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production fell 4.5 percent in April.
