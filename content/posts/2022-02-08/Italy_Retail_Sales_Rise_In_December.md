Italy's retail sales grew at the strongest pace in three months in
December, after a fall in the previous month, preliminary data from the
statistical office ISTAT showed Tuesday.  
  
In value [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales grew 0.9 percent from November, when they
fell 0.4 percent. Food sales rose 1.7 percent and non-food sales edged
up 0.1 percent.  
  
Among non-food products, sales grew in all sectors except electric
household appliances and audio-video equipment segment. Furniture,
textiles and household furnishings, clothing, and pharmaceutical
products registered the biggest sales growth figures in December.

December after a 12.4 percent rise in November. Sales rose annually for
the tenth month in a row.  
  
Online sales decreased 4.1 percent year-on-year in December, marking the
second decline in 2021. That said, levels of online sales in December
were still substantially higher than those seen in February 2020, before
