Sweden's industrial production grew only slightly in December,
reflecting the weakness in the motor vehicle industry, Statistics Sweden
reported Tuesday.

in the previous month.

Another report from the statistical office showed that industrial orders
dropped 5.1 percent month-on-month in December. Domestic orders
decreased 5.2 percent and foreign demand by 5.1 percent.

The largest decrease was recorded in the motor vehicle industry, down
17.5 percent, while the largest increase was recorded in the electronic
equipment industry, up 12.7 percent.

Compared with December 2020, total orders in industry decreased 7.7
percent.  
In a separate communiqu√©, the statistical office said household
consumption dropped 2.8 percent in December from November.

On a yearly basis, household spending grew 6.5 percent in December with
the biggest contribution from the sector restaurants, cafes, hotels and
other accommodation services.

In the fourth quarter, household consumption was up 7.1 percent from the
last year.

The labor force survey from Statistics Sweden, released today, showed
that the employment increased in the fourth quarter and the unemployment
rate dropped from the preceding quarter.

According to the seasonally adjusted and smoothed data, employment
increased compared with the third quarter and that there were 5.106
million persons employed in total.  
  
The unemployment rate was 8.3 percent, a decrease compared with the
third quarter.

In the fourth quarter, there were 410 000 unemployed persons aged
between 15 and 74 years, not seasonally adjusted. This corresponds to an
unemployment rate of 7.5 percent.
