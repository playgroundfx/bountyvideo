Malaysia's industrial production increased at a softer pace in December,
data from the Department of Statistics showed on Tuesday.

Industrial production rose 5.8 percent year-on-year in December, after a
9.4 percent increase in November. Economists had expected a 7.1 percent
growth.

The growth in production was mainly driven by a rise in production of
manufacturing industry and electricity.

Manufacturing output grew 8.4 percent yearly in December, after an 11.3
percent increase in the previous month.

Among other sectors, electricity output rose 3.7 percent, while mining
and quarrying output decreased 2.5 percent.

On a monthly basis, industrial production rose 1.3 percent in December.

In the fourth quarter, industrial production gained 6.9 percent yearly.
