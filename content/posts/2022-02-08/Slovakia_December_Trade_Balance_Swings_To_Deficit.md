Slovakia's foreign trade balance for December swung to a deficit from a
surplus a year ago as imports grew faster than exports, preliminary data
from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic showed Tuesday.  
  
The trade balance showed a deficit of EUR 255 million versus a surplus
of EUR 111.8 million in the same month of 2020. In November, the deficit
was EUR 31.2 million.  
  
Exports grew 18.5 percent year-on-year and imports rose 24.6 percent.  
  
For the whole year 2021, the trade balance had a surplus of EUR 1.692
billion versus EUR 3.317 billion in 2020. Exports rose 16.3 percent and
imports grew 19.3 percent.  
  
The statistical office attributed the export growth mainly to increased
shipments of motor vehicles and manufactured products. Growth in imports
was driven by a more than 50 percent jump in shipments of mineral fuels
in the backdrop of rising prices of gas, electricity and oil.  
  
Both the exports value and imports value hit record highs in 2021. The
trade surplus was around 60 percent higher than in the pre-pandemic year
of 2019.
