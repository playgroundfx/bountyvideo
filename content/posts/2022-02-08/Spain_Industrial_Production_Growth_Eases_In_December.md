Spain industrial production growth slowed in December, data published by
the statistical office INE showed on Tuesday.

Industrial output grew only 1.3 percent year-on-year in December, slower
than the 4.6 percent expansion seen in November.

Economists had forecast an annual growth of 4.4 percent. Nonetheless,
this was the second consecutive rise in production.

The slowdown was largely caused by the 3.3 percent decrease in the
production of capital goods. Meanwhile, consumer goods output grew
sharply by 6.2 percent. Output of intermediate goods and energy rose 1.3
percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.

On an unadjusted basis, industrial production gained 2.7 percent,
following a 5.4 percent rise in the previous month.

Month-on-month, industrial production dropped 2.6 percent in December.
