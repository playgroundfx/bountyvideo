With the value of imports increasing by slightly more than the value of
exports, the Commerce Department released a report on Tuesday showing
the U.S. trade deficit widened modestly in the month of December.

The Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $80.7 billion
in December from a revised $79.3 billion in November. The trade deficit
in December was just shy of the record $80.8 billion set in September.

Economists had expected the trade deficit to expand to $83.0 billion
from the $80.2 billion originally reported for the previous month.

The wider deficit came as the value of imports surged 1.6 percent to
$308.9 billion, while the value of exports jumped 1.5 percent to $228.1
billion.

Notable increases in imports of consumer goods, automotive vehicles,
parts and engines, and capital goods more than offset a significant
decrease in imports of industrial supplies and materials.

Meanwhile, the report showed increases in exports of consumer goods,
capital goods, automotive vehicles, parts and engines were partly offset
by a drop in exports of foods, feeds, and beverages.

"The solid gains in both exports and imports in December are a signal
that global supply chain problems are easing, although the further
widening in the trade deficit suggests that net trade will remain a drag
on GDP growth in the first quarter," said Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S.
Economist at Capital Economics.

The Commerce Department also said the goods deficit widened to $101.4
billion in December, while the services surplus increased to $20.7
billion.

For 2021, the goods and services deficit soared $182.4 billion or 27.0
percent from 2020. Exports spiked $394.1 billion or 18.5 percent, while
imports skyrocketed $576.5 billion or 20.5 percent.
