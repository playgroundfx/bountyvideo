UK retail sales grew in July after three months of sharp declines due to
the restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the [coronavirus][1],
the monthly Distributive Trades Survey data from the Confederation of
British Industry showed Monday.

The retail sales balance rose to +4 percent in July from -37 percent in
June. Economists had forecast the balance to improve moderately to -25
percent.

However, a net 5 percent expects sales to fall next month.

Alongside higher grocery volumes, sales of hardware & DIY products and
other normal goods returned to growth in the year to July.

"The re-opening of non-essential retail was a vital step towards
recovery but isn't a cure-all," Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist,
said.

"The Government has provided critical support for firms and jobs
throughout the crisis. But ongoing financial pressures are a major
challenge for some retailers, and additional direct support to shore up
cash flow, such as extension of [business][2] rates relief, should be
considered," the economist said.
