Lithuania's retail sales rose for the second straight month in June,
figures from the statistical office showed on Tuesday.

Retail sales, excluding VAT, increased a working-day adjusted 5.1
percent year-on-year in June, after a 0.9 percent rise in May.

Sales of non-food stores increased 5.5 percent annually in June and
sales in non-specialized stores rose 0.5 percent.

Sales of food, alcoholic beverages and tobacco increased 0.7 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, retail sales gained 5.6 percent in June.
Sales increased after the revocation of the quarantine measures related
to Covid-19 pandemic.

For the January to June period, retail sales declined by a working-day
adjusted 1.1 percent from the same period of the previous year.
