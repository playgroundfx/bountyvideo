Fitch Ratings maintained the sovereign ratings of China as the
[economy][1] logged a remarkable recovery from the downturn posed by the
coronavirus pandemic.

The rating agency retained the credit ratings at 'A+' with a 'stable'
outlook.

Fitch said the ratings were underpinned by strong external finances, a
track record of strong macroeconomic performance, and size as the
world's second-largest economy.

Nonetheless, the agency cited large structural vulnerabilities in the
financial sector, relatively low per capita income, and weaker
governance metrics than those of 'A' peers as major rating constraints.

Fitch observed that China's economy is staging a remarkable recovery
from the downturn caused by the [coronavirus][2] pandemic. According to
Fitch, real GDP will grow 2.7 percent this year instead of previously
estimated 1.2 percent.  
  
The annual growth is expected to accelerate temporarily to 7.5 percent
in 2021 before returning to the trend rate of 5.5 percent in 2022.

On a Fitch consolidated basis, the agency estimated the general
government deficit will rise to 11.1 percent of GDP this year, up
significantly from 4.9 percent in 2019, though not dissimilar to the
scale of fiscal deterioration globally this year.
