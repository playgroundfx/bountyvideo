Partly reflecting a jump in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing new orders
for U.S. manufactured durable goods increased by more than expected in
the month of November.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders climbed by 0.9 percent
in November after spiking by an upwardly revised 1.8 percent in October.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to rise by 0.6 percent
compared to the 1.3 percent jump that had been reported for the previous
month.

Excluding orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose
by 0.4 percent in November after surging up by 1.9 percent in October.
Ex-transportation orders had been expected to increase by 0.5 percent.
