The Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing a steep
drop in U.S. personal income in the month of November.

The report said personal income slumped by 1.1 percent in November after
falling by a revised 0.6 percent in October.

Economists had expected personal income to dip by 0.3 percent compared
to the 0.7 percent drop originally reported for the previous month.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, also tumbled by 1.2 percent in November following a 0.7 percent
decrease in October.

The bigger than expected drop in personal income came as federal
economic recovery payments slowed as pandemic-related assistance
programs continued to wind down.

The Commerce Department said personal spending also fell by 0.4 percent
in November after rising by 0.3 percent in October.

Personal spending was expected to edge down by 0.2 percent compared to
the 0.5 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

Excluding price changes, personal spending still declined by 0.4 percent
in November after rising by 0.3 percent in October.

"Despite the monthly contraction in spending, we expect real consumer
spending will advance around 1.0% in Q4 (just over 4% annualized)
supported by strong end-of-summer momentum," said Gregory Daco, Chief
U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

He added, "Still, the [economy][1] is entering 2021 with very little
dynamism, and the urgency of passing the Covid relief package cannot be
understated."

With income falling by much more than spending, personal saving as a
percentage of disposable income dropped to 12.9 percent in November from
13.6 percent in October.
