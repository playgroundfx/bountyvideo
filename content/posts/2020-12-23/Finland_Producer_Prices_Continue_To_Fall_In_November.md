Finland's producer prices continued to decline in November, data from
Statistics Finland showed on Wednesday.

Producer prices decreased 4.6 percent year-on-year in November,
following a 5.4 percent decline in October.

On a month-on-month basis, producer prices rose 0.7 percent in November,
after a 0.2 percent decline in the prior month.

The decline in the producer prices for manufactured products was
particularly attributable to fallen prices of oil products, electricity,
and pulp, paper, paperboard and cardboard from November last year.

Import prices declined 7.1 percent annually in November and export
prices fell by 5.7 percent.
