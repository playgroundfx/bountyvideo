Singapore's consumer prices declined at a softer pace in November, data
from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and
Industry showed on Wednesday.

The consumer price index fell 0.1 percent year-on-year in November,
after a 0.2 percent decline in October. Economists had expected a 0.2
percent fall.

This latest consumer prices outcome was largely due to a smaller decline
in prices for services, and electricity and gas, as well as a higher
food inflation.

MAS core CPI, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, fell 0.1 percent annually in November, following a 0.2
percent decrease in the preceding month. This was in line with
economists' expectation.

The statistical office expects external inflation to remain low in the
coming quarters, amid weak demand conditions.

Both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are forecast to
average between -0.5 percent and 0 percent this year, the statistical
office and MAS said.

Next year, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average 0-1 percent, while
the CPI-All Items inflation is projected to be between -0.5 and 0.5
percent.
