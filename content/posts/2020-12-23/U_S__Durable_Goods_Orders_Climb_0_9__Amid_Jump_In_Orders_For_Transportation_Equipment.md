Partly reflecting a jump in orders for transportation equipment, the
Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing new orders
for U.S. manufactured durable goods increased by more than expected in
the month of November.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders climbed by 0.9 percent
in November after spiking by an upwardly revised 1.8 percent in October.

Economists had expected durable goods orders to rise by 0.6 percent
compared to the 1.3 percent jump that had been reported for the previous
month.

The bigger than expected increase in durable goods orders was partly due
to continued growth in orders for transportation equipment, which surged
up by 1.9 percent in November after shooting up by 1.5 percent in
October.

Orders for defense aircraft and parts helped lead the leader higher,
soaring by 15.7 percent in November after skyrocketing by 71.3 percent
in October.

Excluding the jump in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods
orders rose by 0.4 percent in November after surging up by 1.9 percent
in October. Ex-transportation orders had been expected to increase by
0.5 percent.

Significant increases in orders for computers and related products and
communications equipment were partly offset by a drop in orders for
fabricated metal products.

The report said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft,
a key indicator of [business][1] spending, rose by 0.4 percent in
November after jumping by 1.6 percent in October.

"Core orders notched another gain last month, but signal moderating
business investment growth," said Oren Klachkin, Lead U.S. Economist at
Oxford Economics.

He added, "Factory output will stay well-supported in the new year, but
the recovery's dynamics will favor a pickup in services activity at the
expense of goods."
