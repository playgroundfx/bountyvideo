First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits showed a significant
pullback in the week ended December 19th, the Labor Department revealed
in a report released on Wednesday.

The report said initial jobless claims slid to 803,000, a decrease of
89,000 from the previous week's revised level of 892,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to come in unchanged compared to
the 885,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving
average inched up to 818,250, an increase of 4,000 from the previous
week's revised average of 814,250.
