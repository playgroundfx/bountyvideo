A report released by the University of Michigan on Wednesday showed U.S.
consumer sentiment improved by less than initially estimated in the
month of December.

The report said the consumer sentiment index for December was downwardly
revised to 80.7 from the previously reported 81.4.

While economists had expected a more modest downward revision to 81.3,
the index remains well above the final November reading of 76.9.

"The Sentiment Index slipped in late December, although it remained
higher than last month despite the ongoing surge in covid infections and
deaths," said Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin.

He added, "The improvement was due to a large and rapid partisan shift,
with Democrats becoming much more positive and Republicans much more
negative."

The report said current economic conditions index rose to 90.0 in
December from 87.0 in November, while the index of consumer expectations
climbed to 74.6 from 70.5.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations slid to 2.5
percent in December from 2.8 percent in November. Five-year inflation
expectations were unchanged at 2.5 percent.
