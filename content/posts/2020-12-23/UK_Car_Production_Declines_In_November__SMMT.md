UK car production declined in November, data released by the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, or SMMT, showed Wednesday.

Car manufacturing decreased 1.4 percent annually to 106,243 units in
November.

Output for domestic [markets][1] dropped 10.4 percent, while that for
exports gained marginally by 0.3 percent.

The annual decline in production masks a particularly weak November 2019
when precautionary factory shutdowns in anticipation of a potential 'no
deal' Brexit on October 31, depressed output.

Year-to-date production was down -31.0 percent with 380,809 fewer cars
manufactured in 2020. This puts the industry on course to produce fewer
than a million cars this year for only the second time since the early
eighties, the lobby noted.

Around 85 percent of cars built in November were manufactured for
exports, highlighting the critical importance of free and fair trade
with global markets to UK car makers.

Yet another decline for UK car production is of course concerning, but
not nearly as concerning as the New Year nightmare facing the automotive
industry if we do not get a Brexit deal that works for the sector, Mike
Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said.

"With just nine days to go, the threat of 'no deal' is palpable and the
sector, now also reeling from the latest [coronavirus][2] resurgence,
Tier 4 showroom lockdowns and disruption at critical UK ports, needs
more than ever the tariff-free trading arrangements on which our
competitiveness is founded, Hawes added.
