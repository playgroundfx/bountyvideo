A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on
Thursday showed an unexpected acceleration in the pace of growth in
regional manufacturing activity in the month of April.

The Philly Fed said its index for current manufacturing activity rose to
50.2 in April from a downwardly revised 44.5 in March, with a positive
reading indicating growth.

The increase surprised economists, who had expected the index to drop to
42.0 from the 51.8 originally reported for the previous month.

With the unexpected increase, the Philly Fed's manufacturing index
reached its highest level since hitting 53.6 in April of 1973.

The report showed an acceleration in the pace of job growth, as the
number of employees index rose to a record high 30.8 in April from 27.4
in March.

The shipments index also climbed to 25.3 in April from 22.0 in March,
although the new orders index dipped to 36.0 in April from 38.2 in
March.

Meanwhile, the Philly Fed said the prices paid index fell to 69.1 in
April after reaching a 40-year high of 72.6 in March.

The prices received index increased to 34.5 in April from 30.2 in March,
as firms reported overall increases in prices for their own manufactured
goods

Looking ahead, the diffusion index for future general activity climbed
to 66.6 in April from 59.1 in March, reaching its highest reading since
October 1991.

A separate report released by the New York Federal Reserve showed New
York manufacturing activity grew strongly in the month of April.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index climbed
to 26.3 in April from 17.4 in March. Economists had expected the index
to inch up to 19.5.

With the much bigger than expected increase, the general business
conditions index reached its highest level since hitting 26.6 in October
of 2017.
