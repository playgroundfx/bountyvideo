British lenders expect demand for secured lending as well as the
availability of secured credit to households to increase in the next
three months to end-May, the Credit Conditions Survey results from the
Bank of England showed on Thursday.

The availability of secured credit to households increased in three
months to end-February, while demand for secured lending for both house
purchase and remortgaging decreased in the first quarter.

Lenders reported that the availability of unsecured credit to households
decreased slightly in the first quarter, but was expected to increase
over the next quarter. At the same time, demand for unsecured lending
was unchanged in the first quarter, but was expected to increase in the
second quarter.

Banks said the overall availability of credit to the corporate sector
was unchanged in the first quarter, while overall availability was
expected to increase slightly in the coming three months.

Lenders revealed a fall in demand for corporate lending from small
businesses in the first quarter, whereas demand from large businesses
increased.

Demand from medium-sized businesses was unchanged over the same period.
Demand for corporate lending was expected to increase across all
[business][1] sizes in the second quarter.

The survey was conducted between March 1 and 19.
