Retail sales in the U.S. spiked by much more than expected in the month
of March, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on
Thursday.

The Commerce Department said retail sales skyrocketed by 9.8 percent in
March after tumbling by a revised 2.7 percent in February.

Economists had expected retail sales to surge up by 5.9 percent compared
to the 3.0 percent slump originally reported for the previous month.

The stronger than expected retail sales growth was partly due to a jump
in sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, which soared by 15.1
percent in March after plunging by 3.5 percent in February.

However, excluding the rebound in auto sales, retail sales still spiked
by 8.4 percent in March after tumbling by a revised 2.5 percent in
February. Ex-auto sales were expected to jump by 5.0 percent.

The report showed substantial increases in sales by sporting goods,
hobby, musical instrument, and book stores, clothing and accessories
stores and food service and drinking places.

"Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down
just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in
February 2020," said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital
Economics.

He added, "That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and
easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid
return to normalcy."

Closely watched core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline,
building materials and food services, also surged up by 6.9 percent in
March after slumping by 3.4 percent in February.
