Separate reports released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday showed faster
growth in regional manufacturing activity in the month of April.

The New York Fed said its general [business][1] conditions index climbed
to 26.3 in April from 17.4 in March, with a positive reading indicating
growth in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the
index to inch up to 19.5.

Meanwhile, the Philly Fed said its index for current manufacturing
activity rose to 50.2 in April from a downwardly revised 44.5 in March.

The increase surprised economists, who had expected the index to drop to
42.0 from the 51.8 originally reported for the previous month.
