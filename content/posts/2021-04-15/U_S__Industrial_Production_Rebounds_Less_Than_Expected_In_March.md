After reporting a sharp pullback in U.S. industrial production in the
previous month, the Federal Reserve released a report on Thursday
showing production rebounded in the month of March.

The Fed said industrial production jumped by 1.4 percent in March after
plunging by a downwardly revised 2.6 percent in February.

The rebound fell short of expectations, however, as economists had
expected production to spike by 2.8 percent compared to the 2.2 percent
slump originally reported for the previous month.

"Industrial output did recover following weather-related disruptions in
February, but the scale of the bounce-back was a little disappointing,"
said James Knightley, Chief International Economist at ING.

He added, "A significant proportion of this can be blamed on
semiconductor shortages, but as this situation improves, the
manufacturing sectors looks set to roar back strongly."

The increase in industrial production came as manufacturing output
surged up by 2.7 percent in March after tumbling by 3.7 percent in
February, while mining output soared by 5.7 percent after plummeting by
5.6 percent.

Meanwhile, the report showed an 11.4 percent nosedive in utilities
output in March following a 9.2 percent spike in February, as the demand
for heating fell because of a swing in temperatures.

The Fed also said capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose to
74.4 percent in March from a downwardly revised 73.4 in February.

Economists had expected capacity utilization to climb to 75.7 percent
from the 73.8 percent originally reported for the previous month.

Capacity utilization in the manufacturing and mining sectors increased
to 73.8 percent and 82.2 percent, respectively, while capacity
utilization in the utilities sector slid to 68.8 percent.
