The UK housing market is set for a closer to normal trend during 2022,
following a hectic eighteen months, the property [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Rightmove
forecast on Monday.

The agency said a better balance of supply and demand will suit more
hesitant movers who may have held back from this year's frenzied market.

Data showed that there was a seasonal fall in house prices in December,
down 0.7 percent from the previous month compared to a 0.6 percent drop
this time a year ago.

On a yearly basis, house prices advanced 6.3 percent in December, the
same rate as seen in November.

Rightmove forecast house prices to climb 5 percent next year.

"A rise in interest rates is likely next year, and whilst a rise is
often regarded as unhelpful to the market, a slowing of the fast pace of
sales, and associated pace of price rises, will help the return to more
normality that will suit many movers," Tim Bannister, Rightmove's
director of property data, said.

Bannister said buyer demand and market momentum remain strong going into
2022, with November showing buyer numbers 41 percent up on the election-
subdued 2019, and still 3 percent up on booming 2020.
