Ireland's construction sector continued to expand in November with new
order growth hitting a three-month high, survey data from IHS Markit
showed on Monday.

The Ulster Bank construction Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 56.3
in November, but down from 56.9 in October. However, the score still
indicates a sharp monthly increase in total activity.

All three broad categories of construction posted expansion for the
first time in four months in November. Civil engineering returned to
growth and rates of growth in housing and commercial activity remained
marked.

New order growth picked up to a three-month high in November. Due to
higher workloads, construction firms expanded their staffing levels for
the eighth consecutive month.

Input costs continued to rise at a considerable pace in November.

Companies remained optimistic that activity will continue to rise over
the coming year. Expectations of further improvements in customer demand
were central to hopes for growth of activity.
