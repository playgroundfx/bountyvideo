Germany's wholesale prices grew the most since 1962 in November driven
by higher prices for raw materials and intermediate goods, data released
by Destatis showed on Monday.

Wholesale prices increased 16.6 percent year-on-year in November, after
climbing 15.2 percent in October. This was the fastest inflation since
1962.

On a monthly basis, wholesale price growth eased to 1.3 percent from 1.6
percent in October.

There was a sharp increase in prices of many raw materials and
intermediate products in November, Destatis said. Wholesale prices of
petroleum products showed an annual growth of 62.4 percent.
