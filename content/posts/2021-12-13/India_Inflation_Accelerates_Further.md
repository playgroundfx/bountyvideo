India's inflation accelerated again in November, driven by steep
increases in food and fuel prices, preliminary data from the statistics
ministry showed Monday.

The consumer price index rose 4.91 percent year-on-year following a 4.48
percent increase in the previous month. Economists had forecast 5.10
inflation. A year ago, inflation was 6.93 percent.

The food price inflation accelerated to 1.87 percent from 0.85 percent.

Compared to the previous month, the CPI rose 0.73 percent in November
and the food price index climbed 1.32 percent.

Prices of food and beverages rose 2.60 percent annually and those of
fuel and light grew 13.35 percent. Housing costs climbed 3.66 percent
and prices of clothing and footwear increased 7.94 percent.

The Reserve Bank of India expects price pressures to persist in the
immediate term. Following the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session on December 8, RBI Governor
Shaktikanta Das said inflation prints are likely to be somewhat higher
as base effects turn adverse.

Headline inflation is forecast to peak in the March quarter of 2022 and
soften thereafter. The central bank maintained its inflation outlook at
5.3 percent for the fiscal year 2021-22.
