The UK construction sector expanded at the fastest pace since 2015
driven by house building in July, survey data from IHS Markit showed
Thursday.

The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction
Purchasing Managers' Index rose more-than-expected to 58.1 in July from
55.3 in June. The reading was forecast to rise to 57.0.

Residential building was the main growth driver in July, with activity
increasing to the greatest extent since September 2014. At the same
time, commercial work and civil engineering activity both expanded at
slightly quicker rates.

New orders picked up for the second consecutive month, with survey
respondents commenting on a boost to sales from easing lockdown measures
and the restart of work on site.

Construction firms were optimistic overall about the prospect of a
recovery in [business][1] activity during the next 12 months.

However, worries about the speed of recovery contributed to a sustained
decline in staffing numbers in July.

On the price front, the survey showed that input cost inflation reached
its highest level since May 2019.

After a summer of this blistering return to growth, building companies
should prepare for a chilly autumn as furlough schemes come to an end
and the real strength of the UK [economy][2] is revealed, Duncan Brock,
group director at the CIPS, said.
