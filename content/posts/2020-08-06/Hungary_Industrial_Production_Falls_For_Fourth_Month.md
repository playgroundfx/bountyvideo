Hungary's industrial production declined for the fourth consecutive
month in June, but at a slower pace, data from the Hungarian Central
Statistical Office showed on Thursday.

Industrial production declined a working-day adjusted 12.2 percent year-
on-year in June, following a 27.8 percent decrease in May.

The effects of the economic processes caused by the [coronavirus][1]
epidemic were still perceptible in this period, the agency said.

On a non-adjusted basis, industrial production decreased 7.8 percent
annually in June, following a 30.9 percent fall in the preceding month.

A significant fall was observed in the manufacture of transport
equipment, while the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical
products, and food products, beverages and tobacco products grew
slightly, the agency said.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production rose 17.1 percent
monthly in June, following 16.1 percent increase in the prior month.
