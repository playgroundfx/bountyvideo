The Bank of England [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers left the interest rate at a record low
and quantitative easing unchanged after easing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) considerably since
the onset of the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

In the accompanying Monetary Policy Report, the bank cautioned that
unemployment will rise drastically and the economic and inflation
outlook depends critically on the evolution of the pandemic.

The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee unanimously voted to hold the
interest rate at 0.10 percent, as widely expected. The bank had
altogether reduced the rate by 65 basis points at two unscheduled
meetings in March.

The bank retained the size of the asset purchase programme at GBP 745
billion. All members judged that the existing stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
was appropriate.

Markets expect the BoE to bring key rates to negative zone like its
other major counterparts, namely the European Central Bank and the Bank
of Japan.

At the August meeting, BoE [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers said the negative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rates
at this time could be less effective as a tool to stimulate the
[economy][2].

The MPC said it does not intend to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until there
is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating
spare capacity and achieving the 2 percent inflation target sustainably.

"The BoE still has the door open for further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action - probably at
the November meeting when a new MPR is released and we will know more
about the UK's future relationship with the EU," Chris Turner and
Antoine Bouvet, economists at ING, said.

The outlook remains unusually uncertain, the bank said. It will depend
critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect
public [health][3], and how governments, households and businesses
respond to these factors.

GDP is expected to have been over 20 percent lower in the second quarter
of 2020 than in the fourth quarter of 2019. Economic output is not
projected to exceed its level in the fourth quarter of 2019 until the
end of 2021.

According to the central bank, the fall in the second quarter GDP is
expected to be less severe than assumed in the May Report. Inflation is
forecast to turn briefly negative in the near term, falling to -0.3
percent in August.

Inflation will fall further below the 2 percent target and average
around 0.25 percent in the latter part of the year, largely reflecting
the direct and indirect effects of Covid-19, the bank said. Nonetheless,
in two years' time, inflation is forecast to be around 2 percent.

Employment has fallen since the Covid-19 outbreak. In the near term, the
unemployment rate is projected to rise materially, to around 7.5 percent
by the end of the year.
