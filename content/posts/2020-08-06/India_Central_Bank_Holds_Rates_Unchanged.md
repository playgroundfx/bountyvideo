The Reserve Bank of India left its key interest rates unchanged on
Thursday, defying expectations for a quarter-point reduction, as tries
to keep inflation in check after the [economy][1] started showing signs
of recovery after businesses started opening up following the relaxation
of the lockdown restricitions to battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The Monetary Policy Committee decided to hold the repo rate unchanged at
4 percent, the central bank said in a statement.

The reverse repo rate was held steady at 3.35 percent and the marginal
standing facility rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 percent.

"The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long
as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19
on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target
going forward," the bank said.
