The Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates below zero anytime
soon, Governor Andrew Bailey said Thursday.

Negative rates are part of the toolbox, Bailey said. "But at the moment
we do not have a plan to use them."

Earlier in the day, the bank had retained its interest rate at a record
low 0.10 percent and retained the size of the asset purchase programme
at GBP 745 billion.

The bank had projected the jobless rate to rise materially, to around
7.5 percent by the end of the year. Bailey said this is a very bad story
for the UK.
