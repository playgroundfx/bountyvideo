Finland's producer prices continued to decline in July, albeit at a
softer pace, figures from Statistics Finland showed on Monday.

The producer price index declined 5.0 percent year-on-year in July,
following a 4.4 percent fall in June.

The latest drop in the producer prices was particularly attributable to
a fall in prices of oil products, electricity, pulp, paper, paperboard
and cardboard, as well as iron and steel from a year ago, the agency
said.

On a monthly basis, producer prices fell 0.1 percent in July, after a
1.8 percent rise in the preceding month.

Data also showed that the import prices fell 6.8 percent annually in
July, and export prices declined 5.0 percent.

On a month-on-month basis, import prices and export prices rose 0.5
percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.
