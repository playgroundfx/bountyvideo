Singapore's consumer prices rose in February, data from the Monetary
Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed on
Tuesday.

The consumer price index rose 0.7 year-on-year in February, following a
0.2 percent increase in January. Economists had expected a 0.6 percent
rise.

This latest consumer prices outcome was largely due to a rise in core
inflation and prices for private transportation cost.

MAS core CPI, which excludes costs of accommodation and private road
transport, grew 0.2 percent annually in February, reversing a 0.2
percent decrease in the preceding month.

The statistical office expects external inflation to rise in the coming
quarters, amid a recovery in global oil prices.

Domestic cost pressures are expected to stay low, as wage growth and
commercial rent are likely to remain subdued.

For 2021, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average 0-1 percent, while
the CPI-All Items inflation is reviewed given then recent sharper-than-
expected increase in the prices of the non-core items.
