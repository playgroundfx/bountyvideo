Severe recession caused by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic is set to lead
to a deterioration in bank asset quality in the euro area, the Chair of
the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank Andrea Enria said
Tuesday.  
  
The impact will be more "prominent in sectors most affected by the
pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures" and could reflect
differences in the strength and speed of the recovery across areas of
[business][2], Enria said at a hearing in the European Parliament.  
  
As part of the ECB's Covid-19 credit risk strategy, bank supervisors
will closely investigate and monitor potential cliff-edge effects in
asset quality that could occur once public support measures related to
COVID-19 are withdrawn, Enria said.  
  
The ECB has also asked banks to adequately prepare for the upcoming
increase in nonperforming loans, or NPLs.  
  
In an environment of low interest rates and rising credit losses, there
is no one-size-fits all structural solution for banks, Enria said. The
central banker urged banks to adjust their business models to ensure
their sustainability in such conditions.  
  
Enria also said that the ECB plans to ask all banks to provide it with
their suitability assessments of board members before making
appointments.  
  
The ECB supervisory board will give greater consideration to any
supervisory findings related to positions previously held by the
candidates, as well the specific needs of the banks, the top official
said.

The central bank will further clarify the way in which it reassess
sitting board members, if new relevant facts emerge which could affect
their suitability, Enria added.  
  
The ECB official also said that a climate risk stress test will be
carried out in 2022, which will allow a review of banks' practices in
this area and take concrete follow-up measures where needed.  
  
The ECB will also set up a climate change center that will pool staff
with data and climate expertise in workstreams that cover both the
banking supervision and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/).

Ernria also urged banks to allocate enough staff and assets to
institutions inside the banking union post-Brexit. This is necessary to
ensure adequate management of risks both in and from Europe, the Italian
economist said.
