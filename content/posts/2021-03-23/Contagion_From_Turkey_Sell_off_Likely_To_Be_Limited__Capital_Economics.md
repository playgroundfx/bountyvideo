The sell-off in Turkish assets and the currency following the decision
of President Tayyip Erdogan to remove the central bank governor is set
to continue over the coming weeks, but the contagion to other emerging
[markets][1] is likely to be moderate, John Higgins, an economist at
Capital Economics, said.

Erdogan appointed Sahap Kavcioglu as new governor over the weekend,
replacing Naci Agbal, who was at the helm of the central bank only for
four months.  
  
The surprise announcement came after the central bank resorted to a
larger-than-expected 200 basis point rate hike on Thursday. During
Agbal's tenure, the key one-week repo rate was raised by 875 basis
points.

The new governor Kavcioglu has expressed sympathy for Erdogan's unusual
view that high interest rates lead to high inflation.

In a statement, Kavcioglu said the central bank will continue to use the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools effectively in line with its main objective of
achieving a permanent fall in inflation.

The decline in inflation will foster macroeconomic stability through the
fall in country risk premiums and a permanent improvement in financing
costs, and will contribute to the development of conditions essential
for sustainable growth that will enhance investment, production, exports
and employment, Kavcioglu added.  
  
Capital Economics had forecast the lira to strengthen in 2021 and
Turkish assets to gain ground assuming a shift in Turkey's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)making
towards more aggressive inflation fighting - of which the appointment of
Agbal was an integral part. Events over the weekend have made clear that
this would not be the case, the economist noted.

The lira and Turkish assets are set to fall further this year as
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will probably be looser and inflation higher than
previously expected, which would directly hurt the lira and local-
currency government bonds, said Higgins.

The economist said the fall-out in other EMs from turmoil in Turkey's
financial markets has been limited mainly due to two reasons.

Higgins said Turkey's difficulties are clearly idiosyncratic in nature.
Moreover, most other major EMs have reduced their external
vulnerabilities during the [coronavirus][2] crisis.

Second, foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s reduced their exposure to Turkey following the
2018 currency crisis, so it seems unlikely that sharp drops in the
prices of Turkish assets will force them to sell other EM assets to
cover their losses, the economist observed.
