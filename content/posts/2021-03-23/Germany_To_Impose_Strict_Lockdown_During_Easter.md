German Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders of 16 federal
states agreed late Monday to impose a hard lockdown during Easter amid
an exponential growth in the number of [coronavirus][1] cases in the
country, in what is being called a "third wave".

Shops, grocery stores and other establishments will remain shut from
April 1 for five days.

Churches must conduct prayer services online. Food stores will be
allowed to open on April 3, Saturday.

The government also decided to apply the hard lockdown "emergency brake"
in regions with an incidence value above 100 for a seven-day period.

Germany also extended the current lockdown measures, which includes
partial shutdown of non-essential stores, until April 18.

"We are in a very, very serious situation", Merkel said in a press
conference following her meeting with the regional leaders. She said
there is a new pandemic caused by a new virus which is more deadly and
more infectious.

Several other European countries have also delayed plans for a gradual
opening of the [economy][2] in the backdrop of the rising coronavirus
cases and slower vaccinations.

The Robert Koch Institute reported on Monday that the national seven-day
rate of infections climbed to 107 per 100,000 people, which is above the
100-threshold that signals strain on [health][3] care establishments.

The government had planned to withdraw the partial lockdown measures
applied since March 3 if the average rate of infections remained above
100 for three days in a row.

The number of confirmed cases in Germany on Monday increased by 7,709 to
2,667,225, Deutsche Welle [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) service reported. The death toll climbed
by 50 to 74,714.

The coronavirus vaccine roll-out in Europe has been marred with numerous
delays. The latest cause for delay is the concern that the Oxford-
AstraZeneca vaccine, one of the several in the market, could lead to
blood clots in some recipients. Several countries have suspended the
vaccine.

Commerzbank Chief Economist Jorg Kramer assumes that the lockdown will
remain in force in its current or slightly weakened form until the end
of May. Consequently, the bank has discarded its expectation for an
early economic recovery and lowered its growth forecast for this year
from 4.5 percent to 3.5 percent.
