UK manufacturers expect output to pick up rapidly over the coming three
months, the Industrial Trends Survey from the Confederation of British
Industry showed on Tuesday.

A balance of +30 percent expects output to pick up in the coming three
months, the strongest expectations since August 2017.

A net 3 percent respondent said output increased in three months to
March versus -8 percent in February.

The order book balance rose to -5 percent from -24 percent in February.
This was the strongest position since April 2019.

Similarly, the export order books balance advanced to -20 percent from
-39 percent a month ago.

It's great to see the mood lift among manufacturers, buoyed by a jump in
order books, Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said. But firms
continue to grapple with higher freight costs as well as raw material
shortages.

"Looking ahead, the Government should remain focussed on measures to
reinforce a recovery, with an eye to boosting the UK's competitiveness
over the long-term," Leach added. "Rapid progress in the rollout of the
vaccine will be crucial in driving a recovery [business][1] confidence."
