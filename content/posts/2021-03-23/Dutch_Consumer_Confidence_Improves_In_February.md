The Netherlands' consumer confidence improved slightly in March, but
remained negative, data from the Central Bureau of Statistics showed on
Tuesday.

Another report from the statistical office showed that household
spending declined further in January, as consumers spend less on
services.

The consumer confidence index rose to -18 in March from -19 in February.
The score was below the 20-year average of -7 points.

Among components, the economic climate index fell to -41 in March from
-39 in February. The assessment of the future economic climate was less
negative and consumers' opinion on the past economic situation was more
negative.

The indicator for willingness to buy rose -4 in March from -5 in the
previous month.

Consumer spending declined 13.5 percent yearly in January, following a
11.9 percent fall in December. This was the eleventh consecutive fall.
