South Africa's composite leading index increased in January, survey data
from the South African Reserve Bank showed on Tuesday.

The composite leading index rose 2.1 percent month-on-month to 117.5 in
January from 115.1 in December. Compared to a year ago, the increase was
13.6 percent versus 10.8 percent in the previous month.

Among the ten available components, increases in four outweighed
decreases in the remaining six.

The largest contribution came from an acceleration in the 12-month rate
of increase in job advertisement space and an increase in the US dollar-
denominated South African export commodity price index.

The coincident index increased by 0.3 percent month-to-month basis 93.4
in December from 93.1 in November.

The lagging indicator rose 1.1 percent monthly to 88.3 in December from
87.4 in the prior month.
