Sweden's manufacturing activity grew above the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average for
the second straight month in October, survey data from Swedbank and the
logistics group SILF showed on Monday.

The purchasing managers' index rose to 58.2 in October from revised 55.9
in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the sector.

"The spread of the [coronavirus][1] has not yet affected the Swedish
industrial [economy][2] or companies' production plans, but the downside
risks have significantly increased," Swedbank analyst Jorgen Kennemar
said.

Four of the five sub-indices rose in October. Sub-indexes for order
intake, delivery time and production increased above the level of 60 for
the first time since 2017.

Production plans for the next six months were more expensive in October.
