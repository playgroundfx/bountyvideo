Construction spending in the U.S. increased by less than expected in the
month of September, the Commerce Department revealed in a report
released on Monday.

The report said construction spending rose by 0.3 percent to an annual
rate of $1.414 trillion in September after climbing by 0.8 percent to
$1.410 trillion in August. Economists had expected construction spending
to jump by 1.0 percent.

The weaker than expected growth in construction spending came as an
increase in spending on private construction was partly offset by a drop
in spending on public construction.

The Commerce Department said spending on private construction climbed by
0.9 percent to an annual rate of $1.075 trillion, with a spike in
spending on residential construction more than offsetting a slump in
spending on non-residential construction.

Meanwhile, the report said spending on public construction tumble by 1.7
percent to an annual rate of $339.1 billion amid a steep drop in
spending on highway construction.
