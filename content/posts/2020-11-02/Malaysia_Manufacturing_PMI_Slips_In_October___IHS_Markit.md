The manufacturing sector in Malaysia continued to contract, and at a
faster pace, the latest survey from IHS Markit revealed on Monday with a
manufacturing PMI score of 48.5.

That's down from 49.0 in September, and it moves further beneath the
boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, a renewed increase among Covid-19 cases served to
undermine demand. Output was scaled back for the second straight month
as the decline in exports increased.

Confidence in the 12-monthg outlook dipped. Weaker new order inflows
meant that firms were able to deplete their backlogs of work.
