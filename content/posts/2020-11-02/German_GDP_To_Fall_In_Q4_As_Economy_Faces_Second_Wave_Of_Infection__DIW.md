The German [economy][1] is set to contract in the fourth quarter as the
government decided to restrict activity to curb the second wave of
infections, the DIW institute said Monday.

Gross domestic product is forecast to shrink 1 percent in the fourth
quarter after rebounding 8.2 percent in the third quarter.

Although industry is likely to be less affected than in the first half
of the year, consumer oriented service sectors such as the hospitality
industry will be most affected, the institute said.

According to institute, an additional 400,000 employees are expected to
be put on short-time work.

If Germany succeeds in limiting the spread of Covid-19, the economy can
grow again in the coming year. Otherwise, the economic damage could be
significantly greater.
