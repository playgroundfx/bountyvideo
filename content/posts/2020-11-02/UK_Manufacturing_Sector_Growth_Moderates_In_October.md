The UK manufacturing sector continued to expand in October but the
upturn showed signs of losing impetus as the initial boost to growth
from the [economy][1] reopening faded and job losses accelerated, final
survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday.  
  
The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply factory
Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.7 in October from 54.1 in the
previous month. The flash score was 53.3. A score above 50 indicates
expansion.

Manufacturing output climbed further though the growth eased to a four-
month low in October. The improvement was linked to catching up of new
orders. Reflecting rise in demand from China and the US, new export
[business][2] strengthened.

On the other hand, employment declined for the ninth straight month due
to recruitment freezes, the non-replacement of leavers, cost reduction
strategies and workforce restructuring.

On the price front, the survey showed that the rate of increase in input
prices accelerated to its highest since December 2018. Part of the
increase was passed on to clients in the form of higher output charges.

Manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in October. Positive
sentiment reflected hopes of economic recovery and a reduction in
Covid-19 disruption.

Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said while most companies maintain
a positive outlook, with three-fifths of manufacturers expecting output
to rise over the coming year, concerns about near-term risks posed by
the pandemic, changes to Covid restrictions and related stimulus
measures, plus Brexit anxieties, continue to fog the future.
