Growth in U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated by much more than
expected in the month of October, according to a report released by the
Institute For Supply Management on Monday.

The ISM said its purchasing managers index climbed to 59.3 in October
from 55.4 in September, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in
manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the index to inch up to
55.8.

"Manufacturing performed well for the third straight month, with demand,
consumption and inputs registering growth indicative of a normal
expansion cycle," said Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing
Business Survey Committee.

He added, "While certain industry sectors are experiencing difficulties
that will continue in the near term, the overall manufacturing community
continues to exceed expectations."

The bigger than expected increase by the headline index came as the new
orders index jumped to 67.9 in October from 60.2 in September and the
production index rose 63.0 from 61.0.

The employment index also climbed to 53.2 in October from 49.6 in
September, indicating job growth in the manufacturing sector.

The report said the prices index also increased to 65.5 in October from
62.8 in September, pointing to a continued increase in prices.

On Wednesday, the ISM is scheduled to release a separate report on
activity In the service sector in the month of October.
