Turkey's manufacturing sectora activity continued to increase in
October, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The Istanbul Chamber of Industry Turkey manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 53.9 in October from 52.8 in September.
Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

New orders rose for the fifth straight month in October and export
demand expanded.

Firms increased their production volumes in October. Output and delivery
of production rose and backlogs of work fell for the third straight
month.

Staffing level increased in October and the rate of job creation
quickened to the strongest since February 2018.

Purchasing activities increased in October, while stocks of inputs
declined.

Input costs and output prices rose sharply in October as the Turkish
lira weakened further. Input costs rose at the fastest pace in two
years.

"In fact, IHS Markit now expects industrial production to fall just 0.8
percent over the course 2020 despite the collapse in output earlier in
the year due to COVID-19," Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS
Markit, said.

"This positive picture is all in spite of ongoing currency weakness
which is causing inflationary pressures to build," Harker added.
