Russia's manufacturing sector contracted in October, amid a fall in
production and a quicker contraction in new orders, survey data from IHS
Markit showed on Monday.

The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Russia Manufacturing
purchasing managers' index fell to 46.9 in October from 48.9 in
September.

A PMI reading below 50 suggest contraction in activity.

New orders inflow declined at the fastest pace in five months in
October, while new export orders rose for the first time since December
2018.

Business confidence decreased to the lowest since May and output grew
for the coming 12 months.

Employment declined at a solid rate in October with the rate of job
shedding faster than the series average. Backlogs of woks depleted, with
the pace of contraction accelerating to a strong rate.

Input buying contracted in October and suppliers' delivery time
lengthened amid shortage in raw materials.

Input prices increase at the sharpest pace since August 2018 and selling
prices rose steeply. The rate of charge inflation was the quickest since
February last year.

"Our latest forecast anticipates that the Russian manufacturing sector
will remain in contraction until the second quarter of 2021, as
challenging domestic demand and ongoing uncertainty regarding the
pandemic are expected to weigh on the recovery," Sian Jones, economist
at IHS Markit, said.
