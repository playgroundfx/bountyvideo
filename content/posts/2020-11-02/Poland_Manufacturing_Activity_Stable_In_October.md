Poland's manufacturing sector growth remained unchanged in October,
survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, remained unchanged
at 50.8 in October.

Economists had forecast a score of 51.1. Any reading above 50 indicates
expansion in the sector.

New orders declined in October and output growth eased.

Production rose for the fourth month in a row in October, with the rate
of growth easing for the third straight month.

New export [business][1] rose for the fourth month in a row and at the
fastest since January 2018. Backlogs of works rose for the first time
since July 2018.

The number of workforce expanded in October and the rate of job creation
was the strongest since June 2018.

Purchasing activity expanded further in October and the volume of inputs
orders rose at the fastest rate since June 2019. Suppliers' delivery
time lengthened for the ninth month in a row.

Input cost inflation was the highest in twenty-three months in October
and manufacturers rose their own prices charged at a faster rate.

Firms expect the output to increase over the next 12-months and the
overall strength of sentiment was the weakest since May.

"The headline PMI is unmoved at 50.8 at the start of the final quarter
of 2020, signalling an ongoing recovery in the sector but a clear lack
of momentum," Trevor Balchin, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
