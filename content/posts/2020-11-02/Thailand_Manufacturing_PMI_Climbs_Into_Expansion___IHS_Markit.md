The manufacturing sector in Thailand swung into expansion in October,
the latest survey from IHS Markit showed on Monday with a manufacturing
PMI score of 50.8.

That's up from 49.9 in September and it moves above the boom-or-bust
line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, production and new orders both rose at faster rates, while
there was a return to growth in purchasing activity and input stocks.

Business sentiment remained negative, While input prices rose in
October, marking the first increase for five months, the rate of
inflation was marginal.
