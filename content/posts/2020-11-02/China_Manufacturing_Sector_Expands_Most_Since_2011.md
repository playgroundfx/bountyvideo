China's manufacturing sector expanded at the strongest pace since
January 2011 on robust output and new work, survey results from IHS
Markit showed Monday.

The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.6 in
October, the highest reading since January 2011, from 53.0 in September.
A score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

The official survey, released over the weekend showed that the
manufacturing PMI fell marginally to 51.4 from 51.5 in September. At the
same time, the non-manufacturing PMI climbed to 56.2 from 55.9 a month
ago.

New orders expanded at the strongest pace since November 2010. However,
growth in new export sales softened notably amid a resurgence of the
[coronavirus][1] disease 2019 virus across a number of export
[markets][2].

The substantial increase in overall workloads led manufacturers to ramp
up their output again in October, with the rate of growth among the
sharpest seen over the past decade.

Companies maintained a cautious approach to staff numbers in October
amid reports of efforts to contain costs. As a result, firms raised
their staffing levels only slightly.

Latest data showed a weaker increase in average input costs in October.
Companies partially passed on higher cost burdens to clients by raising
their average selling prices. Nonetheless, the rate of charge inflation
was mild.

Reflective of the strong improvement in overall market conditions,
[business][3] confidence regarding the 12-month outlook for output
improved to its highest since August 2014.

"As the economic indicators for consumption, investment and industrial
output for September were generally better than expected, it is highly
likely that the economic recovery will continue for the next several
months," Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group said.  
  
But there are still many uncertainties outside of China, so [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers
need to be cautious about normalizing postcoronavirus monetary and
fiscal policies, the economist said.

In the near term, supportive fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and resilient foreign demand
for Chinese goods will keep activity in industry and construction
strong, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Sheana Yue, economists at Capital
Economics, said. Meanwhile, easing virus restrictions and improving
labour market conditions should shore up consumer sentiment and
household spending, the economist added.
