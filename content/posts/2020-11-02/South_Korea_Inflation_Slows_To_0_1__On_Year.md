Consumer prices in South Korea were up just 0.1 percent on year in
October, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.

That was well shy of forecasts for an increase of 0.7 percent and down
sharply from 1.0 percent in September.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices tumbled 0.6 percent versus forecasts
suggesting an increase of 0.5 percent following the 0.7 percent gain in
the previous month.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food prices, sank 0.3 percent on year
after climbing 0.6 percent a month earlier.
