UK employment declined sharply in the second quarter amid the
[coronavirus][1] pandemic, data from the Office for National Statistics
showed Tuesday.  
  
In three months to June, employment declined 220,000 from the previous
quarter to 32.92 million.

The employment rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 76.4 percent in the
June quarter.

In July, about 730,000 fewer people were in paid employment when
compared with March 2020, data showed.  
  
The number of people out of work decreased 10,000 sequentially to 1.34
million in three months to June. The unemployment rate was largely
unchanged at 3.9 percent, data showed. Economists had forecast the rate
to rise to 4.2 percent.  
  
In three months to June, total nominal pay fell 1.2 percent on the year
and regular nominal pay dropped 0.2 percent. This was the first negative
pay growth in regular nominal earnings since records began in 2001, the
ONS reported.

In July, claimant count increased by seasonally adjusted 94,400 from the
previous month compared to economists' forecast of 10,000.
