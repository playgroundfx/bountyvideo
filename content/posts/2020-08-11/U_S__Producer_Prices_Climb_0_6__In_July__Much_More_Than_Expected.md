Partly reflecting a notable increase in prices for services, the Labor
Department released a report on Tuesday showing U.S. producer prices
climbed by more than expected in the month of July.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose
by 0.6 percent in July after dipping by 0.2 percent in June.

The rebound in producer prices reflected the largest increase since
October of 2018 and exceeded economist estimates for an uptick of 0.3
percent.

Energy prices showed another substantial increase during the month,
spiking by 5.3 percent in July after soaring by 7.7 percent in June.

Meanwhile, the report said food prices fell by 0.5 percent in July after
plunging by 5.2 percent in the previous month.

Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices still climbed by
0.5 percent in July after falling by 0.3 percent in June. Economists had
expected core prices to inch up by 0.1 percent.

The much bigger than expected increase in core prices came as prices for
final demand services also rose by 0.5 percent in July following a 0.3
percent drop in June.

The Labor Department said about 60 percent of the growth in prices for
services can be traced to a 0.4 percent increase in prices for final
demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing.

Prices for final demand trade services also advanced by 0.8 percent,
while prices for final demand transportation and warehousing services
slumped by 0.8 percent.

Compared to the same month a year ago, producer prices in July were down
by 0.4 percent following a 0.8 percent decrease in June.

The annual rate of growth in core producer prices accelerated to 0.3
percent in July from 0.1 percent in the previous month.

On Wednesday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release a separate
report on consumer prices in the month of July.

Consumer prices are expected to rise by 0.3 percent in July after
climbing by 0.6 percent in June, while core consumer prices are expected
to edge up by 0.2 percent for the second straight month.
