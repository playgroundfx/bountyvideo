Australia's [business][1] conditions improved further in July ahead of
the escalation of stage 4 restrictions in Victoria, while business
confidence weakened from June, survey results from the National
Australia Bank revealed Tuesday.

With the improvement in three sub-components, the business conditions
index advanced to zero in July from -8 in June.

Trading and profitability returned to positive territory and the
employment index continued to improve. The improvement in conditions was
broad-based across states but the monthly outcome was mixed across
industries.

Although conditions made a notable improvement, it may reflect activity
coming off a low base, NAB said.

The survey showed that the business sentiment index declined to -14 from
zero a month ago as confidence logged significant deterioration across
all industries.

While the improvement in conditions is very welcome, capacity
utilization and forward orders point to ongoing weakness overall, Alan
Oster, NAB group chief economist said.

Therefore, with confidence still fragile there is some risk that
conditions lose some of their recent gains in coming months, Oster
added.
