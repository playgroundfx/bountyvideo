South Africa's manufacturing output declined at a softer pace in June as
the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s since late March had an
extensive impact on economic activity, data from Statistics South Africa
showed on Tuesday.

Manufacturing output fell 16.3 percent year-on-year in June, following a
32.4 percent decline in May.

The biggest negative contribution came mainly from basic iron and steel,
non-ferrous metal products, metal products and machinery, food and
beverages motor vehicles, parts and accessories and other transport
equipment, wood and wood products, paper, publishing and printing, and
furniture and 'other' manufacturing.

On a month-on-month basis, manufacturing output grew 16.8 percent in
June but slower than the 30.4 percent rise in the preceding month.

During three months ended in June, manufacturing output fell 30.2
percent, following a 25.4 percent decrease in the preceding period.
