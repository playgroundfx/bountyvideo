Singapore's gross domestic product dropped 13.2 percent on year in the
second quarter of 2020, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in
Tuesday's final report.

That was in line with expectations following the upwardly revised 0.3
percent contraction in the three months prior (originally -0.7 percent).

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP plummeted 42.9 percent
following the upwardly revised 3.1 percent decline in the first quarter
(originally -4.7 percent).

The fall in GDP was due to the Circuit Breaker (CB) measures implemented
from 7 April to 1 June 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore,
as well as weak external demand amidst a global economic downturn caused
by the COVID19 pandemic.

Individually by sector, goods producing industries were down 9.2 percent
on year - including a 0.7 percent fall in manufacturing and a 59.3
percent decline in construction.

The services producing industries sank an annual 13.4 percent, including
drops from wholesale and retail trade, transportation, food services,
communications, finance and [business][1].

On a quarterly basis, goods producing industries tumbled 48.1 percent,
including declines in manufacturing and construction.

The services producing industries dropped 37.4 percent, including falls
in wholesale and retail trade, transportation, food services,
communications, finance and business.

Upon the release of the data, the MTI narrowed Singapore's GDP growth
forecast for 2020 to -7.0 to -5.0 percent from -7.0 to -4.0 percent.

Many of Singapore's key final demand [markets][2] saw worse-than-
projected economic disruptions in the second quarter, and are also
expected to experience a more gradual pace of recovery in the second
half of 2020 due to the threat of localized outbreaks and the continued
need for restriction measures to contain such outbreaks as they occur.

Notwithstanding the narrowing of the forecast range, there continues to
be significant uncertainty over how the COVID-19 situation will evolve
in the coming quarters, and correspondingly, the trajectory of the
economic recovery in both the global and domestic economies.
