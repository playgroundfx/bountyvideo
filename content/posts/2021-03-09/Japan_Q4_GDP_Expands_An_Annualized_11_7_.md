Japan's gross domestic product climbed an annualized 11.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.

That missed expectations for an increase of 12.8 percent following the
22.9 percent surge in the three months prior.

On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product gained 2.8 percent - again
missing forecasts for 3.0 percent and down from 5.3 percent in the
previous three months.

Capital expenditure was up 4.3 percent on quarter, beating forecasts for
a gain of 4.1 percent following the 2.4 percent contraction in Q3.

External demand was up 1.1 percent on quarter in Q4, slowing from 2.6
percent in the third quarter - while the price index added 0.3 percent
on year after rising 1.2 percent in the previous three months.

Private consumption was up 2.2 percent on quarter, slowing from 5.1
percent in the third quarter.

Also on Tuesday, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
said that the average of household spending in Japan was down 6.1
percent on year in January, coming in at 267,760 yen.

That missed expectations for a decline of 2.1 percent on year following
the 0.6 percent contraction in December.

The average of monthly income per household stood at 469,254 yen, down
2.5 percent on year.

Individually, spending was down for food, housing, clothing, medical
care, transportation and recreation. It was higher for fuel, furniture
and education.

On a monthly basis, household spending was down 7.3 percent.
