The global [economy][1] is set to grow at a faster pace this year than
projected earlier due to an accelerated roll-out of vaccinations against
the coronavirus and a better outlook for the U.S. on the back of a huge
stimulus boost, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development said Tuesday.  
  
The Paris-based think tank raised the global GDP growth forecast for
this year to 5.6 percent from 4.2 percent seen in December in its latest
Interim Economic Outlook report.  
  
The global economy is projected to expand 4.0 percent in 2022, which is
faster than the 3.7 percent forecast in December.  
  
"Despite the improved global outlook, output and incomes in many
countries will remain below the level expected prior to the pandemic at
the end of 2022," the OECD warned.  
  
World output is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by mid-2021, but
the pace and duration of the recovery will depend on the race between
vaccines and emerging variants of the virus, the OECD said.

"Speed is of the essence," OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr√≠a said.  
  
"If we don't get enough people vaccinated quickly enough to allow
restrictions to be lifted, the recovery will be slower and we will
undermine the benefits of fiscal stimulus," OECD Chief Economist
Laurence Boone said.

The OECD raised the US growth projection to 6.5 percent from 3.2 percent
seen in December. The upward revision partly reflects the large fiscal
stimulus planned with a sustained pace of vaccination, the group said.
The US growth projection for next year was raised to 4.0 percent.  
  
Eurozone growth forecast for this year was also upgraded to 3.9 percent
from 3.6 percent. The vaccination is slower and stimulus is lower in the
single currency bloc, the think tank noted.  
  
Among the big four, projections were lowered for France and Italy.  
  
China's GDP growth projection for this year was lowered to 7.8 percent
from 8.0 percent.  
  
The biggest upgrade of the growth projection for this year was for
India. The country's growth outlook was boosted to 12.6 percent, the
fastest among OECD members, from 7.9 percent.  
  
Regarding the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), OECD said the current very accommodative
stance should be maintained. Policymakers should allow temporary
overshooting of headline inflation provided underlying price pressures
remain well contained, with macroprudential policies deployed where
necessary to ensure financial stability, the group added.
