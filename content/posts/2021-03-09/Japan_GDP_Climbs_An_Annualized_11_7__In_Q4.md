Japan's gross domestic product was up an annualized 11.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.

That was shy of expectations for an increase of 12.8 percent following
the 22.9 percent surge in the three months prior.

On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product gained 2.8 percent - again
missing forecasts for 3.0 percent and down from 5.3 percent in the
previous three months.

Capital expenditure was up 4.3 percent on quarter, beating forecasts for
a gain of 4.1 percent following the 2.4 percent contraction in Q3.
