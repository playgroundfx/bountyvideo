percent on year in January. Producer prices are tipped to advance 1.5
percent on year after gaining 0.3 percent in the previous month.

Australia will see March results for the consumer confidence index from

predicted to plummet 19.4 percent on month after rising 12.0 percent in
December.

New Zealand will provide February figures for electronic retail card
spending; in January, card spending was down 0.4 percent on month and up
