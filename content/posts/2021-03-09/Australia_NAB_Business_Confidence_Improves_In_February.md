Australia's [business][1] confidence and conditions improved in
February, survey results from the National Australia Bank showed
Tuesday.

The business confidence index advanced to 16 from 12 in January. This
was the highest reading since early 2010.  
  
The gain in confidence was broadly based, with all states and industries
recording an increase - except retail.

With trading, profitability and employment conditions marking solid
improvements, the business conditions index bounced to return to 15
points from 9 a month ago. A similar score was last seen in December and
was the highest since August 2018.

Conditions remained very strong in retail, wholesale, mining and
professional services, while construction, personal services and
transport conditions continue to lag.

The survey continues to point to a robust recovery in the business
sector, despite some tapering of government support beginning in late
2020, the NAB said. This is a positive sign for the [economy][2], where
ongoing strength in the business and household sector is needed to
sustain the recovery.
