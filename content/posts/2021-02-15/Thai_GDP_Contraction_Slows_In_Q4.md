Thailand's [economy][1] contracted at a slower pace in the fourth
quarter underpinned by household and government spending, the National
Economic and Social Development Council said Monday.

Nonetheless, the [coronavirus][2] pandemic pushed the economy into its
worst recession since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998.

Gross domestic product fell 4.2 percent year-on-year in the fourth
quarter, slower than the 6.4 percent decline in the previous quarter and
the economists' forecast of -5.4 percent.

On a quarterly basis, GDP grew 1.3 percent but weaker than the 6.2
percent growth logged in the third quarter. Economists had forecast an
expansion of 0.8 percent.

In 2020, the economy contracted 6.1 percent, reversing an expansion of
2.3 percent in 2019. This was the biggest fall since 1998, when GDP fell
7.6 percent.

The NESDC forecast the economy to grow 2.5-3.5 percent this year
underpinned by global recovery, fiscal stimulus and the rebound in
domestic private demand.

The expenditure-side breakdown showed that private consumption
expenditures climbed 0.9 percent, reversing a 0.6 percent fall in the
third quarter.

At the same time, government expenditure advanced 1.9 percent albeit
slower than the 2.5 percent increase seen in the prior quarter.

Total investment decreased by 2.5 percent, continued from a reduction of
2.6 percent in the previous quarter.

Exports decreased 21.4 percent and imports were down 7 percent in the
fourth quarter.

After falling 0.4 percent in 2019, headline inflation is seen in the
range of 1-2 percent.
