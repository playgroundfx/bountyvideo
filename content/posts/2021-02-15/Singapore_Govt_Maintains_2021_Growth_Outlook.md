Singapore's growth outlook for this year was maintained as the
government expects a gradual recovery underpinned by the pickup in
foreign demand.

In 2021, the city-state [economy][1] is projected to grow 4 percent to 6
percent, which was unchanged from the previous forecast, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry said Monday.

The economy had contracted 5.4 percent in 2020, in contrast to the 1.3
percent growth logged in 2019.

Gross domestic product shrank 2.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth
quarter, slower than the 3.8 percent decline initially estimated and
also smaller than the 5.8 percent decline posted in the third quarter.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy expanded 3.8 percent, after
rising 9.0 percent growth recorded in the previous quarter. The fourth
quarter growth was revised up from 2.1 percent.

According to MTI, outward-oriented sectors are forecast to benefit from
the pickup in external demand this year. Meanwhile, the tourism and
aviation-related sectors are projected to see a weaker recovery than
previously expected due to the slow pace of lifting travel restrictions.

Consumer-facing sectors, namely retail trade and food and beverage
services are expected to benefit from an improvement in consumer
sentiments, the government noted.

Although the construction and marine and offshore engineering sectors
are projected to recover from the low base last year, activity levels at
construction worksites and shipyards will continue to be dampened by the
requirement for safe management measures.
