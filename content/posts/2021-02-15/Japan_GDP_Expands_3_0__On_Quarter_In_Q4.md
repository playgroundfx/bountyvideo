Japan's gross domestic product gained 3.0 percent on quarter in the
fourth quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office said in Monday's preliminary
report.

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 2.3 percent following the
5.3 percent gain in the previous three months.

On an annualized basis, GDP spiked 12.7 percent - again beating
forecasts for a gain of 9.5 percent following the 22.9 percent surge in
the three months prior.

For all of 2020, GDP was down 4.8 percent after adding 0.3 percent in
2019 and 0.6 percent in 2018.
