The Reserve Bank of Australia will on Tuesday release the minutes from
its Feb. 2 monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, highlighting a light day for Asia-
Pacific economic activity.

At the meeting, the RBA decided to maintain the targets of 10 basis
points for the cash rate and the yield on the 3-year Australian
Government bond, as well as the parameters of the Term Funding Facility.

The board also decided to buy an additional A$100 billion of bonds
issued by the Australian Government and states and territories when the
current bond purchase program is completed in mid-April. These
additional purchases will be at the current rate of A$5 billion a week.

Japan will see December results for its tertiary industry index; in
November, the index was up 0.7 percent on month.

Finally, the [markets][1] in Taiwan and China remain closed for the
