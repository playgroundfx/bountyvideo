The euro area trade surplus increased to a record high in December
driven by higher exports, data from Eurostat showed on Monday.

The trade surplus increased to a seasonally adjusted EUR 27.5 billion
from EUR 24.9 billion in November. This was the largest surplus recorded
over the period for which data are available, Eurostat said.

Exports grew 1.1 percent on month, while imports decreased 0.3 percent
from November.

On a yearly basis, exports increased for the first time since February
2020. Exports climbed 2.3 percent, while imports fell 1.3 percent.

As a result, the trade surplus increased to EUR 29.2 billion from EUR
22.6 billion in the same period last year.
