Japan's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 3.0

That exceeded expectations for an increase of 2.3 percent following the
5.3 percent gain in the previous three months.

On an annualized basis, GDP spiked 12.7 percent - again beating
forecasts for a gain of 9.5 percent following the 22.9 percent surge in
the three months prior.

Capital expenditure climbed 4.5 percent on quarter, beating forecasts
for 2.6 percent following the 2.4 percent decline in Q3.

External demand gained 1.0 percent on quarter, in line with expectations
and down from 2.7 percent in the third quarter.

The GDP price index rose 0.2 percent on year after gaining 1.2 percent
in the three months prior.

Private consumption was up 2.2 percent on quarter, beating forecasts for
1.8 percent and down from 5.1 percent in the previous three months.

Domestic demand was up 8.1 percent on quarter, including an 8.4 increase
in private demand and a 7.3 percent gain in public demand. On a yearly
basis, domestic demand sank 1.2 percent, including a 2.4 percent drop in
private demand and a 1.2 percent gain in public demand.

Nominal GDP was up 2.5 percent on quarter and 10.5 percent on year.

For all of 2020, GDP was down 4.8 percent after adding 0.3 percent in
2019 and 0.6 percent in 2018. Nominal GDP was down 3.9 percent last
year.
