Estonia's jobless rate declined in the fourth quarter, after rising
sharply in the previous three months, data from Statistics Estonia
showed on Monday.

The jobless rate fell to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 7.7
percent in the third quarter. In the second quarter, the rate was 5
percent.

A year ago, the rate was 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter.

In 2020, the unemployment rate climbed to 6.8 percent from 4.4 percent
in 2019, largely due to the disruption to economic activity caused by
the [coronavirus][1] pandemic. The rate was the highest since 2016, when
it was at the same level.

The number of unemployed were 47,900 persons, which was 16,600 more than
in 2019.

"Compared to 2019, the share of unemployed persons grew the most among
clerical support workers, technicians and associate professionals,"
Katriin Polluaar, analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.

The number of employed persons increased by 16,600 to 47,900 in 2020.
The employment rate was 66.7 percent.

The labor force participation rate remained unchanged at 71.6 percent in
2020.
