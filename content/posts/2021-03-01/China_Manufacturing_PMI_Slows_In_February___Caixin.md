The manufacturing sector in China continued to expand in February,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Caixin showed on Monday
with a manufacturing PMI score of 50.9.

That's down from 51.5 in January, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output expanded modestly amid a softer rise in new work as
the pandemic weighed on export sales and supplier performance.

Greater prices for raw materials and higher transport costs led to a
further substantial rise in input costs. As a result, prices charged by
manufacturers rose solidly as companies looked to partially pass on
higher cost burdens to customers.

Business confidence improved on hopes for a global economic recovery in
the months ahead.
