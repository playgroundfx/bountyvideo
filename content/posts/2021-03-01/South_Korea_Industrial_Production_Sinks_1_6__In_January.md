Industrial production was down a seasonally adjusted 1.6 percent on
month in January, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.

That missed forecasts for an increase of 1.0 percent following the
downwardly revised 2.7 percent increase in December (originally 3.7
percent).

On a yearly basis, industrial production jumped 7.5 percent - beating
expectations for an increase of 5.3 percent following the downwardly
revised 2.5 percent gain in the previous month (originally 3.4 percent).

The index of all industry production was down 0.6 percent on month in
January and up 1.4 percent on year.
