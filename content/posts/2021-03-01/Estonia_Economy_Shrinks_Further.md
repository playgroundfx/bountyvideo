Estonia's [economy][1] contracted for a fourth straight quarter in the
final three months of 2020, a year in which economic activity was
severely hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.

Gross domestic product dropped an unadjusted 1.2 percent year-on-year
after a 2.5 percent slump in the third quarter, preliminary data from
Statistics Estonia showed Monday.

The economy has been shrinking since the first quarter of 2020 as the
[coronavirus][2] started spreading across the world. In the fourth
quarter of 2019, the economy had expanded 5.3 percent.

Household consumption decreased by 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter.
While expenditure on furnishings, food and communication continued to
increase, spending on transport, clothing and leisure decreased.

On a seasonally and working-day adjusted basis, GDP decreased 1.9
percent year-on-year after a 3.5 percent fall in the third quarter.

Despite the travel restrictions due to the pandemic, exports fared well
with sharp increase in demand for electronic equipment and chemical
products. Imports were led by those of machinery and equipment.

Investments into the financial sector and into transport equipment fell.
Receipts of both value-added tax and excise duties decreased, due to
base effect.

Compared to the previous three months, GDP grew an unadjusted 7.3
percent in the fourth quarter after a 7.1 percent increase in the third
quarter.

Seasonally and working-day adjusted GDP rose 2.1 percent sequentially
following a 2.5 percent growth in the previous quarter.

The economy grew sequentially for a second straight quarter.

"The contribution of manufacturing was negative, but the situation in
that economic activity improved to reach pre-pandemic levels," Robert
Muursepp, an analyst at Statistics Estonia, said.

The rapid decline in transportation and storage also slowed down, the
economist noted. That said, there were other signs of the economy
recovering at the end of the year, Muursepp said, pointing to the
positive contribution from the information and communication and the
financial sector.

In the full year 2020, the Estonian economy shrank 2.9 percent due to
the restrictions imposed in response to the coronavirus, after a 5.0
percent expansion in 2019.

This was the first annual decline in output since a 14.4 percent slump
since the global financial crisis of 2009.
