The Czech Republic's manufacturing sector growth eased to the lowest in
three months in February, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The headline manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to
56.5 in February from 57.0 in January. Economists had forecast a score
of 58.1.

Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.

Output and new orders increased further in February. The rate of growth
in new export orders was the slowest for five months due to
[coronavirus][1] restrictions.

Suppliers' delivery time lengthened in February.

Input prices rose at the sharpest pace since March 2011 and selling
prices rose modestly. The rate of charge inflation was the quickest
since may 2019.

Employment rose for the fifth straight month in February and backlogs of
work rose solidly.

Optimism was attributed to greater client demand, with the hopes of a
successful vaccine roll-out and end of restrictions.

"We do not currently foresee any interest changes until late-2021, with
the latest inflationary risks expected to be transitory," Sian Jones,
economist at IHS Markit, said.
