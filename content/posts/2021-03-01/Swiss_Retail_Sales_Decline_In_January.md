Switzerland's retail sales declined in January, preliminary data from
the Federal Statistical Office showed on Monday.

Retail sales adjusted for sales days and holidays fell by 0.5 percent
year-on-year in January.

Sales of food, beverages and tobacco grew 13.9 percent yearly in
January, while those of non-food sector decreased 10.1 percent.

Sales of other goods declined 18.9 percent and those of culture and
recreation goods in specialized stores fell 15.1 percent. Sales of other
household equipment, textiles, DIY and furniture decreased 7.4 percent.

On a monthly basis, seasonally adjusted retail sales fell 5.3 percent in
January.

In nominal [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), retail sales declined 0.9 percent annually in January
and decreased 4.9 percent from a month ago.

The latest decline was mainly due to the measures introduced by the
authorities to contain the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the
agency said.
