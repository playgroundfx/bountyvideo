The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to expand in February,
albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from Markit Economics showed
on Monday with a manufacturing PMI score of 50.9.

That's down from 52.2 in January, although it remains above the boom-or-
bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, output growth fell to a four-month low while inflationary
pressures were at their strongest since late 2018.

Input costs increased substantially, with the rate of inflation
quickening to the sharpest since October 2018. Higher costs for raw
materials were widely mentioned amid supply shortages and difficulties
sourcing inputs from abroad.

Employment neared stabilization.
