Greece's manufacturing activity contracted in February, survey results
from IHS Markit showed on Monday.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index decreased to 49.4 in
February from 50.0 in January. A reading below 50.0 indicates
contraction in the sector.

Output and new orders deteriorated in February. New export orders
declined further and the rate of contraction was the slowest since
September last year.

The rate of cost inflation rose for the seventh straight month in
February to the sharpest since October 2000. The rate of charge
inflation was the fastest since July 2008.

Backlogs of work increased at a sharp pace in February and the number of
workforce increased fractionally.

The 12-month outlook remained optimistic with hopes of successful
vaccine roll-out.

"Our current forecast expects industrial production to increase 2.1
percent in 2021," Sian Jones, economist at IHS Markit, said.
