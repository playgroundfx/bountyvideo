Russia's manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in nearly two years
in February, underpinned by robust output and new order growth.

The Russia Manufacturing PMI rose to 51.5 in February from 50.9 in
January, survey data from IHS Markit showed Monday. A reading above 50
suggest growth in the sector. The overall upturn was the sharpest since
April 2019, the research group said.

The pace of decline in export [business][1] slowed, but orders remained
robust. Employment grew the most in over two years.

Business confidence was the highest in over a year, thus back to levels
last seen before the [coronavirus][2] disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Vendor performance deteriorated at the fastest pace since May 2020 as
lead time for inputs were longer largely due to transportation delays
and supplier shortages.

Input price inflation was among the steepest since February 2015 and the
pace of output price inflation accelerated to the sharpest in six years
as firms raised prices sharply in a bid to pass on the burden of higher
costs.

"Our current forecast expects industrial production to rise 4.1 percent
in 2021, as the sector seeks to recover from the downturn seen in 2020,"
IHS Markit economist Sian Jones said.
