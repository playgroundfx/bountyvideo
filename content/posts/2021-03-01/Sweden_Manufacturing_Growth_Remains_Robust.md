Sweden's manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in February, but
the pace of expansion remained robust.

The manufacturing purchasing manager's index, or PMI, fell to 61.6 from
62.5 in January, survey data from Swedbank and the logistics association
SILF showed Monday.

A reading above 50 suggests growth in the sector. The score remained
well above its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) average of 54.5.

"Swedish manufacturing industry continues to show a high level of
activity even though longer delivery times may be  
signs of supply constraints or disruptions in foreign trade that may in
the long run limit growth in the industry," Swedbank analyst Jorgen
Kennemar said.

New order growth was the lowest in six months in February. Production
gains also slowed.
