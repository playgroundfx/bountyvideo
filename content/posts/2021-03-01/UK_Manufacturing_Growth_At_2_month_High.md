UK manufacturing expansion strengthened marginally in February as
stretched supply chains and rising costs weighed on growth.

The seasonally adjusted CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to
55.1 in February from 54.1 in January, survey data from IHS Markit
showed Monday. That was above the flash estimate of 54.9.

A reading above 50 suggests growth in the sector and the PMI has
signaled growth for nine months in a row.

Output growth was the slowest in the current nine-month sequence of
increase. New orders grew marginally after a slight decrease in January,
due to improvement in domestic demand and export [business][1].
Employment rose at the quickest pace since June 2018.

Supply chain disruptions and raw material shortages pushed input cost
inflation to its highest rate for over four years. Subsequently, output
prices rose at the fastest pace since January 2018.

Business optimism rose to a 77-month high in February, with over 63
percent of companies reporting that they expect output to be higher in
one year's time, the survey said.

Continued recovery from the pandemic, reopening of the global
[economy][2] including less transport restriction, and reduced Brexit
uncertainties boosted confidence.

Survey data were collected during February 11-23.

"With current constraints likely to continue for the foreseeable future,
pressure on prices and output volumes may remain a feature during the
coming months," IHS Markit Director Rob Dobson said.

"That said, improved domestic demand as lockdown restrictions ease and a
further rise in manufacturers' optimism are reasons to hope brighter
times are on the horizon, and have already supported a modest rebound in
staffing levels since the turn of the year."
