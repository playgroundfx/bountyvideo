French consumer price inflation rose slightly in June driven by the
rebound in manufactured goods prices, the provisional estimate from the
statistical office Insee showed on Wednesday.

Consumer price inflation rose to 1.5 percent in June from 1.4 percent in
May. The rate was expected to remain unchanged at 1.5 percent.  
  
Meanwhile, the harmonized inflation rose marginally to 1.9 percent, in
line with expectations, from 1.8 percent in the previous month. Final
data is due on July 13.

Manufactured product prices advanced 0.9 percent, reversing a 0.1
percent drop in May. Food prices were down 0.3 percent, as seen in May.
Energy price inflation slowed to 10.9 percent and services cost grew at
a slower pace of 0.9 percent.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices gained 0.2 percent versus a 0.3
percent rise in May. At the same time, the harmonized index of consumer
prices moved up 0.2 percent versus 0.3 percent in the previous month.  
  
Another report from the statistical office Insee revealed that producer
prices in domestic market grew at a faster pace of 6.6 percent annually
in May after climbing 6 percent in the previous month, as a consequence
of the low prices observed in the spring of 2020 in connection with the
[health][1] crisis.

On month, producer prices gained 0.5 percent, reversing a 0.8 percent
drop in April.
