The euro area inflation fell below 2 percent in June as the annual
growth in energy prices eased, preliminary data from Eurostat showed on
Wednesday.

Inflation came in at 1.9 percent in June, as expected, down from 2
percent in the previous month.

The inflation rate had exceeded the European Central Bank's target of
"below, but close to" 2 percent in May for the first time since 2018.

Most of the evidence points to this slowdown as temporary, but upside
risks to the inflation outlook have not been this substantial in years
and should keep the ECB on the edge of its seat, Bert Colijn, an ING
economist, said.

Looking ahead, energy price inflation is likely to stay around its
current level until the end of the year and then drop back, Andrew
Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

The headline inflation is likely to rise over 2.5 percent by the end of
the year, but then it will fall back to only around 1 percent in 2022
and remain low over the medium term, the economist added.

Core inflation that excludes energy food, alcohol and tobacco, eased to
0.9 percent from 1 percent in the previous month.

Among components, energy prices advanced 12.5 percent, but slower than
the 13.1 percent increase posted in the previous month. Services cost
grew at a slower pace of 0.7 percent.

Food, alcohol and tobacco prices gained 0.6 percent and non-energy
industrial goods prices grew 1.2 percent.

Among big-four economies of the euro area, Germany's harmonized
inflation weakened to 2.1 percent from 2.4 percent in May. At the same
time, Spain's inflation held steady at 2.4 percent in June.

By contrast, France's inflation rose marginally to 1.9 percent in June
from 1.8 percent in the previous month. Likewise, Italy's consumer price
growth rose to 1.3 percent from 1.2 percent.
