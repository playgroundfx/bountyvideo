Hungary's producer price inflation increased in May, figures from the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office showed on Wednesday.

The producer price index rose 11.3 percent year-on-year in May,
following a 9.8 percent increase April.

against the euro and by the price rise of raw and base materials, the
agency said.

Domestic market producer prices gained 14.4 percent in May and foreign
market prices increased by 9.6 percent.

On a monthly basis, producer prices fell 0.1 percent in May.

Separate data from the statistical office showed that the average gross
wages increased 10.3 percent yearly in April, following a 9.2 percent
rise in March.

On an annual basis, net gross wages rose 10.3 percent in April,
following a 9.2 percent increase in the prior month.
