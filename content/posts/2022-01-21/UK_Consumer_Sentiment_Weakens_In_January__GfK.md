UK consumer confidence weakened in January amid concerns over higher
inflation and interest rate hikes, survey results from GfK showed on
Friday.

The consumer confidence index fell to -19 in January from -15 in the
previous month. All five measures of the index were down in comparison
to the December 17th data.

The index measuring the past personal financial situation dropped
slightly to -6 in January from -5. The outlook for personal financial
situation declined 3 points to -2.

The assessment of general economic situation logged a marked decline.
The gauge for the past general economic situation slid to -47 in January
from -39 in the prior month. At the same time, the outlook for general
economic conditions worsened to -32 from -24.

The major purchase index came in at -10 versus -6 in the previous month.

"Will the mood brighten when the latest wave of the pandemic subsides
and Covid numbers improve? It seems unlikely because it's the cost-of-
living squeeze that's worrying us now and this will affect us for months
to come," Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK said.
