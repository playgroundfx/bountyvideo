Eurozone's consumer confidence weakened for a fourth month in a row in
January, but the decline was less than expected, preliminary data from
the European Commission showed Friday.  
  
The flash consumer confidence index eased to -8.5 from -8.4 in December,
revised from -8.3. Economists had forecast a fall to -9.0.  
  
The latest reading remained the worst since March, when the score was
-10.8.  
The corresponding indicator for the EU dropped to -10.0 from -9.6 in the
previous month.  
  
The indicators for both regions are now well below its pre-pandemic
level and approaching its long-term average in both areas, the
commission said.

The survey data was collected from January 1 to 20.

The final figures are set to be released along with the monthly economic
sentiment survey data on January 28.
