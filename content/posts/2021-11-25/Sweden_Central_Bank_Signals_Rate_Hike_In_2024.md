Sweden's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged, as widely
expected on Thursday, and signaled a rate hike in 2024.

At the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, the Executive Board of Riksbank decided
to hold the repo rate at zero percent. The bank forecast a rate hike in
the latter part of 2024.

The board also decided to purchase bonds during the first quarter of
2022 to compensate for forthcoming principal payments in the Riksbank's
asset holdings.

The bank forecast the holdings to remain roughly unchanged in 2022,
after which they will gradually decrease.

But the message that the balance sheet will "decrease gradually"
thereafter suggests that the Bank is eyeing "QT" in 2023, David Oxley,
an economist at Capital Economics, said.

"On balance, we think the risks are that it shrinks the balance sheet
faster than it has in mind," the economist added.

Riksbank has upgraded its inflation forecasts for this year, 2022 and
2023. Inflation was 3.1 percent in October 2021. The central bank
forecasts it to fall next year.

Inflation is seen at 2.1 percent in 2021 instead of 2 percent estimated
earlier. Likewise, the outlook for 2022 was lifted to 2.3 percent from
2.1 percent.

The bank forecast inflation to slow to 1.9 percent in 2023 versus prior
forecast of 1.8 percent.  
  
According to the latest estimate, the [economy][1] will grow 4.7 percent
this year, unchanged from the previous outlook. The projection for next
year was lifted to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent.

In 2024, economic growth is seen at 1.5 percent and inflation at 2.2
percent.
