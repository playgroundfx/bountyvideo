Staff projections in December may not resolve all uncertainties around
the medium-term outlook and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers must keep sufficient [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
for future monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions, the minutes of the latest European
Central Bank meeting showed Thursday.  
  
"While the Governing Council would benefit from new staff macroeconomic
projections at its December meeting, it was cautioned that the data
available in December would not resolve all the uncertainties around the
medium-term inflation outlook," the ECB said in the minutes, which it
called "account" of the October 27-28 [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session.

"It was seen as important that the Governing Council should keep
sufficient optionality to allow for future monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions,
including beyond its December meeting."

In December, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers were likely to stick to the view that net
asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme or PEPP,
could expected to come to an end by March 2022.

While [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers expressed confidence that the effects of higher
energy prices and of supply bottlenecks would be temporary, the decline
in inflation in 2022 would now take longer than previously expected, the
minutes showed.  
  
They expect the shorter-term inflation outlook for the euro area to once
again be revised upwards in the December 2021 Eurosystem staff
projections.  
  
An argument was also put forward that price effects could be greater
than currently estimated if labor force participation did not return to
pre-crisis levels, the minutes showed.
