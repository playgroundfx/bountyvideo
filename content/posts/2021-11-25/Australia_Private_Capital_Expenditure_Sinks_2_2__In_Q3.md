Private capital expenditure in Australia was down a seasonally adjusted
2.2 percent on quarter in the third quarter of 2021, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday - coming in at A$32.699 billion.

That missed expectations for a fall of 2.0 percent following the 4.4
percent increase in the previous three months.

Building capex was down 0.2 percent on quarter at A$16.922 billion after
rising 4.6 percent in Q2, while plant machinery capex dropped 4.1
percent to A$15.777 billion after gaining 4.3 percent in the three
months prior.

On a yearly basis, overall capital spending was up 12.9 percent, while
building capex rose 9.0 percent and plant machinery capex jumped 17.4
percent.
