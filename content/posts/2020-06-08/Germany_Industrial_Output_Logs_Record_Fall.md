Germany's industrial production logged its biggest decline since the
series began in 1991 as [coronavirus][1] containment measures weighed
heavily on industrial activity, data from Destatis showed Monday.

Industrial output decreased 25.3 percent year-on-year in April,
following an 11.3 percent fall in the previous month. This was the
biggest fall on record.

Month-on-month, industrial production plunged 17.9 percent versus a
revised 8.9 percent drop in March. Economists had forecast a monthly
fall of 16 percent.

The [economy][2] ministry said with the gradual loosening of protective
measures and the resumption of production in the automotive industry,
the economic recovery is beginning.

While the data should improve from May onwards, output probably won't
get back pre-coronavirus levels for at least two years, Andrew
Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Looking ahead, the lifting of the lockdown measures should lead to a
strong rebound in economic activity and also industrial production in
May and June, Carsten Brzeski, an ING economist said. However, at least
for German industry, the period after the imminent rebound does not look
too promising.

Excluding energy and construction, industrial production was down 22.1
percent in April.

Within industry, the production of intermediate goods decreased 13.8
percent and that of consumer goods by 8.7 percent. Capital goods output
was down 35.3 percent.

Automotive industry reported a sharp decline of 74.6 percent in
production.

Energy production was down by 7.2 percent in April and construction
output decreased 4.1 percent.

Data released last week showed that manufacturing orders declined at a
record pace in April. New orders in manufacturing fell 25.8 percent from
March, when they declined 15 percent.
