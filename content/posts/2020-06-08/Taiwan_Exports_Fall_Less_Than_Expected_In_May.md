Taiwan's exports declined less than expected in May, data from the
Ministry of Finance showed Monday.

Exports fell 2 percent year-on-year after easing 1.3 percent in April.
Economists had forecast an annual fall of 4.7 percent.

At the same time, imports decreased 3.5 percent annually, in contrast to
an increase of 0.5 percent in the previous month. Imports were expected
to drop at a slower pace of 2.1 percent.

As a result, the trade balance showed a surplus of $4.7 billion in May.
This was above the expected level of $3.14 billion.
