the downwardly revised 2.9 percent gain in April (originally 3.0
percent).

Excluding trusts, bank lending jumped an annual 5.1 percent to 491.468
trillion yen - up from the 3.1 percent yearly gain in the previous
month.

Lending from trusts gained 2.7 percent on year 70 71.077 trillion yen -
up from the 1.6 percent gain a month earlier. Lending from foreign banks
advanced 12.2 percent to 3.301 trillion yen, slowing from the 25.6
percent spike in April.
