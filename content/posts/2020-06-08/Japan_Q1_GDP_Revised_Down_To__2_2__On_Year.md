Japan's gross domestic product was revised down to 2.2 percent on year
in the first quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office said in Monday's final
reading - placing the country firmly in recession.

Analysts had expected GDP to revised up to -2.1 percent following last
month's preliminary reading that had suggested a yearly drop of 3.4
percent.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP was revised to -0.6
percent - missing forecasts for -0.5 percent following the preliminary
reading of 0.9 percent.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, GDP was down 1.9 percent on quarter and
an upwardly revised 7.2 percent on year (originally -7.3 percent).
