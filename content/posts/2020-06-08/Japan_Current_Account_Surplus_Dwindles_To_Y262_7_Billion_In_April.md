Japan had a current account surplus of 262.7 billion yen in April, the

That missed expectations for a surplus of 480 billion yen following the
1,917.0 billion yen surplus in March.

The trade balance reflected a deficit of 966.5 billion yen following the
103.1 billion yen surplus in the previous month.

Exports were down 23.0 percent on year at 4,909.0 trillion yen, while
imports sank an annual 9.5 percent to 5,875.6 trillion yen.

The capital account showed a deficit of 11.4 billion yen, while the
financial account saw a shortfall of 949.0 billion yen.
