The Reserve Bank of India maintained status quo as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers await
inflationary pressures to ease ahead of loosening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) further to
underpin the [economy][1] that is severely hit by the coronavirus
pandemic.

The newly constituted Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor
Shaktikanta Das, voted unanimously to maintain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) repo rate at
4.00 percent, as widely expected.  
  
The Marginal Standing Facility or MSF rate, and the Bank rate remained
unchanged at 4.25 percent. The reverse repo rate was retained at 3.35
percent.

The last change in the benchmark rate was a 40 basis point cut in May,
taking the cumulative reduction to 250 basis points since February 2019.

The MPC will continue with the accommodative stance of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
as long as necessary, at least during the current financial year and
into the next year, the RBI chief said.

The bank said it will wait to see the easing of inflationary pressures
to use the space available for supporting growth further.

The committee observed that the accommodative stance is needed to revive
growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 on the
economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.

The relatively dovish tone of the statement, along with the dire growth
outlook, the easing cycle will resume before long, Shilan Shah, an
economist at Capital Economics, said.

Real GDP growth was expected to be negative at -9.5 percent for the
current financial year ending March 2021, with risks tilted to the
downside. Economic growth for the first quarter of 2021-22 was placed at
20.6 percent.

CPI inflation was projected at 6.8 percent for the second quarter of
2020-21. The RBI aims to achieve inflation of 4 percent within a band of
+/- 2 percent.

For 2021-22, assuming a normalization of supply chains with the
availability of effective vaccines against Covid-19, inflation is set to
move in a range of 4.1-4.4 percent and real GDP to grow 10.1 percent,
the bank said in its Monetary Policy Report.

The governor said the bank stands ready to undertake more measures as
required to ensure liquidity and easy financing conditions.

The RBI unveiled a range of measures to improve liquidity. The bank
decided to conduct on tap TLTRO for a total amount of INR 1 trillion for
banks to invest in corporate bonds and debt instruments of specific
sectors.

The bank will also conduct open market operations in State Development
Loans as a special case during the current financial year.

The latest MPC meeting was originally scheduled to be conducted on
October 1, but was postponed after the government failed to appoint
three governors to the board.
