France's industrial production slowed more than expected in August, led
by manufacturing, preliminary data from the statistical office INSEE
showed on Friday.

Total industrial output grew 1.3 percent from July, when it increased
3.8 percent. Economists were looking for a 1.7 percent gain.

Manufacturing output rose 1 percent monthly in August, which was much
slower than the 4.5 percent growth in July.

Industrial output was 6.3 percent lower compared to February, which was
the last month before the beginning of the general lockdown to battle
the [coronavirus][1], or Covid-19, pandemic, INSEE said.

Factory output was 7.4 percent lower from February.

In August, output grew in other manufacturing, manufacture of transport
equipment, mining and quarrying and utilities, but at slower rates.

Meanwhile, manufacture of machinery and equipment goods and food and
beverages decreased after growing in the previous month. Manufacture of
coke and refined petroleum continued to fall at sharp rates.

Construction output grew 4.9 percent from July, when it rose 4 percent.
