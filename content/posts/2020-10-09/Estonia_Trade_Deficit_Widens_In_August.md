Estonia's trade deficit widened in August as imports and exports
declined, figures from Statistics Estonia showed on Friday.

The trade deficit rose to EUR 113 million in August from EUR 98 million
in the same month last year. In July, the trade deficit was EUR 124
million.

Exports fell 6.0 year-on-year in August, following a 1.0 percent decline
in July.

Imports decreased 4.0 percent yearly in August, following a 6.0 percent
fall in the previous month.

The decline in both exports and imports were largely due to a fall in
trade with EU countries.

"Estonia's exports depend to a great extent on the economic situation in
neighboring countries Finland, Sweden and Latvia," leading analyst at
Statistics Estonia Evelin Puura said.

"In August, the share of these three main partner countries accounted
for a third of the exports of goods; the share of European Union
countries was 67 percent," Puura added.
