China's service sector registered a strong growth in [business][1]
activity in September, signaling a further recovery from the coronavirus
pandemic, survey data from IHS Markit showed Friday.

The Caixin composite services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.8 in
September from 54.0 in August. This was the fifth consecutive increase
in service sector output.

The expansion was underpinned by a sustained rise in total new business.
Stronger domestic demand was the principal factor that supported new
work as export orders contracted again.

Firms raised their workforce numbers for the second month in a row.

On the price front, the survey showed that the rate of input price
inflation slid to a three-month low. Firms that reported higher costs
attributed this to increased expenses related to transport, staff and
raw materials.

Prices charged by services companies advanced for the second month in
September, with some firms mentioning raising their selling prices in
order to protect their margins.  
  
Business confidence regarding activity levels over the next 12 months
remained strongly positive in September as companies anticipate activity
to rise with the recovery in global economic conditions.

As a softer rise in manufacturing production more than offset a faster
expansion of services activity, the composite output index fell to 54.5
from 55.1 in August. Nonetheless, the index continued to signal a solid
increase in total business activity across China.
