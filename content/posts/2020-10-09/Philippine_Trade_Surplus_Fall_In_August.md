Imports fell 22.6 percent annually in August, following a 23.8 percent
drop in the previous month.

The trade surplus decreased to $2.075 billion in August from $3.00
billion in the same period last year. In July, the deficit was $1.859
billion.

Among major commodity groups, gold showed the biggest fall in exports
value, down by 31.3 percent. Exports of electronic products and fresh
bananas fell by 20.1 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively.
