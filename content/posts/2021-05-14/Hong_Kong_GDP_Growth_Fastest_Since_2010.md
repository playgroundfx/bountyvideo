Hong Kong's [economy][1] grew at the fastest pace in more than a decade
in the first quarter of 2021, revised data from the Census and
Statistics Department showed on Friday.

Ending six consecutive quarters of contraction, gross domestic product
grew by revised 7.9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, in
contrast to the 2.8 percent decrease in the fourth quarter.

A similar faster growth was last reported in the first quarter of 2010.
The annual growth rate was revised up marginally from 7.8 percent.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, real GDP grew notably by 5.4 percent
sequentially, much faster than the 0.5 percent expansion seen in the
preceding quarter. The rate was revised from the advance estimate of 5.3
percent.

The real GDP is forecast to grow in the range of 3.5 percent to 5.5
percent this year, unchanged from the previous projection.

However, the government cautioned that economic recovery was uneven and
overall economic activity remained below the pre-recession level, as the
pandemic continued to weigh on certain economic segments, particularly
those involving consumer-facing activities.

The forecast rates of underlying and headline consumer price inflation
for 2021 were maintained at 1 percent and 1.6 percent respectively in
the current round of review.
