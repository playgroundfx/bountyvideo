Policymakers are looking forward to review the Eurozone economic and
inflation outlook, and the duration to continue stimulus in the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) session in June, the minutes of the latest rate-setting session
of the European Central Bank showed Friday.  
  
Net asset purchases has hit the highest monthly purchase volume since
July 2020, reflecting a marked increase versus average purchases in the
first two months of this year, the ECB said. The sharp increase was
despite the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision being taken mid-March.  
  
"Members recalled that the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting in June would provide
the next opportunity to conduct a thorough assessment of financing
conditions and the inflation outlook," the minutes of the April 21-22
meeting, which the ECB calls "the account" showed.  
  
Policymakers would also be in possession of the latest set of ECB staff
macroeconomic projections in June to help them form the assessment.  
  
"Ample monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support remained crucial beyond the pandemic
period in order to support inflation and return it to the inflation
aim," the minutes said.

In the April meeting, the Governing Council reconfirmed its very
accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance, leaving interest rates and the
volume of asset purchases unchanged.  
  
Expectations of a rebound in the euro area [economy][1] has prompted
discussion on when the ECB will start withdrawing its massive EUR 1.85
trillion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. The scheme is set to run
till March next year.  
  
ING economist Carsten Brzeski expects the ECB to try to exit from
unconventional measures before the end of the year. Policymakers may not
necessarily discuss possible tapering at the June meeting but at the
latest, at the September meeting, the economist said.  
  
ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers noted that the progress with vaccination campaigns and
the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpin the
expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of this
year.  
  
"An extension of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme beyond March
2022 looks increasingly unlikely with the current vaccination and
economic backdrop, unless the ECB wants to walk down the very
controversial road of calling the pandemic over only when the economy
has returned to its pre-crisis level," Brzeski said.  
  
"In any case, the ECB will want to avoid any abrupt end to net asset
purchases and will therefore engage in its ownÂ twist: gradually ending
asset purchases under the PEPP while increasing them under the old Asset
Purchase Programme."

The monthly purchases under asset purchase programme is currently EUR 20
billion.  
  
While headline inflation picked up over recent months due to some
idiosyncratic and temporary factors and an increase in energy price
inflation, underlying price pressures remained subdued in the context of
significant economic slack and still weak demand, the ECB said.

However, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers remained cautious about a strong euro. "It was
underlined that a further appreciation of the exchange rate could have
adverse implications for the inflation outlook," the minutes said.
