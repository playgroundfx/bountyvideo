Consumer sentiment in the U.S. deteriorated by slightly less than
initially estimated in the month of October, the University of Michigan
revealed in a report released on Friday.

The report said the consumer sentiment index for October was upwardly
revised to 71.7 from the preliminary reading of 71.4.

While the upward revision surprised economists, who expected the index
to be unrevised, the final reading was still below September's 72.8.

The current economic conditions index slid to 77.7 in October from 80.1
in September, while the index of consumer expectations edged down to
67.9 from 68.1.

"The positive impact of higher income expectations and the receding
[coronavirus][1] has been offset by higher rates of inflation and
falling confidence in government economic policies," said Surveys of
Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin.

He added, "Consumers not only anticipated the highest year-ahead
inflation rate since 2008 in the October survey, consumers also
expressed greater uncertainty about the year-ahead inflation rate than
anytime in nearly forty years."

The report showed one-year inflation expectations rose to 4.8 percent in
October from 4.6 percent in September, while five-year inflation
expectations slipped to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent.
