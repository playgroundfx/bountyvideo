Portugal's economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter,
preliminary estimates from Statistics Portugal showed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 4.2 percent year-on-year following a 16.1
percent increase in the the second quarter.

Second quarter figures were boosted by base effect as activity in the
same quarter of 2020 was much affected by the [coronavirus][1] pandemic.

Consequently, domestic demand growth slowed in the third quarter. Net
external demand was more negative as imports growth outpaced that of
exports.

Compared to the previous three months, the [economy][2] expanded 2.9
percent after a 4.4 percent growth in the second quarter. The pace of
growth was the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2019.

This was largely attributed to the positive contribution from net
external demand which was negative in the previous quarter.

The gradual decrease of the restrictions to mobility imposed by the
pandemic, in line with the increase in vaccination against COVID-19
underpinned growth.
