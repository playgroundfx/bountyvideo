Chicago-area [business][1] activity unexpectedly grew at a faster rate
in the month of October, according to a report released by MNI
Indicators on Friday.

MNI Indicators said its Chicago business barometer climbed to 68.4 in
October from 64.7 in September, with a reading above 50 indicating
growth. The increase surprised economists, who had expected the business
barometer to dip to 63.5.

The unexpected advance by the business barometer was partly due to a
rebound by the new orders index, which climbed 3.1 points after hitting
a six-month low in September.

However, MNI Indicators noted some businesses said raw material
shortages and a low supply of critical components like semiconductors at
suppliers was impacting opportunities.

The report also showed the employment index increased for the fourth
straight month, rising 4.2 points to reach its highest level in just
over three years.

The order backlogs index also jumped by 13.5 points, recovering more
than half of the steep drop seen in the previous month.

With firms reporting worsening port congestion and ongoing logistical
issues with trucking, rail, and even air cargo, the supplier deliveries
also increased to 84.7.

Meanwhile, MNI Indicators said the production index was the only
component to decrease in October, falling by 2.2 points to its lowest
level since August 2020.
