The German [economy][1] expanded less than expected in the third
quarter, provisional data published by Destatis revealed on Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 1.8 percent sequentially, slightly slower
than the 1.9 percent expansion posted in the second quarter. Economists
had forecast a quarterly growth of 2.2 percent.

This was the second consecutive expansion after the 1.9 percent decline
posted at the start of the year. Destatis said the third quarter growth
was mainly attributable to higher household consumption expenditure.

On a yearly basis, [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)-adjusted GDP growth eased markedly to 2.5
percent, in line with expectations, from 9.8 percent in the second
quarter.  
  
On an unadjusted basis, GDP grew 2.5 percent in the third quarter, after
10.3 percent expansion seen in the preceding period. Detailed results
will be released on November 25.

The increase in GDP in Germany in the third quarter brought the economy
close to its pre-pandemic size and means the recovery phase is now
largely complete, Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics
said. Growth is set to slow sharply in the next quarter.
