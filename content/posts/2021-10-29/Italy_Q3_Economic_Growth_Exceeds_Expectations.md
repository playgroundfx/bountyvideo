Italy's economic growth slowed slightly in the third quarter but the
pace of growth exceeded expectations, flash data from the statistical
office Istat showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 2.6 percent sequentially, following the
second quarter's 2.7 percent increase. The growth was forecast to ease
to 2 percent.

On a yearly basis, GDP growth eased markedly to 3.8 percent from 17.0
percent in the second quarter. Nonetheless, this was also faster than
the economists' forecast of 3 percent.

The statistical office said the sequential growth was driven by gross
changes in inventories and exports. The third quarter revised data is
due on November 30.

The carry-over annual GDP growth for 2021 was equal to 6.1 percent.
