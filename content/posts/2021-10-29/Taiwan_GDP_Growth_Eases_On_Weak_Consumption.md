Edited headline

Taiwan's [economy][1] grew at a slower pace in the third quarter largely
due to the fall in household spending, advance estimates from the
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics showed Friday.

Gross domestic product grew 3.8 percent sequentially, much weaker than
the second quarter's 7.43 percent expansion. Economists had forecast an
expansion of 4 percent.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualized basis, GDP was up
2.27 percent, in contrast to the 4.21 percent fall in the second
quarter.

With virus cases now very low and the vaccine rollout gathering
momentum, GDP growth is expected to accelerate in the near term, Gareth
Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, said.

Real household consumption fell 5.49 percent from the second quarter
mainly reflecting the expenditure slump caused by pandemic restrictions,
and the high base effect. Meanwhile, growth in government spending
improved to 3.31 percent.

Gross capital formation surged 27.97 percent, primarily owing to the
surge of the investment in machinery equipment as well as transportation
equipment and construction.

Exports of goods and services climbed 14.05 percent due to the strong
foreign demand for electronic parts and ICT products. At the same time,
imports grew 19.37 percent.
