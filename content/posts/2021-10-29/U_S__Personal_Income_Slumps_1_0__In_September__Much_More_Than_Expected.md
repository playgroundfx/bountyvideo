A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed personal
income in the U.S. decreased by much more than expected in the month of
September.

The Commerce Department said personal income slumped by 1.0 percent in
September after inching up by 0.2 percent in August. Economists had
expected personal income to edge down by 0.2 percent.

Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current
taxes, also tumbled by 1.3 percent in September following a 0.1 percent
uptick in August.

The bigger than expected drop in personal income primarily reflected a
decrease in government social benefits, both in unemployment benefits
and "other" benefits.

Meanwhile, the report showed personal spending climbed by 0.6 percent in
September after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.0 percent in August.

Economists had expected personal spending to rise by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.

Excluding price changes, personal spending rose by 0.3 percent in
September after climbing by 0.6 percent in August.

With income slumping and sales rising, personal saving as a percentage
of disposable income dropped to 7.5 percent in September from 9.2
percent in August.

A reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal Reserve
showed the annual rate of core consumer price growth in September
remained at 3.6 percent for the fourth straight month.

"We expect core PCE inflation will peak above 4% in November and only
fall below 3.5% by April 2022, thereby testing the Fed's patience," said
Lydia Boussour, Lead US Economist at Oxford Economics.

"We continue to believe the Fed will avoid the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) error of
tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) too early in the face of supply-driven inflation, but
its outcome-based FAIT framework will come under increasing stress in Q1
2022," she added. "As such, the Fed could be pressured by [markets][1]
to raise rates earlier than our current forecast of December 2022."
