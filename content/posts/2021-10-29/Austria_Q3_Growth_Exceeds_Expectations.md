Austria's [economy][1] grew at a faster than expected rate in the third
quarter, though the pace of expansion slowed from the previous three
months, preliminary estimates from the WIFO economic institute showed
Friday.  
  
Gross domestic product grew 3.3 percent from the second quarter, when
the economy expanded 4.0 percent. Economists had forecast 2.5 percent
growth.  
  
The Covid-19 pandemic-related mobility restrictions were largely relaxed
or lifted in the third quarter, leading to a strong increase of 8.2
percent in household consumption.  
  
Consequently, the relevant service sector also expanded very strongly.
Meanwhile, industrial growth stagnated and construction output declined.  
  
Investments shrank after growth in the previous two quarters. Both
exports and imports decreased.  
  
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, GDP increased 4.8 percent
following a 12.6 percent jump in the second quarter.
