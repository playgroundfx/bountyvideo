A report released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed personal
income in the U.S. decreased by much more than expected in the month of
September.

The Commerce Department said personal income slumped by 1.0 percent in
September after inching up by 0.2 percent in August. Economists had
expected personal income to edge down by 0.2 percent.

The bigger than expected drop in personal income primarily reflected a
decrease in government social benefits, both in unemployment benefits
and "other" benefits.

Meanwhile, the report showed personal spending climbed by 0.6 percent in
September after jumping by an upwardly revised 1.0 percent in August.

Economists had expected personal spending to rise by 0.5 percent
compared to the 0.8 percent increase originally reported for the
previous month.
