The services sector in New Zealand continued to contract in October, and
at a faster pace, the latest survey from BusinessNZ revealed on Monday
with a Performance of Service Index score of 44.6.

That's down from the downwardly revised 46.5 in September (originally
46.9) and it moves further beneath the boom-or-bust line of 50 that
separates expansion from contraction.

Individually, employment was break-even at 50.0, while sales (43.7),
deliveries (37.1), stocks (46.6) and new orders (46.4) all contracted.

"The ongoing weakness in services overall - in contrast to the
improvement we saw in last week's Performance of Manufacturing Index -
fits with our thinking that any bounce in Q4 GDP will be modest,
especially in comparison to the decline in Q3," BNZ Senior Economist
Doug Steel said.
